  "Problem": "Consider a system involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions governed by linear differential equations, and i represents the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a different real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be uniquely determined by the original differential equations governing x and y?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional rotation which modifies the trajectory of the resultant complex function. This makes the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) contingent on both the original transformations (from B) and the intervention (from C), altering the trajectory and final position.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state of z(t) is determined by x(t) and y(t). Applying f(z) at time t1 transforms z(t) to z(T) for T > t1. Intervening with g(z) at t1 further modifies z(T). Thus, the final state of z(T) depends on the original differential equations for x(t) and y(t), as well as the transformations f(z) and g(z)."
