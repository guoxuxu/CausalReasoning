  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace Transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is a known system transfer function. We explore the scenario using an additional feedback transformation defined by \\\\( G(y) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1}Y(s) \\\\), which modifies the output.\n\nIf the feedback transformation \\\\( G(Y) \\\\\\) is applied after the initial system operations on \\\\( X(s) \\\\\\) where \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\\\), does the final output state depend solely on \\\\( H(s) \\\\\\), disregarding the feedback effect?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the feedback transformation significantly alters the output. The intervention with \\\\( G(Y) \\\\\\) feeds a part of the output back into the system, affecting the final output state. Therefore, both \\\\( H(s) \\\\\\) and the dynamics introduced by \\\\( G(Y) \\\\\\) shape the resulting \\\\( Y(s) \\\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input X(s) directly causes the intermediate output Y(s), and the system transfer function H(s) also directly causes Y(s). The feedback transformation G(y) modifies Y(s) but does not affect the direct dependence of Y(s) on X(s) and H(s)."
