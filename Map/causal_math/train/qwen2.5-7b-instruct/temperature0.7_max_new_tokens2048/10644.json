  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a time-dependent variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) denoted as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Now assume the introduction of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), which alters \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = x(t)f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing the end result in the Laplace domain, \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), can we accurately determine which transforms or modifications were applied only given this result without other context?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple potential combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) can lead to the same shift in the Laplace Transform output, \\\\( Y(s) \\\\). Without additional information about the initial state or the nature of interventions, it is impossible to definitively discern the specific modifications or sequential interventions applied to achieve \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of function f(t) = e^(at) leads to the modification of x(t) to z(t) = x(t)f(t), and the Laplace transform of z(t) results in Y(s) from X(s)."
