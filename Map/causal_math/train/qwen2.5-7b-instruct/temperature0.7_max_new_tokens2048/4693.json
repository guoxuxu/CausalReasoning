  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state vector. We investigate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix, applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to the state evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially changes the starting condition to \\\\( e^{Dt_0}z_0 \\\\), thus affecting the subsequent evolution. This initial transformation by \\\\( D \\\\) shifts the trajectory, producing a different state at time \\\\( T \\\\) due to the compounded effect of both the exponential transformation by \\\\( D \\\\) and the system dynamics under \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) = e^(Dt)z at time t_0 followed by evolution according to z(t) = Ce^(At)z_0 results in the same state z(T) as evolving z_0 directly under z(t) = Ce^(At)z_0 for T > t_0."
