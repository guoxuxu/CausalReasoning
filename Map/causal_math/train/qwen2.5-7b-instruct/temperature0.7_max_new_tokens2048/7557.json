  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We study the impact of a transformation performed by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), influencing the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) can significantly alter the dynamics of the system, resulting in a different state at time T, depending on the relative properties of M and N.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under \\(\\dot{z}=Mz\\) results in the same z(t) at t=T as directly evolving z_0 to t=T under \\(\\dot{z}=Mz\\)."
