  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar, is analyzed for its effects over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the equations?",
  "Explanation": "Initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) leading to \\\\( z_0' = e^{C*0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as time evolves, the impact of the exponential function \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) will continuously interact with and modify the path set out by the differential equations for x and y. This interaction changes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) compared to its evolution solely governed by A and B.",
