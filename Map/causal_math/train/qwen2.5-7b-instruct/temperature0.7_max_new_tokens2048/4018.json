  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} u(t) dt \\\\) applied to a function u(t). We study how applying another transformation \\\\( S[u](t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) either before or after T affects relations.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( y(x) = T[u](x) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( S \\\\) was applied prior to T?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the transformed function y(x) after T does not inherently reveal if S was applied. Both transformations (with or without applying S first) could lead to different original functions u that still produce the same resultant y under T, especially without more constraints on the initial u.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation T to u(t) results in y(x), while applying S to u(t) yields an intermediate function that, if transformed by T, leads to y(x). The original function u(t) cannot be uniquely determined from y(x) alone without knowing if S was applied before T."
