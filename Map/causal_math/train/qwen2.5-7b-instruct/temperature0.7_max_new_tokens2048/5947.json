  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario involving integral transformations. Let \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be a holomorphic function in a region \\\\( R \\\\). We examine the effect of transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_C K(z, s) f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\) is a kernel function also holomorphic in some domain of \\\\( R \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point another transformation \\\\( U \\\\), defined by \\\\( U[f](z) = \\\\int_D M(z, t) f(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another contour and \\\\( M \\\\) a different kernel), is applied to \\\\( f \\\\) after \\\\( T \\\\), will the endpoint function \\\\( h(z) = U[T[f]](z) \\\\) be solely determined by the properties of \\\\( f \\\\) and not the characteristics of \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compositional nature of \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) means the final function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) depends critically not only on \\\\( f \\\\) but also the properties and interaction of both kernels \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\). The successive transformations can create complex relationships that are dependent on the details of both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) directly influences h(z) through the transformations T and U, such that T[f](z) and U[T[f]](z) both lead to h(z), making h(z)'s properties dependent on f(z), T, and U."
