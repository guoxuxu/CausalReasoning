  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L: V \\\\rightarrow W \\\\) mapping between vector spaces V and W. We analyze the effect of a specific transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described as a multiplication by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), acting on vector space V before and after applying operator L.\n\nIf an intervention transform \\\\( S(v) = Nv \\\\), where N is another matrix, is applied at some stage before applying L, will the final output in W only depend on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) can alter the vectors in such a way that the final outcome is a function of M, N, and L. If these matrices don't commute, each can uniquely influence the resultant vector in W.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention S(v) = Nv transforms the input vector v before it is acted upon by L, while M transforms v in V before L. The final output in W depends only on L, with S and M affecting the input but not altering L's effect."
