  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts evolving over time t governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\) where P and Q are complex constants. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z dt \\\\) where S is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by another function \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{Ut}z dt \\\\) (where U is a complex constant matrix), will the future state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by the characteristics of P, S, and U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), adding complexity to the system's trajectory and making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the initial dynamics governed by P, the transformation S applied initially, and the new intervention U. Each component contributes uniquely to the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
