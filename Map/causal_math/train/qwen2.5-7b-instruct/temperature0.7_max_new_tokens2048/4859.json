  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by a partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Pz = 0 \\), where \\( P \\) is a differential operator. Consider applying an integral transform \\( H \\) as defined by \\( z(t) \\mapsto \\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\) for complex \\( s \\).\n\nIf an additional operator \\( Q \\) intervenes at some time \\( t_1 \\) altering the differential equation to \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Qz = 0 \\), will the final state of \\( z(s) \\), after applying \\( H \\), depend solely on \\( P \\) and not on \\( Q \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( Q \\) modifies the governing equation and changes the system’s characteristics. The final transformed state \\( z(s) \\) depends on both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), as the new operator affects the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, thus impacting the integral transform outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
