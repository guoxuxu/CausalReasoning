  "Problem": "Consider a response system described by \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty h(t) x(z-t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transform applied to the system's output, where the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf a specific input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) such as a unit step function is applied, and the system's output \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is then Fourier transformed without any additional intervention, will the Fourier transform of the output \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) directly correspond to the Fourier transform of the input \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) \\\\) multiplied by the Fourier transform of the impulse response \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, due to the properties of linear time-invariant systems and convolution, the output \\\\( u(t) \\\\) which is the convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), directly leads to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) = \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) \\\\) under Fourier transform, reflecting the frequency domain multiplication of the input and the system's impulse response.",
