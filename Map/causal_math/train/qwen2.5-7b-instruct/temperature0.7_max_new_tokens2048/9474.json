  "Problem": "Consider a model described by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function. An external influence is introduced by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, different initial conditions could lead to the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The multiplicative effect of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) makes it impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) since both the magnitude and phase could have been altered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
