  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by a matrix \\( M \\) in a vector space and its effect on the vector \\( x \\). The transformation is then followed by an integral transformation represented by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\} \\), which is the Laplace transform of the vector function \\( x(t) \\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ Mx(t) \\} \\), can we always uniquely recover \\( x(t) \\) without knowing \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\( x(t) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ Mx(t) \\} \\) requires knowing \\( M \\), as \\( M \\) could be non-invertible or have nullifying effects on elements of \\( x(t) \\), obstructing unique recovery.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
