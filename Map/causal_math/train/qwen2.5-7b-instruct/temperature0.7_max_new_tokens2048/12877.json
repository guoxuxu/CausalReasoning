  "Problem": "Analyze a network system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region, where u represents potential at any point. An external field represented by the function \\\\( v(x, y, z) = e^{Ax + By + Cz} \\\\) (A, B, C are constants) is applied to the region at time t = 0.\n\nGiven the potential distribution \\\\( u(x, y, z, T) \\\\) at a time T, can we reliably deduce whether the external field \\\\( v(x, y, z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\\\( u(x, y, z, T) \\\\) could correspond to different potential initial conditions including with or without the applied external field. The influence of boundaries and other initial conditions complicate the exact back-calculation to the state at t = 0.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
