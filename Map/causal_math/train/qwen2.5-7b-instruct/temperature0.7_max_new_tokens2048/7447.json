  "Problem": "We consider an electrical system modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), representing the impedance as a function of complex frequency \\\\( s \\\\). An intervention is applied by modifying the system impedance through an additional component described as \\\\( H(s) = e^{-st}Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied midway, introducing a new impedance model \\\\( K(s) = e^{-sut}Z(s) \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) is a real constant, does the final system’s response depend only on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( t \\\\) or \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new model \\\\( K(s) \\\\) introduces another exponential factor which changes the overall impedance of the system again. Thus, the final impedance characteristics at any \\\\( s = j\\\\omega \\\\) are influenced not only by Z(s) but also significantly by both factors \\\\( t \\\\) and \\\\( u \\\\) from intervening terms \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-sut} \\\\), impacting the system's response.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "H(s) is derived from Z(s) through the transformation involving t, and K(s) is derived from Z(s) through the transformation involving both t and u. Therefore, the final system’s response depends on Z(s), t, and u."
