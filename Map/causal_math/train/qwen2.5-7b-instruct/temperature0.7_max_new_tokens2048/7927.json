  "Problem": "Consider a system given by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) represents an input function to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) at different time points on system behavior.\n\nIf an intervention using a transformation \\\\( k(y) = e^{Ct}y \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system output at time T (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) be solely influenced by the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\), and not by \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(y) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the system's evolution. The final output at T is now influenced by the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and the effects of both transformations (\\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)), as they may modify how the contributions of the input function \\\\( u(s) \\\\) accumulate over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(t) → y(t); A → y(t); Bt → h(y); Ct → k(y); t1 → k(y); k(y) → y(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The system output y(t) is primarily influenced by A through the integral equation. Applying the transformation k(y) = e^(Ct)y at time t1 modifies y(t) but does not change the fundamental influence of A on y(t). Thus, the output y(T) for T > t1 is still mainly determined by A, independent of B and C."
