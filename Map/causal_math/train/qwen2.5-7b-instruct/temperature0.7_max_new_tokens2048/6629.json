  "Problem": "Consider a thermodynamic system where the temperature \\( T \\) inside a reactor is controlled by a function \\( u(t, T) = kT + c \\), where \\( k \\) and \\( c \\) are constants. Here, \\( k \\) represents a proportional control on the temperature, and \\( c \\) is a constant heating term. We explore scenarios applying a linear transformation function \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants, altering \\( T \\) at various instants.\n\nIf \\( v(T) \\) is applied to the reactor temperature \\( T_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( T \\) is allowed to evolve under \\( u(t, T) \\) without further intervention, will the temperature \\( T(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( T_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( u(t, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) modifies the baseline temperature \\( T_0 \\) to \\( mT_0 + n \\), which changes the initial conditions for the control function \\( u(t, T) \\). The proportional and constant terms in \\( u(t, T) \\) will therefore start from and act on this altered initial temperature, leading to a different temperature profile over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation v(T) to the initial temperature T_0 changes the starting point for the evolution of T under the control function u(t, T), which means the temperature T(t) at t = T after applying v(T) and then evolving under u(t, T) will generally differ from the temperature T(t) at t = T when T_0 evolves directly under u(t, T) without the initial transformation."
