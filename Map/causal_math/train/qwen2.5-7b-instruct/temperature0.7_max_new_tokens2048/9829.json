  "Problem": "Consider a system where the evolution of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The impact of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduces an additional scaling and phase shift factor \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), which alters the growth and rotation rates of the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This leads to a different trajectory and final state at time T than if no transformation were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of ω determines the rate of change of z with respect to time, k defines the transformation applied to z, t specifies the time at which z is evaluated, applying the transformation f(z_0) at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under the differential equation results in z(t) being equivalent to evolving z_0 directly under the differential equation from t=0 to t=T."
