  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) in a complex domain, defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\). The causal inference involves analyzing transformations through the function and the reverse mapping from the function back to its inputs.\n\nIf the operation \\\\( g(u) = u + 1 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z \\\\), and no further manipulation is performed, will the transformed output, identified by \\\\( u = f(x, y) \\\\), remain exclusively dependent on the original inputs \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) simply translates \\\\( z \\\\) linearly in the complex plane, but does not affect the dependency on \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). Thus, the function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) still retains its original dependency solely on these variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
