  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) defined by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion). We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (\\\\( f(X) \\\\), \\\\( g(X) \\\\), or both), purely based on the knowledge of \\\\( X(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of applied transformations due to the overlapping effects of exponential growth/decay factors introduced by \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), alongside the inherent randomness introduced by the Wiener process. This makes it impossible to precisely decipher the sequence or presence of specific transformations from the endpoint alone.",
