  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) which maps complex numbers under the transformation \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\). We study its effects on waves modeled by the integral transformation \\\\(x(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} z(w)e^{iwt} dw\\\\).\n\nIf we initially apply \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\) to a wave function with a specific frequency domain, and allow the wave to propagate without any intervention, does \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T remain the same compared to direct computation at T without any transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\) essentially alters the phase of each frequency component. When calculating \\\\(x(t)\\\\) after the transformation, the phase shift introduced by \\\\(e^{iw}\\\\) results in a change of the waveform, affecting both amplitude and phase. This makes the wave at time T different from what would be obtained by just evolving the original wave without transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(w) = e^(iw) transforms the wave function, and this transformation affects x(t) through the integral. The value of x(t) at time T depends on the initial wave function and the transformation applied."
