  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is produced by applying a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The output is then transformed by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze how these transformations affect the relationship between input and output over time t.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of the initial impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), remains dependent on the system's initial impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) even after the intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) alters the mode of propagation but does not negate the effects of the impulse response, which fundamentally governs the relationship between the input and the initial output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) and the impulse response h(t) determine the initial output z(t), which evolves over time according to the function f(z) = e^At*z. An intervention g(z) = e^Bt*z at time t1 modifies z(t) such that z(T) for T > t1 depends on both the initial conditions and the interventions applied."
