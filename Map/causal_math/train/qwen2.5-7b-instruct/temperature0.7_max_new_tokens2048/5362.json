  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original starting complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, and given that A can alter the phase and magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), it's not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple potential starting points can lead to the same endpoint due to the non-trivial effects of A.",
