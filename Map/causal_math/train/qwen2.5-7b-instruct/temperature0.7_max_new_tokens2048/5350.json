  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod along the x-axis is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t}h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a spatial function and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) a decay constant, is applied.\n\nIs it possible to determine the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied, and given the decay and influence of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) in the transformation, it is impossible to determine with certainty the original unmodified state of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\); \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could significantly modify the initial conditions.",
