  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of electrical impedance in a circuit as a function of the frequency, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega) = R + \\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C} + j\\\\omega L\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) are resistance, capacitance, and inductance respectively, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Z(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to study the system's response.\n\nCan we determine with certainty whether an additional capacitor was added and its value after observing the impedance \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) at various frequencies, merely based on the impedance values?",
  "Explanation": "Although changes in impedance may indicate modifications in circuit parameters, it is not possible to uniquely ascertain the addition of a capacitor and its specific value without broader data on the circuit changes, as similar impedance profiles can be produced by various configuration changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resistance, capacitance, inductance, and angular frequency each contribute to determining the impedance Z(ω) in a circuit."
