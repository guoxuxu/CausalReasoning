  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of applying an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(h) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}h(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and T is a fixed time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = T \\\\) and then the integral transform \\\\( g(h) \\\\) is applied, will the result be the same as directly applying the transform to \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) without initially specifying the range?",
  "Explanation": "Specifying the range from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = T \\\\) before applying the integral transform confines the integration within these bounds. Applying the integral transform directly to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without this specification potentially considers a different domain for \\\\( z \\\\), affecting the output due to the changing limits of integration.",
