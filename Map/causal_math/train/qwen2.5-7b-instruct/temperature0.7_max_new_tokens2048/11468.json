  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We analyze the behavior of the function under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from different sequences and types of transformations due to the intrinsic properties of exponential operations in the complex plane. This overlapping of potential effects makes it difficult to identify the specific transformations used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
