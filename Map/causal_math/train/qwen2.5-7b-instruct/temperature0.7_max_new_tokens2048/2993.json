  "Problem": "Consider a vector space V over complex numbers, governed by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\). The causal structure of the system is manipulated using a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(t) e^{-iwt} dt \\\\), where w represents angular frequency and v(t) is a vector in V at time t.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to a vector \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve under the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), will the output at time t = T, denoted by \\\\( u(T) \\\\), align with the output obtained by directly evolving \\\\( v(0) \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the frequency domain representation of \\\\( v(t) \\\\). When this transformed vector evolves under \\\\( L \\\\), the influence of its frequency components alters the trajectory of the vector within the space. Hence, \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will differ from what would have resulted from evolving \\\\( v(0) \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\) due to these frequency-domain modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the initial vector v(0) (F(w)) and the linear operator L together determine the state of the vector u(T) at time T, meaning that applying the Fourier transform to v(0) and then evolving under L to time T yields the same result as directly evolving v(0) under L to time T."
