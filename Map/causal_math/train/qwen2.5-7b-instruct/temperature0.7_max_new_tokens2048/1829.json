  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix providing a linear transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is initially applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is left to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T evolve in the same manner as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) at the initial time changes the starting point to \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). The evolution of this new initial state under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) results in \\\\( x(t) = e^{Dt}Mx_0 \\\\), which is generally distinct from \\\\( e^{Dt}x_0 \\\\) unless M commutes with \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(x0) to the initial state x0 before evolving it under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) for time T results in the same final state x(t) as directly evolving x0 under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) for the same time period."
