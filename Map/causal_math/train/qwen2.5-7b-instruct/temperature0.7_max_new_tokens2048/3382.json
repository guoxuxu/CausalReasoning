  "Problem": "Consider assessing the stability of a system described by a Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\frac{U(s)}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants and \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is a known function in the s-domain. We evaluate the effect of the inverse Laplace transform given by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{Y(s)\\\\} \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the time response \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we determine the original values of a and b accurately without any additional intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of exact values of a and b from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) purely based on the observed output can be intricate due to possible non-uniqueness in the inversion of Laplace transforms and overlapping influences of a and b on the dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
