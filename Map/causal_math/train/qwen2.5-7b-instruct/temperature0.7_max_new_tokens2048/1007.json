  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined over time, where the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time t is influenced by \\\\(z_0\\\\) and a transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) a real constant. We investigate the role of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Bz\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(g(z) = Cz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is another constant matrix, is applied at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the dynamics defined by \\\\(A\\\\) and not on the transformations by \\\\(B\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interjection of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) modifies the trajectory from \\\\(t_1\\\\) onwards, leading to a terminal state of \\\\((e^{iA(T-t_1)})(Cz(t_1))\\\\). This state is influenced by both the dynamic matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and the intervention matrices \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), affecting the state evolution in intricate ways.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 and the constant A directly determine z(t). The transformations B and C affect z(t) only up to t_1; after t_1, z(t) depends on z(t_1) which is influenced by B, but not directly by C. Ultimately, z(T) depends on the dynamics defined by A and the state at t_1, which can be indirectly influenced by B."
