  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of the transformation given by the function \\\\( g(u) = v^{Dx}u \\\\) over spatial domain x, where \\\\(D\\\\) is a constant operator and \\\\(v\\\\) is a function of x.\n\nCan we recover the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 from the state \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), the transformation \\\\( v^{Dx} \\\\) may have changed the initial conditions in an irreversible way, especially if \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\) do not commute, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of the function u at time t (u(x, t)) causally influences the original function u_0 at time 0 through the inverse of the transformation g, assuming g is invertible. The application of g transforms u_0 into u(x, t), so applying the inverse of g to u(x, t) recovers u_0."
