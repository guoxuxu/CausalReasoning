  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant voltage source V and a linear resistor R in series with a capacitor C. The charge Q on the capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\\\frac{V - Q/C}{R}\\\\). We study the impact of applying a sinusoidal function \\\\(f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) as an external forcing term to the circuit.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(Q(T)\\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\(f(t)\\\\), \\\\(g(t)\\\\), or both), just by knowing the end charge without further data about intervening functions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential overlap of effects from different types of sinusoidal functions, multiple combinations of amplitude, frequency, or even function types could lead to the same charge \\\\(Q(T)\\\\). Without additional data about the interventions, it is impossible to distinguish precisely which functions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A sinusoidal forcing function f(t) directly influences the charge Q on the capacitor, while the resistance R and capacitance C also directly influence Q. The voltage V provides a constant input that indirectly affects Q through its interaction with R and C."
