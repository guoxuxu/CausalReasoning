  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. This function is subjected to an integral transform, specifically a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is Fourier transformed without any modifications, will the transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega = w \\\\) be a Dirac delta function?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) results in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - w) \\\\), concentrating all energy at the frequency \\\\( w \\\\), which directly corresponds to the original function's frequency. Thus, the output is indeed a delta function at the specific frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
