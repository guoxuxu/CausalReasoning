  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system expressed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then subjected to a Laplace Transform, transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{C}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{C}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{C}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), it is uniquely implicative of the original function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The structure of the Laplace Transform in this particular form is a direct indication of the specific type of sinusoidal function in the complex exponential form with constants \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
