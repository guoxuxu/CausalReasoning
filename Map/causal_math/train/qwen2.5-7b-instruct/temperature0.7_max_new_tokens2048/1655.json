  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Nt} z \\\\, dt \\\\), with N also being a constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time T.\n\nIf an intervention using a different transformation \\\\( k(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{P t}z dt \\\\) (where P is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) rely solely on the evolution dictated by M, disregarding the effects of N and P?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) change the system's state fundamentally by integrating different exponential impacts over time. Therefore, the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the compounded effects of N, P, and the underlying dynamics of M, not solely M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) is influenced by the matrix M through its effect on the system's dynamics, while the transformations h(z) and k(z) introduce additional influences from matrices N and P respectively, but do not directly affect z(T) after the initial time period."
