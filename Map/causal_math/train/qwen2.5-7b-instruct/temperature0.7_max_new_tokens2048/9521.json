  "Problem": "In a fluid dynamics context, we consider the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. To study the effect of a varying thermal diffusivity, a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modulates \\\\( k \\\\) as \\\\( k(t) = k_0 h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k_0 \\\\) being the initial thermal diffusivity.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is integrated into the heat equation from the start without further manipulation, will the temperature profile \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to a scenario where \\\\( h(t) = 1 \\\\) for all \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), by altering the value of \\\\( k \\\\), impacts the rate at which temperature diffuses through the medium. Variations in \\\\( k(t) \\\\) alter the heat equation's behavior, leading to a different temperature profile at time \\\\( T \\\\) compared to when \\\\( k \\\\) is constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The modulation of thermal diffusivity by \\( h(t) \\) affects the rate of change of temperature with respect to time (\\( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\)), which in turn influences the second spatial derivative of the temperature profile (\\( \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\)). Therefore, the temperature profile \\( T(x,T) \\) at a later time \\( T \\) will differ if \\( h(t) \\neq 1 \\) for all \\( t \\)."
