  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), with \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) a fixed complex constant. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the scaling factor introduced by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) remains ambiguous. This uncertainty about the scaling transformation makes it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
