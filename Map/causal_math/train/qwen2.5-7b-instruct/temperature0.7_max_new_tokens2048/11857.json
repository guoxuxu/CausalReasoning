  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct} z(t) dt \\\\) is explored, where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after computing \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\), without knowing if the transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) compiles the effects of complex exponential matrix transformations overlaid on the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\). Without knowledge of its application, the integrated form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) via \\\\( F(z) \\\\) obscures the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because of the cumulative and non-invertible aggregation of system states.",
