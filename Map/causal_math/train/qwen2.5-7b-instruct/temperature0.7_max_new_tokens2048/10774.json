  "Problem": "A mechanical system's position as a function of time is determined by the integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p(t) \\\\dot{x} + q(t)x = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) are given functions. We analyze the impact of a control intervention defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = x + ct^2 \\\\) where c is a constant.\n\nGiven the observation of the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the exact initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(0) \\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the initial conditions were modified by \\\\( h(x) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(0) \\\\). The intervention could impart an additional quadratic component that would be indistinguishable at time T just from the position data.",
