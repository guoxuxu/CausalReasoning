  "Problem": "Consider an integral transform scenario where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} x(s) ds \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and y is a constant vector, is applied to the system, and we are interested in understanding its effects at time T.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), the function \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is altered through intervention to \\\\( x(s) = e^{Cs}w \\\\) (C being a new matrix and w a new vector), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be unaffected by the initial conditions set by B and y?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the trajectory set by B and y, introducing new dynamics with C and w. This alteration will modify the way \\\\( z(t) \\\\) integrates these influences, making the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) a result of both segments of x over time (pre- and post-intervention), hence dependent on both sets of conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
