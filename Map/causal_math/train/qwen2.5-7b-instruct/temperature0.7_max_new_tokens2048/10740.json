  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a vector space using a matrix M and its exponential \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) which acts on vectors in the space. We investigate the effects of initial transformations \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\), where N is another matrix, on the temporal evolution of vectors.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations were used (whether \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\), \\\\(g(x) = e^{Lt}x\\\\), both, or neither), solely from the endpoint information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), multiple transformation sequences (using N, M, L, or any combinations) can result in the same final state, especially considering potential interactions among the matrices. Without additional information about the transformations at specific times, it's impossible to uniquely determine the historical sequence used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint value x(T) is influenced by the transformation matrix (either N or L or both), the initial vector x, and the time T. The specific transformation used (f or g) directly affects x(T)."
