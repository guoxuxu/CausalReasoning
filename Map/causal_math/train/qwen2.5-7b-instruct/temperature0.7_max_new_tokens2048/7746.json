  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional linear dynamical system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), with M being a 2x2 constant matrix. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another 2x2 constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be uniquely determined without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced because the transformation by D could have altered it in such a way that multiple initial states could result in the same observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially when D does not commute with M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
