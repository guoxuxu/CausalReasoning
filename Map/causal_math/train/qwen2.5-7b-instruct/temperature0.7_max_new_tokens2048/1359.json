  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. The function describes a circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) on this periodic function.\n\nIf an additional damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\)) is introduced at some time t = 0 and then the function is transformed, will the Laplace transform still indicate a simple harmonic motion?",
  "Explanation": "By introducing a damping factor, the transformed function changes to \\\\( \\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i\\omega} \\\\), where the original undamped simple harmonic form is altered, showing an exponential decay in amplitude, thus indicating damped harmonic motion instead of simple harmonic.",
