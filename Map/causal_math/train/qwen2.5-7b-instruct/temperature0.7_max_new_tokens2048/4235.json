  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time system represented by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( u(s) \\\\) a varying vector function of time. Study the effect of applying a temporal shift transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\), with \\\\( \\tau \\\\) a time shift constant and \\\\( B \\\\) another matrix.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new transformation \\\\( g(u) = e^{C\\sigma} u(t-\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is another time shift) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be only influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) and not by \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) = e^{C\\sigma} u(t-\\sigma) \\\\) further modifies the input function and thus changes the system's output integrally influenced by matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). Each transformation shifts and scales the input in different ways, affecting the resulting integration process and the system’s state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input u(s) directly influences the system's state y(t). Applying the transformation g(u) at time t1 does not change the fact that y(T) for T > t1 is primarily influenced by A, rather than B or C."
