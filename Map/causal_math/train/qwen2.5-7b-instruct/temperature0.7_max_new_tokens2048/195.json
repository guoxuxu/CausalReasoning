  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its derivative \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it}\\\\) in a system over time, focusing on how transformations affect causal inference.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a function \\\\(g(t) = t^{2}e^{-t}\\\\) occurs at a midpoint \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the function form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at T > t_1 be determined solely by the derivative \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it}\\\\) and not get affected by the initial \\\\(f(t)\\\\) multiplication?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(t)\\\\) introduces new dynamics that are compounded with the effects of the initial function \\\\(f(t)\\\\). This results in an altered trajectory that depends on both the initial condition changes from \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and the new dynamics set by \\\\(g(t)\\\\). The system's outcome at time T is therefore influenced by both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
