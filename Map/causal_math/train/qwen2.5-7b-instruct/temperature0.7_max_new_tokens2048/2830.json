  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow system governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional region. Suppose the velocity field is represented as \\\\( \\\\vec{u} = (u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t)) \\\\) and governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. An external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} = (f_x(x,y,t), f_y(x,y,t)) \\\\) can be controlled as an intervention.\n\nFrom the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x, y, T) \\\\), can the exact initial velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x, y, 0) \\\\) be determined without knowing the system's viscosity \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) depends on the viscosity \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\), and this parameter critically affects how perturbations and flows evolve over time. Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\), one cannot uniquely backtrack to determine the exact initial conditions from the state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
