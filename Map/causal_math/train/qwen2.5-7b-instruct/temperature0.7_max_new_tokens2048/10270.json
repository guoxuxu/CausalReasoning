  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) is applied and then \\\\(z\\\\) evolves according to the dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex number acting as a constant multiplier.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could have modified the initial condition in a way that affects the dynamics and ultimate observation at time T. The exponential function in complex analysis also introduces ambiguity in determining the exact initial condition due to its periodic nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
