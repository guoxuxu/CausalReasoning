  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\(u(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u\\\\) and investigate its implications over variable \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) is applied directly to \\\\(u(z)\\\\), will the result \\\\(F(u(z))\\\\) at \\\\(k\\\\) represent the same effect as evolving \\\\(u(z)\\\\) under a different linear transformation \\\\(v(z) = e^{Bz}u(z)\\\\) followed by applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(e^{Bz}\\\\) alters the function \\\\(u(z)\\\\) in the frequency domain in a unique way that cannot be mimicked merely by applying \\\\(F\\\\) directly to \\\\(u(z)\\\\). The properties of Fourier transforms with exponential factors lead to a shift in frequency space, which is distinct and depends critically on the matrix B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(z) is transformed by the Fourier transform to produce F(u(z)), while u(z) is also modified by the linear transformation v(z) = e^(Bz) * u(z) before being subjected to the Fourier transform to produce F(v(z)). The result at k represents the effect of the Fourier transform on the differently transformed u(z)."
