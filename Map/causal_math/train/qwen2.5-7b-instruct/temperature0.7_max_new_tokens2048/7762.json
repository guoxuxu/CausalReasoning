  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is analytically mapped using a Mobius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, d \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) exactly after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, just by solving \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of the Mobius transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately backtrack to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had altered it. The rotational motion under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) alone does not provide sufficient data to reverse-engineer the effects of \\\\( f \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(t) at time t influences z(T) at time T through the differential equation dz/dt = iωz, and z(T) can be traced back to z(t) by solving this equation."
