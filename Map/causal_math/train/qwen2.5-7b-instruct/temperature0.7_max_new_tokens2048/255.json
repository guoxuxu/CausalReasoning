  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transformation of a real-valued function \\(\\psi(t)\\) defined as \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\). We explore the impact of a linear differential operator \\(L = d/dt + a\\), where \\(a\\) is a constant, applied to \\(\\psi(t)\\).\n\nIf a new function \\(\\phi(t) = \\psi(t) e^{at}\\) is applied as an intervention at some \\(t_0\\), will the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega)\\) at any future time depend solely on the transformation caused by \\(L\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function \\(\\phi(t)\\) alters the original function \\(\\psi(t)\\) by a multiplicative exponential factor, which affects the Fourier transform, thereby making the final \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega)\\) dependent not only on \\(L\\) but also significantly on the nature and timing of the intervention.",
