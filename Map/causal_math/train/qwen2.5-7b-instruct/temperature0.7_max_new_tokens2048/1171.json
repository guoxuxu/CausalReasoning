  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions describing a physical system. We investigate a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency, applied to this system over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\) (with \\( \\theta \\) as another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on \\( \\lambda \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\theta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the additional intervention \\( g(z) \\), the final state \\( z(T) \\) at time T will deviate from being solely dependent on \\( \\lambda \\), influenced by both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\). These transformations introduce complex rotations and scaling to the trajectory, impacting the resulting state at \\( z(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time t directly influences the endpoint z(T) through transformations f and g, while specific times t_1, constants ω, and θ influence z indirectly through their respective transformations."
