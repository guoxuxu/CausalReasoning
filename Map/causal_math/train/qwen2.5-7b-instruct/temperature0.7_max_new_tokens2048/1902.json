  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the initial value problem defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{du}{dx} + q(x)u = 0 \\\\) with initial conditions. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to simplify this differential equation to a form involving complex functions.\n\nCan we determine the functions \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) from the transformed equation alone, under the assumption of no initial knowledge about the form or properties of \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed equation blends the effects of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) into a complex function form, obscuring direct information about the individual functions. Identification of these functions separately would generally require additional information beyond the transformed expression alone.",
