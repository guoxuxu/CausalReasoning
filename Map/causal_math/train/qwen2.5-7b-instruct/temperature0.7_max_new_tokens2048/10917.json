  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a time-varying two-dimensional system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant 2x2 matrix. We explore the consequence of intervention through a transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\), where \\\\(N\\\\) is another constant 2x2 matrix.\n\nAssuming a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at t = 0 and is subsequently projected by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) up to time T, will the resulting vector \\\\(z(T)\\\\) match the trajectory created by evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) from t = 0 to T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\) at t = 0 modifies the starting conditions, hence altering the subsequent evolution path dictated by \\\\(M\\\\). As a result, the trajectory and endpoint at time T will differ due to the influence of \\\\(N\\\\) on the system's dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector z_0 evolves into z(t) under the dynamics defined by M. The transformation h(z) applied at t=0 changes z_0 to z(0), which then evolves under M to z(T). Without the transformation, z_0 directly evolves to z(T) under M. Therefore, whether the resulting vector z(T) matches depends on the matrices M and N."
