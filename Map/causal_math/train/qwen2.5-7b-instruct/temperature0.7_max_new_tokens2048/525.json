  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z = \\\\int_0^T e^{st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is used to transform an input function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over a time interval [0, T] with a complex parameter s. The effect of transformations \\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\) and its inverse \\( h(t) = \\\\frac{f(t)}{t^2} \\) (for t ≠ 0) are analyzed on the transformed function z.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to an input function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and we calculate \\\\( z_g = \\\\int_0^T e^{st} g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), will \\\\( z_g \\\\) at T equal the original \\\\( z \\\\) calculated without using \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) modifies the input function, which directly affects the outcome of the integral. The presence of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) in the integrand changes substantially, altering the resulting transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(t) = t^2 f(t) to the input function f(t) results in a new integral z_g which depends on g(t), while the original integral z depends on f(t). These two integrals are not directly comparable as they represent different functions."
