  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of impulse action in a heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) on a domain \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative of u, and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian. The intervention is represented by applying a function \\\\( g(u) = u + h \\\\delta(x-x_0) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( x_0 \\\\).\n\nCan one uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from the state at time T, \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), knowing that no intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, in the context of the heat equation without any source or modification, the evolution is governed purely by diffusion. Knowing the state at later time \\\\( T \\\\), one can trace back uniquely to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under the assumptions of smoothness and appropriate boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function g(u) directly changes u. The time derivative u_t and the Laplacian Δu also directly change u. Knowing the state u(x,T) can help determine the initial state u_0 if no intervention was applied."
