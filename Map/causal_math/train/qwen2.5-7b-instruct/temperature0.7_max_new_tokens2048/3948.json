  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which maps time t onto the unit circle in the complex plane. Assuming we apply a transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), we investigate the effects and causal inferences from applying this transformation versus the natural evolution of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine which transformations (\\( g(z) \\), \\( f(z) \\), or both) were applied during the evolution, solely by observing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple paths can lead to the same endpoint \\( z(T) \\) due to the nature of the transformations. For instance, squaring or cubing at different times can lead to the same result \\( z(T) \\) seen in the complex unit circle, making it impossible to determine uniquely which operations were applied.",
