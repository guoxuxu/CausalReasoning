  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real number representing time. We are analyzing how the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t}dt \\\\) affects our understanding of the function's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), is it possible to completely reconstruct the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over all time without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "For a simple harmonic function like \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which has a non-zero Fourier Transform only at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), it is entirely feasible to reconstruct the function from its Fourier Transform. However, for more complex or noise-added signals, this might not always be true.",
