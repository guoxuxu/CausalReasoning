  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The impact of Laplace transformation on this system is analyzed by transforming \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) separately.\n\nMapping back from the Laplace transformations, is it possible to uniquely determine the initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Laplace transform can provide reconstructions of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), ambiguities due to possible commonalities in the pole structures of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) may lead to multiple possible candidates for \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\).",
