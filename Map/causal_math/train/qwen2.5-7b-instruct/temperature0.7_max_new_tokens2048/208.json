  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of a system whose state space representation is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a matrix of system parameters and C is the control input matrix. Consider a scenario where the control application is modeled by \\\\( u(t) = e^{Et}u_0 \\\\), with E being a constant matrix and \\\\( u_0 \\\\) as the initial control vector.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine unequivocally whether the control matrix was altered during the evolution, based purely on the final state observed?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could potentially correspond to multiple configurations and interventions concerning the control matrix and how \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was initially modified by E. Different combinations of matrix C and E can lead to similar or even identical states at time T, rendering it complex to decipher the exact control interventions without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The system parameters D and control input matrix C influence the final state x(T); the control matrix E determines the form of the control input u(t), which in turn affects the final state x(T); the initial control vector u(0) influences the control input u(t), which affects the final state x(T)."
