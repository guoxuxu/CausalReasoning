  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. The solution at any time can be transformed using a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and the system is evolved under \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(t) \\\\) at t = T exactly match the Fourier transformation of the state evolved to t = T under \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation is a linear operation and commutes with the linear differential operator \\\\(L\\\\) under the evolution of the system. Thus, applying the Fourier transformation initially or after the system has evolved will yield the same result.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u_0 directly causes the state u(t) at any time t, and the state u(t) directly causes its Fourier transform ̅u(t). Applying the Fourier transformation F(u) to the initial state u_0 results in ̅u(0), and evolving the state u under the equation u_t = Lu results in ̅u(t) that matches the Fourier transformation of u(t) at any time t."
