  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions modified by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) on the boundary \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) to solve for the internal values of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the boundary conditions are changed using \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) and the system is then solved using the Laplace equation without further interventions, will the use of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) provide an accurate solution for \\\\( z \\\\) inside domain \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) like the Laplace equation by transforming spatial derivatives into algebraic terms. Even with modified boundary conditions by \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\), as long as the Fourier transform is correctly applied taking into account these conditions, it can accurately solve for \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The boundary condition modification through h(x, y) influences z, which satisfies the Laplace equation ∇^2 z = 0, and applying the Fourier transform F(z) can provide an accurate solution for z within domain D."
