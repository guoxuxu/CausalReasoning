  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then the transformed function is allowed to evolve with time without any further processing, will the inverse Fourier transform applied at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) return the function to a form equivalent to \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a periodic function like \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Letting this spectral representation evolve over time without change and then applying an inverse Fourier transform effectively returns the function to its original periodic state at any given time \\\\( T \\\\).",
