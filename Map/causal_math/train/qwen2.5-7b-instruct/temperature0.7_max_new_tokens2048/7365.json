  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation of the form \\\\( y(x) = \\int_0^x K(x, t) y(t) dt + f(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a known function. We analyze the changes in function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) when a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) characterized by operator \\\\( L[y] = y + g \\\\), where \\\\( g \\\\) is an additional function, is applied to the integral equation.\n\nIf the function \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the integral equation at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\), changing the initial condition of the integral equation, will the solution \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at a later point \\\\( x = T \\\\) be identical to the solution had \\\\( L \\\\) not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) alters the initial part of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) adding \\\\( g \\\\) into the integral equation, thereby altering the entire trajectory of the solution \\\\( y(x) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T due to the dependencies in the integral equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation L at x=0 changes the initial condition y(0), which then influences the solution y(T) at a later point."
