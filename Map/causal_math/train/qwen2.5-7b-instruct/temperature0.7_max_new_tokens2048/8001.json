  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation under various conditions. We analyze the impact of a non-linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(v) = \\\\sinh(kv) \\\\) where k is a constant, on the initial velocity profile \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) of the fluid.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is applied to the initial velocity profile \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the Navier-Stokes equation without further intervention, will the velocity profile \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if the initial profile was directly evolved to t = T under the Navier-Stokes equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(v) \\\\) significantly alters the initial conditions by introducing non-linearities. The behavior of the system under the Navier-Stokes equation will be fundamentally different due to the altered initial state, resulting in a different velocity profile at any future time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the non-linear transformation g(v) to the initial velocity profile v(x, 0) results in a modified initial condition v(x, 0) → v(x, t), which then evolves over time according to the Navier-Stokes equation Navier-Stokes equation → v(x, t). This evolution differs from the scenario where v(x, 0) directly evolves to v(x, t) under the Navier-Stokes equation without the transformation."
