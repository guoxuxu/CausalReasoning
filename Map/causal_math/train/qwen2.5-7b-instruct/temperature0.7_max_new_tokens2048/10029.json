  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) applied to a complex plane transformation, and the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\). Evaluate the causal relationships regarding the modulation of the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) and the effect on the integral \\\\( I(z) \\\\).\n\nIf the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) is increased, impacting \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), will the result of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) be zero for any T?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( w \\\\) doesn’t change the integral's outcome for \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), which computes the average of a function tracing a unit circle in the complex plane over any total period T. Since these circles are centered at the origin and symmetric, the integral is zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
