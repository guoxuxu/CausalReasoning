  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is studied.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application or non-application of \\\\( T \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is not feasible. The transformation could alter initial conditions significantly, hindering the accurate back-calculation from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function z(0) directly influences z(T) through the application of the transformation T, and the transformation T applied to z(t) results in z(T) at time T."
