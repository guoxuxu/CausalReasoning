  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a bounded region \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). A boundary condition modification is introduced by the function \\\\(f(u) = u + k\\\\sin(u)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant, defined on the boundary \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\).\n\nCan the original boundary condition be precisely deduced from knowing the solution \\\\( u(x) \\\\) inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) at any time T, without knowing if \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the boundary condition modification through \\\\( f(u) \\\\), it becomes infeasible to precisely backtrack to the original boundary conditions because the solution inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) gives no explicit information about the nature of boundary condition applied, especially due to the added nonlinearity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The solution u(x) inside Ω influences the modified boundary condition on ∂Ω through the function f(u), which then can be used to deduce the original boundary condition."
