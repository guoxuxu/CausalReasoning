  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Xe^{At} \\\\) defining a complex dynamical system, where X is a complex matrix and A is a constant matrix. We are investigating how the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) affects the system behavior over the variable s.\n\nUpon observing the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the matrix A without other information about the initial conditions or matrix X?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional details about X or the initial conditions, the specific influences of A on the Laplace transform cannot be isolated, as multiple configurations of A could result in similar transformations in the presence of different X matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
