  "Problem": "Consider a multi-dimensional complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex initial vector. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without prior knowledge about \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) encodes information about both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) but does not allow for their independent identification without additional information. Knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\) is essential since it significantly affects how \\\\( x \\\\) propagates through the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform Z(s) of z(t) contains information about the initial vector x through the matrix exponential e^(At), which depends on the matrix A. Therefore, knowing Z(s) and A allows us to deduce x."
