  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on the solution.\n\nBy observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can you uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) if you don’t know whether the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T[z] \\\\), it’s impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as the transformation could have significantly altered the path, and the original conditions are obscured by the integration over the path.",
