  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. To study its behavior, we introduce an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) of the function.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) by inverse-transforming the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) if no additional information on intervention is provided?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) transformation for linear systems with unique initial conditions. By performing the inverse Laplace transform, we can retrieve the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) precisely, assuming no external intervention alters the system.",
