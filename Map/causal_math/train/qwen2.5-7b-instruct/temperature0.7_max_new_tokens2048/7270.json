  "Problem": "Examine the effect of integrating a complex function using different contours in the complex plane. We consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) varies over different contours.\n\nGiven a nonzero integral result, can we determine that the contour must have enclosed the singularity \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the integral over a contour of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\) is nonzero, it indicates the presence of the singularity \\\\( a \\\\) within the enclosed area of the contour, based on the residue theorem. This is because the nonzero result arises from the contribution of residues at singular points enclosed by the contour.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If a contour encloses the singularity a, then it results in a nonzero integral for the function f(z) = e^(z^2)/(z - a); having a nonzero integral implies that the contour encloses the singularity a."
