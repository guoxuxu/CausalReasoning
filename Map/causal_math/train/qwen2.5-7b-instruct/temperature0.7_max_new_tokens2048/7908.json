  "Problem": "Using a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in a dynamical system, analyze its evolution under a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} - az \\\\) with a real constant a. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t) is considered.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a specific time T, can we determine if either \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( Lp(z) \\\\), or both were applied at any point up to T only by analyzing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from numerous combinations of the application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( Lp(z) \\\\), along with the intrinsic evolution of z under operator \\\\( L \\\\). The transformations contribute in varying degrees depending on their parameters and timing, leading to indeterminable causal paths just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The second derivative of z with respect to time minus az directly influences z(t), while the Fourier transform of z results in z(ω), representing z in frequency domain."
