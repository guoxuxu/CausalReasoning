  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, and \\\\(f\\\\) is holomorphic. We transform this function using the Laplace transform on the real part and the Fourier transform on the imaginary part, denoted as \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Re(f(x, y))\\\\}(s) + i\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{Im(f(x, y))\\\\}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) by a non-analytic function \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) at a certain point, will \\\\(F(s, \\\\omega)\\\\) simply reflect combined transformations of \\\\(f\\\\) and \\\\(g\\\\) independently?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\), being non-analytic, may introduce discontinuities or singularities that affect not only the original function but also how both the Laplace and Fourier transforms process these features. The transformation cannot then be viewed as merely superimposed or independent effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
