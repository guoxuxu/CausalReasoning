  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of the Laplace transform on this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nAfter obtaining the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), can we uniquely identify the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is uniquely determined by the pole of the Laplace transform at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\), which indicates the specific frequency used in the original function. No additional information is required to deduce \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the transform outcome.",
