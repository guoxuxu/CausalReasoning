  "Problem": "Evaluate the implication of the Laplace transform on the behavior of an electrical circuit described by the differential equation \\( L\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is inductance, \\( R \\) is resistance, and \\( V(t) \\) represents a time-varying voltage source. The transformation applied is \\( \\mathcal{L}(I(t)) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(V(t))}{sL + R} \\), and we analyze effects and causality with respect to this transform.\n\nBy observing the current \\( I(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we exactly determine \\( V(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) without prior knowledge of the behavior of \\( V(t) \\) during the interval \\( 0 \\) to \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without full interval data of \\( V(t) \\) or additional information about its form, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( I(t) \\) does not necessarily yield a unique \\( V(t) \\), as the transformation might lose specificity of the input conditions due to potential non-injective mappings.",
