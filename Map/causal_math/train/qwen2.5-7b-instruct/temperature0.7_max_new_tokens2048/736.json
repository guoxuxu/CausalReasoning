  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We study the implications of applying a transformation denoted by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on this system dynamics.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely identify the sequence or type of transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex nature of exponentials and compound transformations, different sequences of applications of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) can result in the same final observed state. This is because the effects of squaring or cubing the magnitude and angle can be synthesized in different ways to achieve the same endpoint, thus obfuscating the precise transformations applied throughout the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
