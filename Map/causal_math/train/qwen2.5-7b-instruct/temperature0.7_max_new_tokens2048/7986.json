  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\) and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the Fourier transformation defined by \\( F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\), where \\( \\omega \\) represents angular frequency.\n\nCan the original time-dependent function \\( z(t) \\) be uniquely determined from its Fourier transform \\( F(z(t)) \\) at specific \\( \\omega \\) values?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation is theoretically reversible under ideal conditions, meaning \\( z(t) \\) can be uniquely determined from \\( F(z(t)) \\) across all \\( \\omega \\). Thus, knowing the Fourier transform across a sufficient range of \\( \\omega \\) values allows for the reconstruction of \\( z(t) \\).",
