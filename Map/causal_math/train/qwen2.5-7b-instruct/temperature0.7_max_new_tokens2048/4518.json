  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain variable.\n\nIf the Fourier transform of z(t) shows an increased magnitude at \\\\( \\omega = 0 \\\\), can we infer that a constant value was added to z(t) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "An increase at \\\\( \\omega = 0 \\\\) in the Fourier transform directly signifies an added constant in the time domain. This increase corresponds to the integral of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, indicating a uniform shift.",
