  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} dt \\\\), where z is a complex number with a positive real part. We explore the impact of two transformations defined by the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) on the complex plane as \\\\( A(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( B(z) = z + 1 \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z \\\\) after calculating \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( B(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( B(z) = z + 1 \\\\), it is impossible to determine whether the increase by 1 occurred before evaluation, as the transformation shifts the complex plane, potentially altering the exponential decay and thus, the integral outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
