  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where x is a fixed complex number, and A is a complex constant. We investigate the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after applying the integral transformation \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves from initial point \\\\( x \\\\) according to the function \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at any time t be different from just integrating \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\) from 0 to t?",
  "Explanation": "As the integral transformation \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is directly calculated from the output \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) without any modification, \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{As}x ds \\\\) directly corresponds to integrating the function over time t. There is no alteration in the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a consistent result.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( w(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\) is influenced by the integral of \\( z(s) \\) from 0 to \\( t \\), and since \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\), the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) from the initial point \\( x \\) through the function \\( e^{At} \\) directly determines the form of \\( w(t) \\).
