  "Problem": "In this system, we consider the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We will explore the consequences of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Ke^{Mt}z\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(M\\\\) is another diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIdentifying the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we conclusively specify which transformations were applied (either \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both) by only knowing the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Matrix interactions, especially with multiple transformations, create overlapping impacts leading to similar endpoints from different initial and intervention paths. The intricacies of how matrices \\\\(K\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(S\\\\), and \\\\(N\\\\) interact with \\\\(D\\\\) make it challenging to pinpoint specific transformations applied solely from observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(t) evolves over time t under the dynamics defined by D to become z(T). Applying the transformation g(z) = Ke^(Mt)z modifies z(t) to produce z(T). Knowing z(T) allows us to infer the effect of g(z) and M on z(t), but it is not sufficient to conclusively determine if h(z) was also applied without additional information."
