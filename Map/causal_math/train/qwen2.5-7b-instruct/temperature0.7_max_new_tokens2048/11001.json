  "Problem": "Consider a frequency analysis where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), leading to an output signal represented by the product \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform followed by processing through an LTI system, will \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) \\\\) be strictly governed by \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) without any external influences?",
  "Explanation": "Under the specified scenario without intervention, the output \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) \\\\) is determined directly and exclusively by the input and the system's characteristics. The transformation through \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) describes all modifications to \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), and no external factors alter this relationship in the given setup.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) transforms to X(ω) via Fourier transform, and then Y(ω) is determined by the product of X(ω) and H(ω) through the LTI system."
