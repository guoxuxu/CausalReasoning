  "Problem": "Consider a discrete-time system governed by the equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\\\), where \\\\( f(x) = A x \\\\) with A being a square matrix. We also use a linear operator \\\\( T(x) = B x \\\\), where B is another square matrix, to transform the initial state.\n\nGiven the system's state \\\\( x_N \\\\) at step N, can we infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( B \\\\) introduces an ambiguity. Without knowing whether \\\\( B \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x_N \\\\) as both \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( B x_0 \\\\) could potentially lead to observed states, depending upon their respective evolutions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state at the next time step x_N+1 is determined by the current state x_N through the transformation defined by matrix A. The initial state x_0 leads to subsequent states through successive applications of A. Applying the linear operator B transforms the initial state x_0 but does not affect the backward inference of x_0 from x_N without additional information."
