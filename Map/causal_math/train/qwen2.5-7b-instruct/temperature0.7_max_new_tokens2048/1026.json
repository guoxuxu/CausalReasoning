  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real function of time t and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\), with A being a real constant.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by analyzing the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(T) \\\\) includes the factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\), which affects the magnitude and phase of the output, we can determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by examining how the phase of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) changes relative to \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The real part of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is proportional to \\\\( \\\\cos(\\\\omega T) \\\\) and the imaginary part to \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega T) \\\\), thus allowing for the calculation of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) via an arc-tangent function.",
