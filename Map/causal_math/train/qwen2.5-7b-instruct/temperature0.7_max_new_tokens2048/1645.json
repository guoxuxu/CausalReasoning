  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We then apply a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, to the function at time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the function, which then evolves differently under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\). The presence of the exponential factor associated with B adds complexity and distinct characteristics to the evolution, resulting in a different outcome at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) to z_0 at t=0 and evolving it under ∂z/∂t = Az for time T results in the same z(t) as directly evolving z_0 under ∂z/∂t = Az for time T."
