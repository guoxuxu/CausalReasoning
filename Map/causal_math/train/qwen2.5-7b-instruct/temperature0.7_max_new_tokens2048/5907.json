  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyse how this function transforms under the operation of a complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} f(x) dx \\\\).\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( w(x) = e^{-2ix} \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at some point before applying \\\\( T \\\\), will the resultant transform \\\\( T[wz](s) \\\\) still produce a Dirac delta function at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( w(x) \\\\) changes the function to \\\\( wz(x) = e^{-ix} \\\\), whose Fourier transform or resultant under \\\\( T \\\\) will yield a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( s = -1 \\\\) rather than \\\\( s = 1 \\\\). The new function \\\\( wz(x) \\\\) shifts the frequency component, thereby altering the resultant transformed function.",
