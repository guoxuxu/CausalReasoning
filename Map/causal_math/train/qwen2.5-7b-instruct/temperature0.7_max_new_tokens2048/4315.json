  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and A, B, C, D are constants. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](s) \\\\) and its inverse on the dynamics of this system.\n\nIf a modulation by a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is introduced as an intervention during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will this affect the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), independent of whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the modulation function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) directly impacts the phase and frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) throughout its evolution. This modulation affects the final state by adding a frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to the system, irrespective of whether the initial state was Fourier transformed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
