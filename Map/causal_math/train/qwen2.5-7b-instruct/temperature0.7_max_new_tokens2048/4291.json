  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial conditions and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces an additional rotational factor, affecting the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Both the initial transformation with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) contribute to the final state through their respective impacts on the phase of the complex number, resulting in a dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), and the initial conditions.",
