  "Problem": "In this system, we consider the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We will explore the consequences of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Ke^{Mt}z\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(M\\\\) is another diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf at a given time \\\\(t_2\\\\), an intervention involving another transformation \\\\(h(z) = Se^{Nt}z\\\\) (where \\\\(S\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices) is enacted, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_2 be solely determined by \\\\(D\\\\), and not by \\\\(K\\\\) or \\\\(M\\\\) or \\\\(S\\\\) or \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an additional transformation as an intervention introduces new variables. The resulting state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) becomes influenced by the compounded effects of \\\\(K\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(S\\\\), and \\\\(N\\\\) alongside \\\\(D\\\\), each contributing to the trajectory and the ultimate position.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) is driven by D through the differential equation. g(z) and h(z) transform z(t) but their effects on z(T) are overshadowed by D due to the underlying dynamics defined by D."
