  "Problem": "Consider a functional system governed by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the alterations in system behavior by introducing an external control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) that modifies the integral operation.\n\nKnowing the final output from \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and knowing that an intervention modified \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at some point, can we determine what the intervention was (i.e., the form of \\\\( u(t) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The modification introduced by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and complex behavior of the integrals prevent us from precisely back-calculating the form of the intervention solely based on the function output due to potential many-to-one mappings and the integral transformations’ complexity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
