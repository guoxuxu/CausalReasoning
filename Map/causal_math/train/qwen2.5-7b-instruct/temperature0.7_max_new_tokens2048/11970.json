  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem associated with the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space. The operator is defined by the differential equation \\\\(L[u] = -y'' + q(x)y \\\\) on the interval \\\\([0, 1]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(y(0) = y(1) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q(x)\\\\) is a potential function.\n\nIf an external potential \\\\(p(x)\\\\) is introduced into the system after some eigenvalues \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are already calculated, will the subsequent eigenvalues only reflect the effects of \\\\(q(x)\\\\) rather than \\\\(p(x) + q(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an external potential modifies the entire eigenvalue spectrum, as the potential directly contributes to the differential operator. The new eigenvalues will reflect the composite effect of both \\\\(p(x)\\\\) and \\\\(q(x)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential functions q(x) and p(x) individually influence the eigenvalues λ, but introducing p(x) after calculating eigenvalues based on q(x) will change the eigenvalues to reflect the combined effect of p(x) + q(x)."
