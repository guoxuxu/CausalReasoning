  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the influence of Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing components of the complex signal over time t.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any loss of information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is invertible under suitable conditions (e.g., \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is sufficiently smooth and integrable), allowing the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to be recovered exactly from its transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier Transform of a complex function z(t) results in its frequency domain representation F(z(t)), which can be used to reconstruct z(t) if the transform is invertible, and both x(t) and y(t) contribute to defining z(t)."
