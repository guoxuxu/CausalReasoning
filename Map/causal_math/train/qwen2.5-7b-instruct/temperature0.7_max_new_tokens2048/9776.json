  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system that filters an input signal x(t) using a transfer function H(s). We examine how impulse response h(t), which is the inverse Laplace Transform of H(s), affects the output y(t) of the system.\n\nGiven the output y(T), can we determine precisely which impulse responses (original h(t) or modified h'(t)) were applied throughout the system's operation?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of input signals and impulse responses (both h(t) and h'(t) applied in varying sequences) could yield the same output y(T). This ambiguity prevents the precise determination of what specific impulse responses were applied during the system's operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
