  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature \\\\( T \\\\) affects the rate of a chemical reaction according to the Arrhenius equation, given by \\\\( R(T) = A e^{-\\\\frac{E}{RT}} \\\\), where \\\\( E \\\\) is the activation energy, \\\\( R \\\\) is the gas constant, and \\\\( A \\\\) is a pre-exponential factor. We need to also consider an intervention by adjusting the temperature profile over time with a function \\\\( f(t) = T_0 + kt \\\\), where \\\\( T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature and \\\\( k \\\\) is the rate of change of temperature.\n\nIf an intervention changes the temperature profile to \\\\( f(t) = T_1 + kt \\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the reaction rate \\\\( R(T) \\\\) at time t > t_1 only depend on the initial parameters (\\\\( T_0 \\\\), \\\\( k \\\\)) and not on \\\\( T_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the temperature profile, introducing \\\\( T_1 \\\\) as a new baseline temperature after \\\\( t_1 \\\\). This change impacts \\\\( R(T) \\\\) directly due to its dependency on \\\\( T \\\\), thus the reaction rate at times t > t_1 depends on the current temperature profile including \\\\( T_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature T directly influences the reaction rate R through the Arrhenius equation. Temperature T is determined by the initial temperature T_0 and the rate of change k. After time t_1, the temperature T is solely influenced by T_0, k, and time t, but the reaction rate R at any time t > t_1 depends only on the initial conditions T_0 and k, not on T_1."
