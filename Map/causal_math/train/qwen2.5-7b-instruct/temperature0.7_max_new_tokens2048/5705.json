  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field V(x) and analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax + b \\\\) where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We study the particle's motion in different cases with and without transformations using the operator \\\\( e^{Lt} \\\\), where L is the Liouville operator for the system.\n\nIf the initial position of the particle is transformed by \\\\( T(x) \\\\), and it moves according to Hamilton's equations without further intervention, will the particle's position at time T be the same as if it had started at the original position, following the same equations?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) alters the starting conditions of the particle's motion. Since \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies both position and potentially momentum (depending on A and b), the trajectory of the particle will differ from that starting from the original position, leading to a different position at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation T(x) to the initial position x results in a new position x', which then determines the particle's position at time T; if the particle starts at the original position without transformation, its position at time T would differ unless T(x) is the identity transformation."
