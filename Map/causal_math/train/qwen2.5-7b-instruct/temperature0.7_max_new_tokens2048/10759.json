  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a positive constant related to eigenvalues. The solution space is transformed via the Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\). The impact of computation methods such as numerical integration is also explored.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) by applying a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), such as differentiation with respect to x at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the modified state at any t > t_1 depend solely on the original transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), ignoring the effects of \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) changes the state of the system in a way that cannot be neglected. This manipulation can alter both the amplitude and phase of the components within the solution, resulting in a state at t > t_1 that reflects the impact of both \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), not just \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a differential operator D to u(x,t) results in u'(x,t), which then influences the state u(x,t> t1) through time evolution."
