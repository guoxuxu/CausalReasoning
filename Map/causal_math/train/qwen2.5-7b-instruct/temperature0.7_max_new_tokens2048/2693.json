  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a continuous time Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform of the same function. Let \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and let \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and Fourier transform \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) are applied to \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), will the resulting transforms provide the same functional outcome without further transformations?",
  "Explanation": "No, while both transforms may involve integral transformations of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), they generate different results due to their distinct integral kernels and domains (s-domain and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)-domain respectively). Fourier and Laplace transforms of a Gaussian function yield different expressions, hence different functional outcomes.",
