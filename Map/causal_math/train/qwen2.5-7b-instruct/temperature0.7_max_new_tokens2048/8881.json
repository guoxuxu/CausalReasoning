  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic economic model governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where x and u denote state and control vectors respectively, and A and B are constant matrices. We observe the effect of input changes via the transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = Cu \\\\) for some constant matrix C.\n\nIf the initial control vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) at time t = 0, will the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T evolve similarly to if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was applied directly without the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( g(u) = Cu \\\\) modifies the control input, which in turn changes the driving force in the system according to \\\\( Bu \\\\). Because the dynamics of the system depend linearly on u, altering u via C fundamentally changes the trajectory of x over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control vector u directly influences the state vector x, and through the transformation g(u), it indirectly influences x. Therefore, applying u directly has a different effect on x compared to applying u after the transformation g(u)."
