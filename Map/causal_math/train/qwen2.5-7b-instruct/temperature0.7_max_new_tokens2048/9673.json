  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of z. The initial state \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) undergoes a transformation via the operation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents a frequency of rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for any t = T strictly follow the path dictated by the initial function of \\\\( z \\\\) if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) fundamentally modifies the trajectory by imparting a rotational dynamic to the complex number. This rotation deviates from the natural growth or decay path that would be seen if the transformation were not applied, thus affecting the trajectory in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation g(z) at t=0 leads to the evolution of z(t) over time, with the initial state z_0 and the frequency ω determining the trajectory of z(t)."
