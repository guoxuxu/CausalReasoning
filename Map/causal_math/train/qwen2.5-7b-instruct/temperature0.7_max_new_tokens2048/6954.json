  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the integral transformation was applied, it is impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as the transformation involving \\\\( N \\\\) may have modified the trajectory significantly. This makes it indeterminate since the matrix \\\\( N \\\\) could introduce changes that cannot be easily reversed or discerned.",
