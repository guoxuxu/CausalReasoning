  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) over time t in the complex plane, and its response under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = kz \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the constant k after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge of whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation was applied, we cannot determine if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) has been scaled by k, as it inherently matches the form of the baseline function \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\), just potentially rescaled. Multiple values of k could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
