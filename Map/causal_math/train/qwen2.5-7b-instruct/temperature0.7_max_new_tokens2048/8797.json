  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) where A, B, C, and D are constants. We examine the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, on the solution of the system over time t.\n\nIf the initial conditions \\\\( z(0) = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) are transformed using the Laplace transform and then the inverse Laplace transform is applied, will the system solutions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T follow the same trajectory as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was evolved under the original differential equations without this transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse provide a way to solve the system of differential equations, but they do not change the trajectory or dynamics of the system itself. Applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse essentially reconstructs the original function without altering its behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
