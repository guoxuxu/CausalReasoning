  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex constant vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to this function over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original constant vector \\\\( w \\\\) after observing the Fourier transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) gives us the frequency components of the signal, which are shifted according to \\\\( A \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( A \\\\), it is impossible to accurately revert the frequency shift to recover \\\\( w \\\\) fully because the phase shift introduced by \\\\( A \\\\) in the transformation is undetermined.",
