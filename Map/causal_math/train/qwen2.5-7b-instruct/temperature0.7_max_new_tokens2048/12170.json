  "Problem": "Consider a calculation involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The calculation examines the integral transformation across time t defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\int_0^T z(t) \\, dt \\\\) and impacts of interventions at different stages.\n\nIf, midway through the interval, a phase shift of \\\\( \\pi/2 \\\\) radians is introduced to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), altering it to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i (\\omega t + \\pi/2)} \\\\) for the remaining half of the interval, will the result of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) still be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a phase shift midway through the evaluation affects the symmetry and the periodicity of the integral over the full interval. The first half and the second half of the integral now cover different phases of the sinusoidal function, not canceling each other out completely, leading to a non-zero result for \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing a phase shift of π/2 to z(t) in the second half of the interval changes the function from e^(i * ω * t) to e^(i * (ω * t + π/2)), which affects the value of F(z). Since the integral transformation F(z) = ∫_0^T z(t) dt includes the altered function for the second half of the interval, F(z) will not necessarily be zero."
