  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex number. This system is analyzed in terms of the impact of the Laplace transform on the evolution of this function over time.\n\nIf at some point t = t_1 a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant is applied as an intervention, will the system at time T depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system's evolution. The new function will affect the exponential growth or decay, making the state at time T additionally dependent on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
