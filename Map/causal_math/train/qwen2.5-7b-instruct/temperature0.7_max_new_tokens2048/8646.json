  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\( V(x, t) \\), such that \\( i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\\\\psi \\). We explore how applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi(x, t)) \\\\) affects the wave function over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original wave function \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of Fourier transform application, the transformation may have altered the wave function in momentum space, obscuring its original form in position space. This makes it challenging to precisely retrieve \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential function V(x, t) influences the wave function ψ(x, t), and the initial state ψ(x, 0) evolves over time to become ψ(x, T). Observing ψ(x, T) allows inference about ψ(x, 0) if the evolution is known."
