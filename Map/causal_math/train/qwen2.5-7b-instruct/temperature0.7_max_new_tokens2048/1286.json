  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over [0, T] solely from knowledge of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) aggregates information across the interval [0, T] in a way that is not simple to invert, especially without explicit knowledge of whether the transformation was applied. This means that multiple different functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result in the same result through \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), preventing a unique determination of the original function.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
