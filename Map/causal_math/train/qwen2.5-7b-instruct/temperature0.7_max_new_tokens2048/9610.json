  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices, and x is an initial condition vector. We examine the influence of the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, during different interventions over time t.\n\nAfter observing the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\), can we deduce the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without prior knowledge of specific values of C or D?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit values for C and D, the reconstruction of \\\\( x \\\\) from \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) is not feasible as multiple combinations of C, D, and x can yield the same transform. Knowing the matrices C and D is crucial for uniquely identifying the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
