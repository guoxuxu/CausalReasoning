  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We investigate the behavior of this system when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the end result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we accurately determine whether or not an intervention occurred altering \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without prior knowledge of system parameters or history?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) alone does not provide sufficient information to conclude definitively about the presence or absence of interventions such as changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The accumulation of effects through integration and lack of direct visibility into the instantaneous state at any time such as \\\\( t_1 \\\\) prevents backtracking to infer interventions accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z_0 and the real constant ω directly cause the value of z(t). The value of z(t) directly causes the integral transformation T[z](t), and the real constant ω also directly causes the value of T[z](t)."
