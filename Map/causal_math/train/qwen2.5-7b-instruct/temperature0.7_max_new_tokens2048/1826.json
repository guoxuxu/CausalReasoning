  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = a+bt+ict^2 \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants, and study the application of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact original values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) after observing the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without previous data about their values?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier Transform encodes all the information about the time-domain function, extracting exact values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) requires solving an inverse problem which may not be unique without additional constraints or knowledge about the phase and original conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
