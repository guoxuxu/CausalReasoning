  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nGiven the spectrum resulting from the Fourier Transform of a function, can we infer the exact time-domain representation of the signal specifically determined whether the signal was \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), assuming no prior information on phase or amplitude modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform provides the frequency components and their magnitudes but losses specific phase information unless specifically preserved. Multiple time-domain signals could have the same magnitude spectrum, making it impossible to uniquely determine the function \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without additional phase information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
