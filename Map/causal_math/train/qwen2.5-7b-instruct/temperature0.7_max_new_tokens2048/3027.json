  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). We examine how the system evolves with and without the application of \\\\( T \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, directly influencing subsequent behavior, would the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without accounting for the effects of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after the application of \\\\( T \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) would not only depend on the natural evolution but significantly on the accumulated effect resulting from the transformation \\\\( T \\\\). The intervention modifies the trajectory by integrating past states, which means it cannot solely depend on the continuous, thereafter unwanted evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T depends on the integral transformation T applied to z from 0 to T, which in turn is influenced by the natural evolution of z from 0 to T."
