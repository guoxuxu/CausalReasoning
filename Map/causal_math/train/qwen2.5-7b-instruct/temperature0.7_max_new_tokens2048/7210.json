  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of an electrical circuit where the resistance R(t) can change over time, and the voltage across the resistor V(t) is given by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = I(t) R(t) \\\\), where I(t) represents the current. We explore the cases under the transformation defined by multiplying the current by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(I) = e^{i\\omega t}I(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency.\n\nAfter observing the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(I) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(I) \\\\), and given that the voltage is a product of two time-varying variables (current and resistance), which includes a phase-altered current, we cannot uniquely determine the original state of \\\\( I_0 \\\\) from \\\\( V(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The resistance R(t) and current I(t) directly cause the voltage V(t). The transformation f(I) indirectly affects the current I(t), which in turn influences V(t). Knowing V(T) does not allow us to deduce I_0 without information about whether f(I) was applied."
