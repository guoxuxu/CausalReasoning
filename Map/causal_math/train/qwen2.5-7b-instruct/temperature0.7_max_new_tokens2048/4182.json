  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), and a response function described by \\\\( R(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p} \\\\) where p is a positive constant. The system's output is obtained by the convolution operation in the time domain corresponding to multiplication in the Laplace domain. We study the influence of a feedback mechanism introduced via a transformation \\\\( g(y) = e^{-kt}y \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf observing the output \\\\( Y(T) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we determine if the initial function was precisely \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) without knowing whether any intervention like \\\\( g(y) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about the intermediate transformations (like \\\\( g(y) \\\\) or others) means we cannot clearly trace back the exact initial function \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) from the output \\\\( Y(T) \\\\), as transformations such as \\\\( g(y) = e^{-kt}y \\\\) could modify the frequency and decay characteristics encoded by \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the feedback mechanism g(y) transforms the output Y(s) into Y(T), potentially altering the observed output Y(T) from its original state Y(s)."
