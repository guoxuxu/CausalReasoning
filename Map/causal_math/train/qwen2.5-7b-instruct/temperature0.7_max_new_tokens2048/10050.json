  "Problem": "In a study of fluid dynamics, let \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid on a plane, subject to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\). We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed field \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, T) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the initial field \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) using an inverse Fourier transform without knowing the specific initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform reconstructs the spatial structure at time T, but losses about phases or certain harmonic components altered by the dynamics might prevent accurate reversion to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), unless very specific properties of the PDE are met.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The velocity field u(x, t) influences its time derivative ∂u/∂t and spatial derivative ∂u/∂x; the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t + u ∂u/∂x = 0 holds; applying the Fourier transform to u(x, t) yields F(u)(k, t), which remains F(u)(k, T) at time T; using the inverse Fourier transform on F(u)(k, T) allows reconstruction of u(x, 0) without needing the specific initial conditions."
