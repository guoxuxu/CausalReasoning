  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving under the influence of a potential field governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\). The potential field is perturbed by an added magnetic field, described by a vector potential \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\). The effect of \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) is represented through the transformation \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t) = \\\\vec{A} \\\\times \\\\vec{x}\\\\) at time t.\n\nCan we reverse-engineer the initial position and velocity of the particle at t = 0 after observing it at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without exact knowledge of the application of \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t)\\\\), the trajectory could be one of an infinite number given different potential magnetic perturbations. The cross product interaction between \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\vec{x}\\\\) obscures the initial conditions from being uniquely reconstructed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
