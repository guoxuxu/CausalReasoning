  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. An integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to study its properties over time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven the final observation \\( z(T) \\), can we determine specifically whether the transformation \\( T(z) \\) or the intervention \\( P(z) \\) was applied, based solely on \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "From \\( z(T) \\) alone, it is not possible to disentangle the effects or even the presence of \\( T(z) \\) versus \\( P(z) \\). The trajectories leading to \\( z(T) \\) could be achieved by a variety of combinations of \\( c \\) and \\( T(z) \\), without a unique traceable path.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω influences the function z(t) over time t, which in turn determines z(T) through the integral transformation T(z). The transformation T(z) directly results in z(T)."
