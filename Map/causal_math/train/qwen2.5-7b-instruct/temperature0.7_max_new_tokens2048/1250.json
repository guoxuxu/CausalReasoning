  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with constant coefficients A, B, C, D. An integral transformation defined by \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) dt\\\\) releases a transformed state over a variable S.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed state \\\\(f(z)(T)\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was or wasn’t applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the integral transformation was applied, determining the original function just from the transformed endpoint is infeasible. The transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) fundamentally changes the trajectory in a way that is not immediately inferable from the endpoint alone due to the irreversible nature of integral operations.",
