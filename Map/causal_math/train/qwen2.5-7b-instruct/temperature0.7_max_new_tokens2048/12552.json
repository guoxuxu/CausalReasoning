  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ixt}u(t)dt \\\\) on the function u over time t.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) is transformed via \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without any further modification, will the function u(t) at t = T be equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the initial conditions by transforming the function into the frequency domain, thereby changing the characteristics and subsequent evolution of the system. The solution path of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) will differ as a result of these initial modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
