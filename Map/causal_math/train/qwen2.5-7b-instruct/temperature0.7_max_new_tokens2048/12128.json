  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a set of coupled differential equations. Analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( u(s) \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nIf \\\\( u(s) \\\\) is applied across the interval [0,T], and then the system is allowed to evolve with its inherent dynamics from T to T1 without further intervention, will the complex state \\\\( z(T1) \\\\) be the same as if the system had evolved from 0 to T1 without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( u(s) \\\\) adds a specific integral change to the state over the time from 0 to T, manipulating the trajectory from its natural path. The subsequent evolution can start off from a significantly altered initial condition at T, affecting the final state at T1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of u(s) over [0,T] influences z(t) which in turn determines z(T1). If u(s) is not applied from 0 to T1, the evolution of z(T1) would differ due to the initial conditions set by the integral transformation."
