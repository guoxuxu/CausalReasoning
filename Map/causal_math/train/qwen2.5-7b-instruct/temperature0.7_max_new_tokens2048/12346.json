  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform on the function, defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf during the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), an impulse function \\\\( \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\) is added at a certain time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will this intervention affect the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the impulse function \\\\( \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\) introduces a new element into \\\\(z(t)\\\\), specifically adding a spike at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\). This alteration translates to a change in the Fourier Transform, specifically, adding a term \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega t_0} \\\\) that shifts the phases in the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
