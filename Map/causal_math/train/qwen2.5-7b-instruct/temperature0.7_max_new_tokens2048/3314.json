  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is an analytic solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Pz \\\\), where P is a linear operator. Evaluate how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) influences the system's behavior.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing if the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) was ever computed, can you retrospectively determine the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t < T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The computation of the Fourier transform does not affect the system's state and serves only as an analysis tool. Thus, knowing whether it was computed provides no additional information about the system's state evolution prior to time \\\\( T \\\\), which is dictated solely by the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator P influences z(t) through the partial differential equation, which in turn determines the state of z(t) at any time t and z(T). The Fourier transform F(z) of z(t) is related to z(t) and also influences the partial differential equation governing the change in z(t) over time."
