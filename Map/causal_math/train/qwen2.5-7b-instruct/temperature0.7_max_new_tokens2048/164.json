  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) in a two-dimensional space. We inquire about the impacts via transformations represented by \\\\( g(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) and subsequent linear transformations \\\\( h(x, y) = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the transformations used (both \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\)) by only observing the final value of \\\\( z \\\\) and knowing the original point \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same final value of \\\\( z \\\\) could potentially result from different transformation parameters due to the non-identification problem and the non-inversive nature of combining transformations like exponentials and matrix multiplications. Thus, it's impossible to uniquely identify the sequence or parameters of transformations just from the final value of \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial values x0 and y0 directly cause x and y through the transformation g, which then directly cause z through the function f. Therefore, x0 and y0 directly cause z."
