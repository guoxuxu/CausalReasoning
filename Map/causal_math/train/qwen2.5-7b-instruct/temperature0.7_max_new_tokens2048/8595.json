  "Problem": "Consider the impact of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) and how it behaves when inverse transformed under different modifications.\n\nIf the Laplace-transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is modified by multiplying with \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) and then inverse transformed, will the resulting function in the time domain represent \\\\( \\\\int_0^t g(u) du \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) in the frequency domain corresponds to integration in the time domain. Thus, transforming \\\\( G(s) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) back will yield the integral of the original function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) over time, from 0 to t.",
