  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the equation \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where x and y are real variables, and i is the imaginary unit. This system is subjected to the transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of the system is analyzed in a scenario where transformations are applied and the system evolves over time.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of another function \\\\( H(z) = e^{Mz} \\\\) (where M is another constant complex matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the system's state at T > t_1 depend solely on the matrix K and not on the matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( H(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory initiated by \\\\( G(z) \\\\), and thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) also depends on M. The interactions between the transformations due to K and M are complex and not merely additive, leading to a dependency on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
