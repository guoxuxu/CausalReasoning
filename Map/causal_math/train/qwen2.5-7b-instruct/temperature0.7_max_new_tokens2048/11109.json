  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\dot{u} = Ku\\\\), with K being a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Lt}z \\\\) (where L is a constant matrix) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\dot{u} = Ku \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\dot{u} = Ku \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition of the system, as \\\\( e^{Lt} \\\\) modifies the magnitude and phase components of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). These changes affect how \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) interacts with \\\\( u(t) \\\\), thus the trajectory of the system is altered, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Ku\\\\) leads to z(t) at any time t, which is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Ku\\\\) to t=T through u(t). The matrix L governs the transformation of z while K dictates the evolution of u."
