  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency. We assess the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega s}f(s)ds \\\\) over an interval.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( T[S[z]](T) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we definitively determine the sequence of transformations (whether \\\\( S \\\\) then \\\\( T \\\\), or just \\\\( T \\\\), or others) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) only by knowing the function value at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The variances in potential transformations like \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) involving different frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) make the specific determination of what transformations were applied based on final state ambiguous. Multiple combinations could yield the same outcome due to the integral effects and frequency overlaps, obfuscating the sequence of transformations based solely on endpoint observation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is transformed by T and possibly modified by S before applying T again, resulting in T[S[z]](T). Both S[z(t)] and T are causal steps leading to T[S[z]](T)."
