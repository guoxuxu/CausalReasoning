  "Problem": "Analyze a system given by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\), and consider the effect of applying a boundary condition transformation represented by \\\\( u = h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a harmonic function.\n\nIf a different harmonic function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied as a new boundary condition at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\), will the internal solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely reflect the changes due to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though a new boundary condition \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at any time T > t_1 will depend on both the previous condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and the new condition \\\\( g(x) \\\\), due to the superposition principle in linear systems and the memory of the earlier state's influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the harmonic function h(x) as a boundary condition leads to a specific internal solution u(x, T). Applying a different harmonic function g(x) as a new boundary condition at time t_1 results in a new internal solution u(x, T) that reflects only the changes due to g(x), independent of h(x)."
