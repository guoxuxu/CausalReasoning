  "Problem": "We consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real variable and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex number. The function is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) along with the application of a scaling and phase shift operation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{a+ib}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be reached by various combinations of phase shifts and scalings due to the additive and multiplicative nature of the operations. Without additional information, the precise historical sequence and type of interventions cannot be uniquely identified from the final value alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time t influences z(t) through the rate of change determined by ω. z(t) evolves over time to become z(T). h(z) modifies z(t) via scaling and phase shift, influenced by constants a and b. z(T) indicates the outcome which can suggest the application of h(z) but cannot definitively determine whether g(z) was also applied without additional information."
