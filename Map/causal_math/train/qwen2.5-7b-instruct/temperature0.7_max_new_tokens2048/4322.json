  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being different constant matrices. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the application of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) from 0 to t=T necessarily allow us to deduce both initial functions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) upon observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) changes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex way dependent on the interplay of A, B, and C. Given only \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the mixing of variables and potential non-invertibility of the transformation under general conditions obscures the true initial conditions.",
