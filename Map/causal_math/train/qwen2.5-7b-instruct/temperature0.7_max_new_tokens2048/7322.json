  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation in one dimension described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) is observed at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately deduce the original distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\), it is impossible to determine if the observed distribution at time \\\\( T \\\\) resulted from an exponentially scaled initial condition or not, especially since the scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) could significantly alter the evolution path of the distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
