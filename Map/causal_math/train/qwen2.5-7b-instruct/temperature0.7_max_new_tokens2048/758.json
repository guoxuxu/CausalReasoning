  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\), and a transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. This transformation represents an integral transformation affecting the signal over time.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed at time \\\\( T \\\\), can one uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) integrates a modified state over time, which affects the initial state and its evolution. Without knowing whether this transformation was applied, it is not possible to uniquely backtrack to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as multiple initial conditions could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the effects of \\\\( h(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0 directly influences z(t), which is then transformed by h(z) to produce z(T). The application of the linear differential operator L affects the evolution of z(t) over time, and the transformation h(z) modifies z(t) to result in z(T). Knowing z(T) alone is insufficient to uniquely determine z_0 without information on the transformation h(z) and the effect of L."
