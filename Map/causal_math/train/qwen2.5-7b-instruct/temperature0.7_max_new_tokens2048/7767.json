  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), transforming it into the frequency domain as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by modifying the operator to \\\\( M \\\\) in the spatial domain, and we observe \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), will the effect at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the initial operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing the operator to \\\\( M \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the system dynamics henceforth, thus making the resulting state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial conditions manipulated by \\\\( L \\\\) and the intervention with \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "L → u(x, t); L → ∂u/∂t; M → u(x, t); F(u(x, t)) → hat{u}(k, t); L → hat{u}(k, t); M → hat{u}(k, t); t_1 → M; t_1 → hat{u}(k, T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The operator L directly influences u(x, t) and its Fourier transform hat{u}(k, t). The intervention M modifies u(x, t) starting from time t_1, which then affects hat{u}(k, t) for times T > t_1. The effect at time T depends on both the initial operator L and the intervention M."
