  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) is applied to a complex variable z, where A is a complex constant. The effect of this transformation over time, modeled by \\\\( z(t) = f(z(t-1)) \\\\\\), is assessed with and without interventions.\n\nAfter observing the spiral pattern of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the exact times and types of interventions (function changes from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or others) be determined solely based on the trajectory up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The precise interventions cannot be determined from just the end-state spiral pattern, as different intervention timings and parameters (B, C, etc.) could result in visually similar patterns. Without knowing specific timings and transformation functions, multiple combinations of interventions could lead to the same observed pattern at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t-1 directly influences the value of z at time t through the transformation function f; the observed value of z at time T depends on the sequence of transformations applied from initial z to time T, which may include switching to other functions like g."
