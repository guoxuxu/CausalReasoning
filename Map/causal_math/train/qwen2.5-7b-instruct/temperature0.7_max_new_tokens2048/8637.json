  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing a circular trajectory in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of a transformation implemented by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t and its effects on the system.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any further transformations, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at t = 0 squares the initial radius and doubles the initial angle, significantly altering the trajectory and ending point after evolution to time T. The modification in the trajectory arises due to the change in both magnitude and phase introduced by the squaring function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial point z_0 directly causes z(T) through the evolution under z(t) = re^(iωt), and z_0^2 directly causes z(T) through the transformation f(z) = z^2 followed by the evolution under z(t) = re^(iωt)."
