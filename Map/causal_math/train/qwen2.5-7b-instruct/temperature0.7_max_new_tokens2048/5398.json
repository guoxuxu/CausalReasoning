  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. The effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, is investigated.\n\nIs it possible to reconstruct the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without confirmation whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to backtrack uniquely to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) might have altered the initial conditions in irrecoverable ways, especially if matrices Q and P do not share special properties like commutativity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
