  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of replacing a matrix A in a linear system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) with a new matrix \\\\(A' = A + B\\\\), where B introduces a perturbation. Let the initial condition be \\\\(x_0\\\\) and consider the effect of operator \\\\(f(x) = e^{Bt}x\\\\) over time.\n\nCan we discern the specific nature of the interventions (whether adjustment was made to A or B was introduced as a perturbation) solely based on observation of \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at endpoint T?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), the specific alterations to the system — be it through A or through an introduced B — cannot be distinctly identified because of the intertwined effects that can manifest similar dynamical outcomes. The result is therefore ambiguous regarding the nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
