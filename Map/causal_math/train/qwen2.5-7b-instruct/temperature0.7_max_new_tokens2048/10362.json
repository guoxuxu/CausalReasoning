  "Problem": "Imagine a continuous system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) as a transformation that acts on the state variable u.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowledge of the application of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirming whether the Fourier transformation was applied, the phase and frequency modulation introduced by \\\\( F(u) \\\\) could render it infeasible to infer the exact form of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), given the transform's impact on the signal's spectral components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of the function u at time T (u(x,T)) causally influences its initial state u_0(x) through the evolution operator L over time. The linear differential operator L transforms the initial state u_0(x) into the state u(x,t) at any time t, and the Fourier transform F(u) converts u into its frequency domain representation hat{u}, which is not necessary for determining u_0 from u(T)."
