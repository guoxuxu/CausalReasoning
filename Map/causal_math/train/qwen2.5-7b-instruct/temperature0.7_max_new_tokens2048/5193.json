  "Problem": "Consider a vector-valued function z(t) defined in a complex domain and governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), where M is a 2x2 matrix. An integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Mt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied. The transformation is modified by a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\) without additional transformations, will \\( T(z)(t) \\) at t = T be equivalent to directly computing \\( T(z)(t) \\) from \\( z_0 \\) without applying \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( f(z) \\) alters the initial vector by a phase factor which scales and rotates the vector in the complex plane. This modification affects how the vector evolves over time under \\( M \\) and subsequently changes the results of the integral transformation \\( T(z) \\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time (Mz → dz/dt). The initial condition z(0) determines the value of z at any time t (z(0) → z(t)). Applying the function f(z) modifies z(t) (f(z) → z(t)), which in turn affects the computation of T(z)(t) (z(t) → T(z)(t))."
