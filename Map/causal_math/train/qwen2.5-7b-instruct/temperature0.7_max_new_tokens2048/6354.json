  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix, applied at different times.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was initially applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the potential changes introduced by the C matrix. The transformation could affect the magnitude and phase of the initial vector, altering the trajectory unpredictably in the absence of this knowledge.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
