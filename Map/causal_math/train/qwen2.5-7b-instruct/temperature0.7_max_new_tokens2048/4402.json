  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = -v \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = u + \\\\alpha v \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant. We also consider the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed function \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it is impossible to trace back the transformed function to its original form due to the direct influence of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) on the system's dynamics, which affects both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), changing the behavior of the transformed function over time.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of z, z(0), is determined by the inverse Laplace transform of L(z(T)), with u(t) influencing v'(t) and v(t) influencing -u'(t), while α affects the rates of change of both u(t) and v(t)."
