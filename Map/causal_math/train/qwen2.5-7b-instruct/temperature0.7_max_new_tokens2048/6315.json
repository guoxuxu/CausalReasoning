  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applies an additional Fourier Transform with a different frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) at time t = t1, will the system at T > t1 remain solely influenced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without effects from \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a transform with a different frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) modifies the system's description by changing the spectral content of the solution. This results in a state not solely describable by the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but perturbed by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), thus affecting the endpoint at t = T greater than t1.",
