  "Problem": "In the context of a heat conduction problem, assume a rod along the x-axis where the temperature distribution at time t is given by the function \\( u(x,t) \\), which satisfies the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\). We consider an integral transformation \\( f(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-sx}u(x,0) \\, dx \\) (Fourier Transform) and study its impact on the solution when applied initially.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a different transformation \\( g(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-px}u(x,0) \\, dx \\) (another Fourier Transform with different parameter p) is conducted at \\( t_1 \\), will the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the heat conduction rate \\( k \\) and not on the transformations \\( f(u) \\) or \\( g(u) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( g(u) \\) modifies the evolving function by a substantial architecture shift due to the integral operation with a different parameter \\( p \\). Both \\( f(u) \\) and \\( g(u) \\) influence the development of the temperature profile, thus affecting the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) directly influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) at any later time t. The Fourier transforms f(u) and g(u) do not directly cause changes in u(x,t) after the initial condition, but they represent different ways of transforming the initial condition, which ultimately affects u(x,t) through the initial condition."
