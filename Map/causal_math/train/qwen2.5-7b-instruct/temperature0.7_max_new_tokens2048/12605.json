  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\), where C is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where D is a linear operator and S is an invertible matrix, over time t.\n\nCan we pinpoint the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after examining \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T if we don't know whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and lacking knowledge of S, D, and their relationship to C, it's challenging to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformations introduced by \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Dt}S \\\\) could significantly alter the initial conditions, masking the original state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)) directly causes the value of z at a later time (z(t+dt)). Applying the transformation h(z) directly causes the value of z at time t. The initial value of z at t=0 directly causes the value of z at t=T."
