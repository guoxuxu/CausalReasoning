  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of the function \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}dsB \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices. The system dynamics are investigated in relation to the Henstock-Kurzweil integral of the operator exponential, and its effect when applied as a transformation on a vector \\( x_0 \\).\n\nIf an intervention using a new function \\( w(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sC}dsD \\) (where \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are constant matrices) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\), does the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on the properties of \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\), \\( C \\), or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention \\( w(t) \\) adds another layer of complexity, integrating influences from matrices \\( C \\) and \\( D \\). This makes the final state \\( x(T) \\) a product not only of the original matrix \\( A \\) but also significantly influenced by \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\). Thus, the endpoint is a result of an interwoven effect of these matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state x(T) depends on the integral function z(t) which is influenced by matrices A and B, and also on the integral function w(t) which is influenced by matrices C and D. For T > t1, if w(t) is applied at t1, x(T) will be affected by both z(t) and w(t), meaning it depends on A, B, C, and D."
