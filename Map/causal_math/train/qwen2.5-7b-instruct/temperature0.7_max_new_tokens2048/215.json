  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAssuming an intervention is performed by applying a new transformation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where \\\\(D\\\\) is another complex constant) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the dynamics defined by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the system's trajectory based on the exponential effects of \\\\(D\\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will reflect influences from A, B, C, and especially D. The interactions of these constants significantly impact the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The dynamics defined by A and B determine x(t) and y(t), respectively; applying the transformation g(z) = e^(Dt)z at t_1 modifies z(t) but does not change the underlying dynamics of A and B; thus, the end state z(T) for T > t_1 depends on the initial conditions and the dynamics defined by A and B."
