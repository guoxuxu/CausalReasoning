  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze the effect of an initial condition transformed by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the starting condition of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Nt}x \\\\) modifies the trajectory depending on the interaction between the matrices M and N, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) would generally be different unless M and N are specifically related (e.g., commute).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(x0) → x(t); x0 → x(t); Mx → dx/dt; Nt → e^(Nt)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(x0) to the initial condition x0 at t=0 changes the state of the system such that it evolves differently under the differential equation Mx → dx/dt compared to evolving x0 directly under the same equation. The factor e^(Nt) modifies the evolution rate but does not preserve the initial condition's direct effect on the state at t=T."
