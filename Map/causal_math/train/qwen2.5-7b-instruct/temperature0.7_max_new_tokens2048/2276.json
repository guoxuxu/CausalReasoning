  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. This function models the summative effects of two evolving systems on a complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to uniquely identify if an intervention on \\\\( y \\\\) occurred and what its nature was (such as \\\\( y' \\\\) or \\\\( y'' \\\\)), solely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) and possible interventions contribute to \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of interventions and initial conditions. Therefore, it's not possible to pinpoint a specific intervention or the original or intermediate states of \\\\( y \\\\) based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T is influenced by both x and y. An intervention on y could change z, but without additional information about the initial conditions or the matrices A and B, it is not possible to uniquely determine the nature of the intervention on y."
