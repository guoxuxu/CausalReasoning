  "Problem": "A complex line integral is evaluated along different paths in a complex domain. The function is \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and the integral paths are circles centered at 0 with varying radii. We explore the impact of modifications to the path (change in the radius).\n\nKnowing the integral result was \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\) along a circular path, can we precisely determine if any interventions (changes in the radius) occurred, assuming the final state was a path enclosing z=0?",
  "Explanation": "Since any radius change around the pole at z=0 results in the same integral value of \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\), we cannot conclusively determine if any radius adjustments (interventions) were made solely based on the integral outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
