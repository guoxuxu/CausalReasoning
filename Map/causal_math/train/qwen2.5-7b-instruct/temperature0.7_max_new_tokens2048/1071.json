  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position components in a temporal dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with A and B being complex numbers.\n\nSuppose an intervention replaces B with a new constant \\\\( B' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the initial B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing B to B' alters the driving term in the differential equation. Hence, the system's subsequent path and the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) rely on both the initial trajectory influenced by B and the later trajectory dictated by B', making the endpoint dependent on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Intervening B with B' at time t_1 will affect z(t) for T > t_1, thus z(T) is not independent of the initial B."
