  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\). We evaluate the use of an exponential transformation defined by the function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\), where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) \\) modifies the initial state, and the nature of the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) heavily depends on initial conditions. The transformation \\( e^{Ct} \\) multiplies the initial state by a factor that evolves exponentially, resulting in a fundamentally different trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
