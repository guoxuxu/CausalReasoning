  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied on the complex plane excludes zero and analyze its impact using a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[f(t)](s) \\\\).\n\nBased on the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we infer the original function was \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) on the complex plane, especially around zero?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) uniquely determines the function due to the specific way singularities (like poles and essential singularities) manifest in the transform, thus allowing us to infer back to the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
