  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. This system undergoes an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x t} f(t) dt \\\\), and we explore the influence of this transformation on the system's behavior.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely identify whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( R \\\\), or both were applied to the system, only based on the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformations' ability to alter frequency content and their possible overlapping effects, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone doesn't provide enough information to distinguish between the applications of \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( R \\\\), or both. This stems from the integral transformations' inherent property of modifying the spectral components in non-reversible and non-unique ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(t) evolves over time to become z(T), and applying the integral transformation T[f](x) to the function z(t) results in the state z(T)."
