  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a variable transformation using a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) on the integration path in the complex plane. Given a continuous function g(z), we examine the integral transformation from the function \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over a specific path P to \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over the same path.\n\nCan the original integral \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over path P be recovered accurately after observing only the transformed integral \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) without knowing the function f?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to revert \\\\( g(f(z))f'(z) \\\\) accurately to \\\\( g(z) \\\\) since different transformations could yield similar changes in integration outcomes, obscuring the original function and path characteristics.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation function f(z) changes g(z) to g(f(z)), and the derivative f'(z) scales this change. Consequently, the integral of g(f(z))f'(z) over path P reflects the original integral of g(z) over P."
