  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system using the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the position and \\\\( t \\\\) is the time. The function evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. An initial wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) undergoes the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) = \\\\int K(x, s) \\\\psi_0(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nCan we determine precisely what transformations (whether \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\), \\\\( L(x, s) \\\\), or both) were applied based solely on the observed state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the same observed endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\), various combinations of transformations with \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) and \\\\( L(x, s) \\\\) could yield similar or identical results due to the complex interplay and interference patterns in wave functions. This makes it impossible to uniquely determine the applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
