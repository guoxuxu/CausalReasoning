  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\right) + q(x)y = \\\\lambda w(x)y \\\\), where \\\\( p(x), q(x), w(x) \\\\) are given functions and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is the eigenvalue. An integral transformation \\\\( T[y](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} k(x, t)y(t)dt \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nGiven the observed function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original function before applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation, generally speaking, does not guarantee invertibility without specific conditions on the kernel \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\). Without knowing these properties or having additional information about the initial conditions, reconstructing the original function is ambiguous.",
