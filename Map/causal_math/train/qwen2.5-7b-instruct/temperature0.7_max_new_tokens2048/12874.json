  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), representing a complex variable where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real numbers. We now explore the implications of the Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nAssuming an intervention where a scaling factor \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) (a constant real number) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before computing the Laplace transform, will the resultant transformation \\\\(F(s)\\\\) indicate the presence of the original function modified by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(\\\\alpha z(t)\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\alpha F(s)\\\\), linearly scaled by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\). Hence, the resultant Laplace transform still conserves the modified characteristics of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by reflecting the intervention of the scaling factor.",
