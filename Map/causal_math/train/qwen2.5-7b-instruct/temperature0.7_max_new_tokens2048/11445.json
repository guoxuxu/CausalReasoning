  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nIf the mapping function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves according to its natural law \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), will the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to T without the mapping?",
  "Explanation": "The mapping function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) modifies the initial phase of the oscillator, which affects its trajectory. Since phase is critical in determining the exact position of a harmonic oscillator, the resulting position will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the mapping function g(x) to the initial condition x_0, influenced by the phase constant θ, results in a transformed position x(t) that, when evolved under the natural law defined by ω, leads to a position x(T) at time T, which is equivalent to directly evolving x_0 to T without the mapping, due to the periodic nature of the exponential phase factor."
