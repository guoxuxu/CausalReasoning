  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az + B} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants. The model investigates the impact of the linear transformation and the complex function on a vector space over a field of complex numbers.\n\nCan the initial configuration or the series of transformations (\\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and \\\\( f(z) \\\\)) be deduced from the final vector alone, assuming all transformations potentially alter the vector?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the interactions between the linear transformations and the complex function, which can significantly alter and complexify the vector space, it is generally impractical to uniquely determine the sequence and type of transformations from the final vector alone. Nonlinear interactions and non-commutativity play roles in obscuring the causative path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
