  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor R and an inductor L in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(V(t)\\\\) denotes the applied voltage. We introduce a transformation \\\\(g(I) = I + ct\\\\), where c is a constant, applied to the current I at time t.\n\nIf an additional voltage source \\\\(V'(t) = kt\\\\), where k is a constant, is added at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention, will the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) only depend on the parameters R and L and not on the functions g or the added voltage term k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with an additional linearly increasing voltage source introduces another modifying factor to the original system equation. This additional term affects the differential equation's solution from time \\\\(t_1\\\\) onwards, making the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) dependent on the terms associated with \\\\(g(I)\\\\), R, L, as well as the parameters k and t.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The applied voltage V(t) and the initial conditions (including the transformation g and the intervention V'(t) at t_1) directly influence the current I through the resistive and inductive elements represented by R and L. Therefore, the final current I(T) depends on R, L, and the specific values of V(t), V'(t), and t_1."
