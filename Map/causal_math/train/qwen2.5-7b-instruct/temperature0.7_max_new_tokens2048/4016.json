  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which is the solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} \\\\), describing heat conduction. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, is applied to \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) to analyze its behavior under different conditions.\n\nCan we pinpoint which specific intervention (change in boundary condition or addition of a heat source) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), based on the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) encodes changes in a way that does not allow distinguishing between different types of interventions or their specifics due to the general loss of spatial details and similar impacts on the state from different interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
