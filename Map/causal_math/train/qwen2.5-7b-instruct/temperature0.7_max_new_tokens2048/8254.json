  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The effect of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\), is applied to analyze the frequency components of z(t).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed signal \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the initial condition z(0) and the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used in z(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform gives information on the frequency components, but the phase and the original amplitude of z(0) are lost in this transformation. Only the magnitude and frequency can be determined, not the complete initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω dictates the rate of change of z(t) with respect to time, z(t) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce F(z)(ω), which contains information about ω but does not directly specify z(0); F(z)(ω) contains information about ω but cannot uniquely determine z(0) without additional constraints."
