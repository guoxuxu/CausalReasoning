  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) applied to the function u(t, x) and investigate its evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) and then applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of the Fourier transform with linear differential operators, the transformation commutes with the evolution operator. The Fourier transform of the evolved function is the same as the evolution of the Fourier transform of the initial function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(t_0, x) directly influences the state u(t, x) at later times through the evolution governed by ∂u/∂t = Lu. Applying the Fourier transform F to u(t_0, x) directly results in F(u(t_0, x)), and this transformation influences the evolved state F(u(t, x)) which is the Fourier transform of u(t, x). Thus, applying F to u(t_0, x) before or after evolution under ∂u/∂t = Lu yields equivalent results."
