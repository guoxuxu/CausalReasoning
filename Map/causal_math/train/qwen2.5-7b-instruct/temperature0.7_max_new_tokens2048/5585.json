  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx}u(x, t)\\\\, dx \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 and subsequently evolved under \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to t = T and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution of the wave equation \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\) remains consistent under evolution without intervention. This invariance results from the transformation accurately representing the wave dynamics in the frequency domain, where the shift in frequencies due to the wave equation directly mirrors transformation over time.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u(x, 0) directly influences u(x, t) through the PDE u_t + Au_x = 0, which also directly influences the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\). Applying the Fourier transform to u(x, 0) at t=0 and evolving it under the PDE yields the same result as evolving u(x, 0) to t=T and then applying the Fourier transform."
