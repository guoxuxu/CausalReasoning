  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect over a region in the complex plane. Let \\\\( z \\\\) undergo a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) and analyze the transformation of the region under this function.\n\nCan we deduce the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly from the transformed point \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformation \\\\( f(g(z_0)) = \\\\frac{1}{z_0^2} \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( -z_0 \\\\) will provide the same result due to the squaring operation. This introduces an ambiguity in recovering the original point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
