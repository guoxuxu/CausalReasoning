  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and i is the imaginary unit. We study the influence of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nAfter observing the transformed output \\\\( f(z)(t) \\\\) at time T, can we exactly reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) up to time T without any knowledge whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) incorporates the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) which blends the influence of time evolution of z, making it impossible to uniquely deduce the function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) up to T only from the output \\\\( f(z)(t) \\\\) due to irreversible integration and possible many-to-one mappings.",
