  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_x^2 u \\\\), where D represents a diffusion constant. We also consider the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a wave number.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T(u)(x, T) \\\\) observed at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we recover the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovery of the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( T(u)(x, T) \\\\) is not feasible without precise knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\). The transformation effect due to \\\\( T(u) \\\\) on the evolution under the PDE can be intricate, involving Fourier components that may not readily reveal the exact initial state unless it's known that \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion constant D influences the change of u with respect to time, while the spatial second derivative of u also influences its change with respect to time. The integral transformation T applied to u results in T(u), which depends on k and t. Applying T at time t allows us to obtain T(u) at that time, and if T is applied at t = 0, it gives T(u)(x, 0)."
