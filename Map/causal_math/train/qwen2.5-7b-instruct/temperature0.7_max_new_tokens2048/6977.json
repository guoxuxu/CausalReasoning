  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant frequency parameter. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed using Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any later time t = T still be represented accurately by \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) merely results in a phase shift of the function, which does not alter the frequency content. Therefore, the initial Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = 0 continues to accurately represent the frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any other time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state of z(t) determines both its Fourier transform F(z)(ω) and the rate of change of z(t). As z(t) evolves over time according to dz/dt = iωz, its Fourier transform at any later time t=T remains consistent with the initial Fourier transform."
