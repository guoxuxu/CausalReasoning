  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are square matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors. The function describes the evolution of two components combined linearly over time and affected by different transformation matrices.\n\nCan we precisely deduce both initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) at t = 0 when given the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, knowing that matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) might not commute?",
  "Explanation": "Since matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) can have differing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and may not commute, their exponential impacts on the vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) might not be straightforwardly reversible. Unless additional conditions or constraints are known about \\\\( A, B \\\\), \\\\( x \\\\), or \\\\( y \\\\), deducing exact initial states just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is generally infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
