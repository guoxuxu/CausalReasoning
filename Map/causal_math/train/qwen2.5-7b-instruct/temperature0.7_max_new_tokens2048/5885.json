  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = f\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\), with \\\\(f\\\\) representing a source term. This domain undergoes a transformation \\\\(T\\\\) that maps it to a new domain \\\\(D'\\\\). The transformation changes how the system responds over time.\n\nIf the domain \\\\(D\\\\) is transformed to \\\\(D'\\\\) by the mapping \\\\(T\\\\), and no other change is applied, does the solution \\\\(u\\\\) to the Poisson equation on the new domain \\\\(D'\\\\) represent the same physical quantities as on the original domain \\\\(D\\\\), assuming unchanged boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The mapping \\\\(T\\\\) modifies the geometry of the domain, potentially altering the distribution and influence of the source term \\\\(f\\\\) throughout the domain. The changed geometric properties will lead to a different solution in \\\\(D'\\\\), since the Laplacian operator \\\\(\\\\nabla^2\\\\) will interact differently with these new characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T of domain D to D' changes how the system (governed by the Poisson equation) responds, but with unchanged boundary conditions, the physical quantities represented by the solution u on D' are different from those on D."
