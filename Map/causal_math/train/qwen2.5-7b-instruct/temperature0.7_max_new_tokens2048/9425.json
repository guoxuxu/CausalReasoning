  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We investigate the causal relationships under transformations by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a non-zero integer.\n\nIf \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at some point x = x_0 and allowed to evolve under its own natural properties without any further manipulation, will \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T (where T > x_0) be affected by the initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(x) = (e^{ix})^k = e^{ikx} \\\\) modifies the rate of rotation in the complex plane. Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the behavior permanently unless reversed, thus affecting \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at any later time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
