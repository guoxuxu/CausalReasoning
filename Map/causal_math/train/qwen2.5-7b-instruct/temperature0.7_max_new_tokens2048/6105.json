  "Problem": "We have a LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) system characterized by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Lx(t) = y(t) \\\\). In addition, we consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse transformation applied to \\\\( X(s) \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a Laplace transform to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and then inverse transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) back to \\\\( x(t) \\\\), will the solution \\\\( y(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) at time T be the same if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) had not undergone the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are linear and bijective operations. Applying these transformations to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then reversing them yields the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) exactly, meaning \\\\( y(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) remains unchanged after these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the inverse Laplace transform to X(s) returns the original input x(t), which when passed through the linear operator L results in y(t). Therefore, the output y(t) at time T remains unchanged by the Laplace and inverse Laplace transformations."
