  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(u) = u*e^{Ct} \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) modifies the behavior of the function by introducing a multiplicative exponential factor, which impacts the diffusion process differently than the baseline diffusion equation. The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) thus depends both on \\\\( D \\\\) and the transformation parameters \\\\( C \\\\), altering the evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
