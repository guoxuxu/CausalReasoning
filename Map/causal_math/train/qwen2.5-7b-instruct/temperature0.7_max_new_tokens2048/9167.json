  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to study its behavior over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention with another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant, is applied, will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 exclusively depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) both modify the trajectory and magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through their respective exponential factors \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\). Thus, the state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), depends not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) due to these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time depends on ω. The transformation f(z) depends on α and transforms z, while g(z) depends on β and further transforms the result. Both f(z) and g(z) ultimately influence z(T), but the initial rate of change ω is a fundamental driver of z's behavior, independent of α and β."
