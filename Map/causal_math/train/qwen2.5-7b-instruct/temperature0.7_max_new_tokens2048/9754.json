  "Problem": "Consider a system where the variable \\\\(z\\\\) is transformed by the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\\\). We analyze the outcome of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) where \\\\(n = 0, 1, ..., N-1\\\\) and its implications on the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum obtained from the DFT of the transformed sequence \\\\(f(z_n) = e^{iz_n}\\\\), is it possible to uniquely recover the original sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) without knowing the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z_n) = e^{iz_n}\\\\) affects the phase of each sequence element in a way that depends non-linearly on the original values of \\\\(z_n\\\\). This modification generally precludes uniquely recovering the original sequence from just the spectrum of the transformed sequence, especially without knowledge of the transformation function.",
