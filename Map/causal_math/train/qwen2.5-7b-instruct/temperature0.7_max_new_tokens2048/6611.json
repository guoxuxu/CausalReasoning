  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a skew-symmetric matrix. Analyze the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) over time t, where N is another skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( j(x) = e^{Pt}x \\\\) (where P is a constant skew-symmetric matrix) is applied as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention \\\\( j(x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another variable shifting the system dynamics. The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will also depend on both N and P, not just M. The way these matrices interact, especially in exponential form, could create a variety of end states, influenced by the particular characteristics and combinations of M, N, and P.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "M → dx/dt; h(x) → x(t); j(x) → x(t) if t ≥ t1",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of x with respect to time is determined by M; the state of x at any time t is transformed by h(x) through e^(Nt); if j(x) intervenes at t1, the subsequent state of x depends on both N and P; however, the final state x(T) for T > t1 depends primarily on M, with initial transformations by N and P influencing the intermediate state."
