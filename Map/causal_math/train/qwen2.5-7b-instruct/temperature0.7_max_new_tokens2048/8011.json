  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\), governing the temperature distribution u(x,t) in a rod along x axis. We consider the impact of an initial temperature distribution manipulated by the function \\\\(g(u) = Au + h\\\\), where A is a constant and h is a constant function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(y) = By - k \\\\) (where B is a constant and k is a constant function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial manipulation \\\\( g \\\\) and not on the intervention \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(y) = By - k \\\\) introduces additional changes to the temperature distribution, making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) reliant on both the initial manipulation \\\\( g \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h \\\\). The endpoint reflects the cumulative effect of both modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
