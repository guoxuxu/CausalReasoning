  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a diffusion constant. Evaluate how the Laplace transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), influences the behavior of the solution.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is it possible to perfectly reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\), the initial state, without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is known for all values of \\\\( s \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform can be used to reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\), including the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The Laplace transformation is unique, and its inversion is uniquely determined for a well-behaved function under appropriate conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion constant k influences the spatial second derivative of z, which in turn affects the time derivative of z. The Laplace transform Z(s) of z(t) is determined by z(t), and the inverse Laplace transform can theoretically reconstruct z(t) from Z(s) without ambiguity."
