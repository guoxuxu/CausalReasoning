  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the integral transform \\( I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant complex function. This scenario explores how varying \\( s \\) and operations on \\( f(t) \\) affects the transformation result.\n\nWill \\( I(s) \\) be impacted directly if the rate parameter \\( s \\) of the integral transform is increased without any other intervention on \\( f(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\( s \\) shifts the exponential decay rate in the integral, thereby directly affecting the outcome of \\( I(s) \\). This faster decay leads to a smaller value of \\( I(s) \\), emphasizing the influence of \\( s \\) on the transformed result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
