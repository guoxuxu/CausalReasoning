  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) is a function of space and time. An integral transformation particularly the Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\) is considered to observe the behavior of the system in the frequency domain over time.\n\nIf \\\\(F(u)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) for a time T without intervention, will the resulting \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) be the Fourier-transformed version of \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) directly evolved under the same conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the differential operator \\\\(L\\\\) and the Fourier transform ensures that transformation and time evolution commute. Thus, applying the Fourier transform initially or after evolving in time yields the same result due to the properties of linear systems and transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
