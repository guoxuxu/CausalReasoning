  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nKnowing that \\\\(x(t)\\\\) satisfies \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), can we conclusively trace back to determine whether the initial vector was \\\\(x_0\\\\) or \\\\(Mx_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\(x_0\\\\) and \\\\(Mx_0\\\\) satisfy the equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) when M is invertible, observing \\\\(x(t)\\\\) satisfying the equation does not uniquely determine whether the transformation was applied or not; both are valid preconditions without further distinguishing information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
