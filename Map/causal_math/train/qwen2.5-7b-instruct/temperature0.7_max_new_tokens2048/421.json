  "Problem": "Given a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( x \\\\) is a spatial variable. The function is initially defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = (K * f)(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f \\\\) is an initial function. We study how the transformation evolves under the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( (K * f)(x) \\\\) and evolved according to \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t=T \\\\) be affected by the specific choice of the kernel function \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The kernel function \\\\( K \\\\) initially transforms the function \\\\( f \\\\), altering the starting configuration of \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). Because the transformation by \\\\( K \\\\) affects the initial value condition of the PDE, it influences how the function diffuses over time, impacting the profile of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The choice of kernel function K directly influences the initial condition u(x,0), which in turn directly influences the evolution of u(x,t) over time according to the given PDE."
