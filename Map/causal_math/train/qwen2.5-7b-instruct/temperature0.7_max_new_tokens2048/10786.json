  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with M being a linear operator. An external force applies a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + k\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where k and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, acting on the state vector \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the sin term, although initially zero, could affect the trajectory in a way that is indistinguishable without knowing it was applied, especially if \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and T align such that the sin term substantially modifies the state during evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
