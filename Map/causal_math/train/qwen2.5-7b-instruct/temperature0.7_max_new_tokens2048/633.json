  "Problem": "Consider the calculation of the inverse Laplace transform of a function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\\\) which can describe a physical system's response. Further, analyze the effect of altering the Laplace domain equation by introducing a convolution with another function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nDoes directly performing the inverse Laplace transform on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without modifying the original function result in a response equivalent to the time-domain representation of unaltered system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Performing the inverse Laplace transform on \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\\\) without modifications directly results in its time-domain counterpart, which correctly represents the system's response based solely on its defined parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
