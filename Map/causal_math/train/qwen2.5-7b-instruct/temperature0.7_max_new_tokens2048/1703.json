  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We study the implications of a Laplace transformation given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) on this function over the complex variable z.\n\nIf we modify the function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\) by changing A to B and apply the Laplace transformation at a later point, will the outcome \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\) depend only on the new matrix B without any influence of A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention where A is replaced by B means the new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\) is distinct from the original and varies only due to B when transformed. The effect of A is completely overridden by B in this scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The choice of matrix A influences the form of function f(z), which in turn affects the Laplace transform L(f)(s). Similarly, the choice of matrix B influences the form of function g(z), determining L(g)(s). Once B is chosen, L(g)(s) depends solely on B and not on A."
