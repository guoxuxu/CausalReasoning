  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\\\. Analysis involves exploring Fourier transform of \\\\( u \\\\), denoted as \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), and how the frequency-domain behavior changes under specific transformations.\n\nIf an additional scaling transformation represented by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is applied to both coordinates before shifting by \\\\( v = (a, b) \\\\), resulting in transformation \\\\( w(x, y) = u(\\\\alpha(x - a), \\\\alpha (y - b)) \\\\), will the new Fourier transform \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) reflect both operations distinctly?",
  "Explanation": "The new Fourier transform, \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\), will exhibit changes due to both scaling and shifting. Scaling affects the spread (and amplitude) in the frequency domain as \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) = \\\\frac{1}{|\\\\alpha|^2} U(\\\\frac{f_x}{\\\\alpha}, \\\\frac{f_y}{\\\\alpha}) e^{-j2\\\\pi(\\\\frac{f_x a + f_y b}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\), showing both scaling and shift influences clearly.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, y) transforms to U(f_x, f_y) via its Fourier transform; applying scaling α and shifting v to u results in W(f_x, f_y), which reflects both scaling and shifting in the frequency domain."
