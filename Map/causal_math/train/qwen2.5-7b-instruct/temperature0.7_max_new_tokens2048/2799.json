  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We introduce a transformation \\\\(T(x) = Mx\\\\) where \\\\(M\\\\) is also a matrix that modifies the system prior to solving for \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point before solving, a new transformation \\\\(U(x) = Nx\\\\) (where \\\\(N\\\\) is another matrix) is applied on top of the initial transformation \\\\(T\\\\), does the final solution still remain unaffected by \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\(U(x)\\\\) further complicates the original system by altering it to \\\\(ANMx = b\\\\). Hence, both \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) will affect the outcome, altering the relationship and potentially the solution space, depending on their properties in relation to \\\\(A\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "M directly transforms x to Mx, then U further transforms it to Nx, so the effect of M on x is modified by N. The final solution's dependency on M is thus altered by the introduction of U."
