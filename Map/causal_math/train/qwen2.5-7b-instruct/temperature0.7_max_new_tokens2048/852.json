  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z(t) \\), respectively. The Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} \\) is used to analyze the system behavior in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace Transform after unknown interventions in the s-domain, can we accurately determine the original function \\( z(t) \\) along with the specific type and nature of interventions that were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the nature and specifics of the interventions applied to the Laplace Transform, recovering the precise form of the original function \\( z(t) \\) and distinguishing the interventions from multitude possible modifications (e.g., poles and zeros added) becomes indistinguishable. This uncertainty is due to overlapping effects in the transform space.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
