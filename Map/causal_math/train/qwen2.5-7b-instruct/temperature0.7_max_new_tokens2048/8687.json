  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nIf an additional decay function \\( e^{-bt} \\) is applied as an intervention at some \\( t_1 \\), will the ultimate form of \\( z(w) \\) be influenced only by \\( a \\) and not \\( b \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding \\( e^{-bt} \\) at \\( t_1 \\) significantly modifies the decay characteristics of \\( \\phi(t) \\), influencing both the rate and the ultimate spectral form. Thus \\( z(w) \\) will reflect the characteristics derived from both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the Fourier transform through φ(t) → z(w) transforms the behavior of φ(t) into z(w). The decay functions e^{-at} and e^{-bt} both affect φ(t), and at T > t_1, only the decay rate a influences the ultimate form of z(w)."
