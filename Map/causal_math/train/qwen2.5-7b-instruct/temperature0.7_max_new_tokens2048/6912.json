  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, C is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We examine the impact of transformation \\\\( h(z) = De^{iBt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is a complex constant matrix and B is another real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping influences of the matrix exponentials due to non-commutative multiplication in the complex domain, different sequences of interventions could result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without additional information, one cannot distinguish between the effects of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or their combined application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) is influenced by A, C, B, and D through the transformations h(z) and possibly k(z). Knowing z(T) alone does not precisely determine the interventions used, as multiple combinations of A, C, B, and D can lead to the same z(T)."
