  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The behavior is studied under the transformation \\\\( T(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) on the complex function.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x, y) \\\\) is applied to a pair of real numbers \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) at initial time, and then \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) is evaluated without further intervention, will \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) was directly used in \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(x, y) \\\\) changes the inputs by exponentiation, which impacts the resulting values of \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\). This means that evaluating \\\\( h \\\\) directly at \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) gives \\\\( x_0^2 + iy_0^2 \\\\), while evaluating after transformation gives \\\\( (e^{x_0})^2 + i(e^{y_0})^2 \\\\), which are generally different.",
