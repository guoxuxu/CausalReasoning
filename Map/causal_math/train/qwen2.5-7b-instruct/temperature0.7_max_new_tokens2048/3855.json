  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system where the value of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = f(z) \\\\), with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) being a nonlinear function of z. The causal influence of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant, is investigated at different time intervals.\n\nConsidering an intervention with a new function \\\\( h(z) = z^3 + d \\\\) (where d is a complex constant) is applied at some intermediate time t_1, would the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original function \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the transformations g or h?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at time t_1 fundamentally alters the pathway of the system again, making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the initial function \\\\( f \\\\), and both transformations \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\). Because every intervention transforms the state of the system, they all influence the final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z over time (dz/dt) is determined by f(z). Transformations g(z) and h(z) do not directly influence dz/dt but can affect z's value at specific times, which in turn influences z's future evolution through f(z). An intervention with h(z) at t_1 affects z's value from that point onwards, but the final state z(T) for T > t_1 depends on the cumulative effect of f(z) and the interventions applied, including h(z)."
