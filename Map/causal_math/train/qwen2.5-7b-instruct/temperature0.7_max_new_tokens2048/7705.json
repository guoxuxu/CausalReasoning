  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the behavior when a transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k \\\\) being a constant and \\\\( x \\\\) the spatial variable.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original PDE \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) by multiplying \\\\( u_0 \\\\) by \\\\( e^{ikx} \\\\) modifies the solution's structure, possibly altering how the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on the function over time. This results in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(u) = u e^(ikx) applied to u_0(x) results in a new function T(u) which, when evolved under the original PDE, leads to u(t, x). The constant k and spatial variable x determine T(u). The linear differential operator L(u) governs the evolution of u(t, x) over time."
