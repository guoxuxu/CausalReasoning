  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the heat distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). The modification introduced by \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) at the outset affects the heat distribution at time T in a way that cannot be simply reversed without specific information about the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
