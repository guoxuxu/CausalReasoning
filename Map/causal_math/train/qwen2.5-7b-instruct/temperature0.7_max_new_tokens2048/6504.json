  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nCan the exact moment and nature (i.e., value of \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)) of the intervention be deduced solely from knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a single time point \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact timing and value of \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) would require more information than \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a single point. Multiple combinations of timing and adjustment magnitudes possibly yield the same result at \\\\( t \\\\), especially due to the integral's dependence on the entire path of \\\\( \\omega(s) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( t \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
