  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf, after applying the Laplace transformation, one manipulates the \\\\( s \\\\)-domain expression by a function \\\\( f(s) \\\\), does the resulting time-domain solution solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without influence from \\\\( f(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Alteration by the function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) in the \\\\( s \\\\)-domain modifies the final inverse transform, impacting the resulting time-domain function. This change means that the resultant function does not merely reflect the original dynamics defined by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also the impact of the intervention \\\\( f(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of ω influences both z(t) and Z(s). Manipulating Z(s) with f(s) leads to Z(s)_manipulated, which then affects z(t)_new."
