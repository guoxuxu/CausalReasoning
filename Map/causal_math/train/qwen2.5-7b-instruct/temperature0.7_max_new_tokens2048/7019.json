  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), which maps a function in the time domain to a function in the complex frequency domain. Investigate the effect of modifying this transformation by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), where a is a real number.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system further at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a second Laplace operational factor \\\\( e^{-bs} \\\\), does this mean the resulting function only depends on the most recent intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant function at any point reflects the effects of all transformations applied. Even with the intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the resulting function is affected by both \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-bs} \\\\), reflecting a cumulative impact leading to a function \\\\( f(t-a-b) \\\\) in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform L[f(t)] → F(s) is modified by multiplying with e^(-as) to produce G(s), and further modified by multiplying with e^(-bs) to produce H(s). The resulting function H(s) depends on both interventions represented by e^(-as) and e^(-bs)."
