  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit comprising an inductor \\(L\\), capacitor \\(C\\), and resistor \\(R\\), governing the charge \\(Q\\) on the capacitor. The dynamics of \\(Q\\) are described by the second-order differential equation \\(L \\ddot{Q} + R \\dot{Q} + \\frac{Q}{C} = 0\\). We examine the effect of a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) introduced into the circuit at different times.\n\nFrom observing the total charge \\(Q(t)\\) at some time \\(t = T\\), can we uniquely trace back whether the sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t)\\) was applied at \\(t = 0\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed \\(Q(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\) could be a result of either natural oscillations from the RLC constants or could have contributions from the external voltage source. Unless specific characteristics of the response related to the driving frequency are identified, it would be challenging to definitively trace back the cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
