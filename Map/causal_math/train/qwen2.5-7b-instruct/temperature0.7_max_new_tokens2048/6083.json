  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a product's inventory is driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant decay rate describing how quickly items are sold or perish. We study the behavior when applying the function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\), a sales strategy intended to reduce prices as inventory decreases, thereby potentially influencing sales rate.\n\nAssume at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by adjusting inventory policy \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied. Does the final inventory level \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend solely on the original decay rate \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the effects of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final inventory level \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is influenced by multiple factors including the decay rate \\\\( k \\\\), the initial application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), and the subsequent intervention \\\\( h(x) \\\\). These modifications can significantly alter the inventory trajectory and endpoint levels.",
