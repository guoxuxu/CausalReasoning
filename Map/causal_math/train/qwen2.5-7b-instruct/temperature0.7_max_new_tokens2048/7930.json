  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance Z represented by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + 2s + 5} \\\\). We analyze the circuit's response under the Laplace transformation of an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain after a known transformation with \\\\( X(s) \\\\), can we deduce the transfer function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any additional information about the system?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) are known, the transfer function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) can be deduced by the relationship \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} \\\\). However, this deduction assumes that no other transformations influence the output which is true in this context as no interventions are mentioned.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
