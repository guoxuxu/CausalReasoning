  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), which transcribes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation is applied, such as \\\\( T[f](t)=\\\\int_0^t f(s) e^{s} ds \\\\), affecting the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state after multiple transformations (T followed by U), can we distinctly determine which transformations were applied to the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) only by knowing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the transformations, along with their integral nature, mask each other's influence and obscure the original function's characteristics in the final state. Without explicit information about the transformations applied, the trajectory and interventions cannot be unraveled or deduced from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
