  "Problem": "Investigate a control system based on the linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. Assess the impact of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the function u(x,t), denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,x)\\\\).\n\nKnowing the function \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,x)\\\\) at t = T after an intervention was applied, is it possible to precisely determine what interventions (initial Laplace transform, addition of the term) were originally used?",
  "Explanation": "Determinate interpretation of interventions from the final transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,x)\\\\) is generally elusive. The transformed state could result from various initial conditions, differential equation modifications, or other transformations, all leading to similar or indistinguishable outcomes in the Laplace domain, especially without additional constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
