  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. Over time, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( T \\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another linear operator \\\\( U(z) = z + c \\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting function at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be dependent only on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) or intervention \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( U(z) \\\\) affects the trajectory by adding a constant term \\\\( c \\\\), causing the endpoint to depend on the specifics of both the initial transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( U \\\\). The evolution becomes a result of the complex interactions among \\\\( \\omega \\\\), \\\\( T\\\\), and \\\\( U\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t depends directly on z_0 and ω, and indirectly through T(z)(t). The intervention U(z) affects z(t+Δt) but does not change the dependency of z(t) on ω and z_0."
