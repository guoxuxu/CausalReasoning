  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 by multiplying by a scalar factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), and then allowed to evolve naturally without further intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) at any frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remain unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the entire function by scaling its amplitude. This change affects the Fourier transform, which now integrates over a scaled function, resulting in an overall multiplied Fourier transform by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\). Thus, the transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) is also scaled by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
