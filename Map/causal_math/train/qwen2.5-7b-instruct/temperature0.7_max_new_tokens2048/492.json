  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), with M being a constant matrix. We examine the system's behavior under the influence of a linear operator \\\\(h(z) = Sz\\\\), where S is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven knowledge of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we unambiguously determine which interventions (\\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\) or both) were applied during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of matrix exponentials and potential similar trajectories resulting from different intervention combinations prevent unique identification of the applied interventions. Both \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(k(z)\\\\) potentially influence the outcome \\\\(z(T)\\\\), making specific determination impractical without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
