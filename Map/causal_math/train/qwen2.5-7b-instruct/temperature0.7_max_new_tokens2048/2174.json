  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + c\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the stability and transformation of the function under an integral transformation, defined as \\\\( T_h[f](z) = \\\\int_0^1 e^{ht} f(tz) dt \\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a real constant parameter.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T_h[f](z) \\\\) at some \\\\( z \\\\), can we precisely infer the original function \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) at \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T_h \\\\) involves an integral accumulation of function values modified by \\\\( e^{ht} \\\\) and scaled inputs, resulting in a loss of direct information about specific function evaluations at any particular \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation aggregates multiple evaluations, making it impossible to deduce a unique inverse.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the original function f(z) directly influences the transformed function T_h[f](z), and the parameters h, z, and t also directly influence T_h[f](z). The value of the original function f(z_0) is independent of h, z, and t."
