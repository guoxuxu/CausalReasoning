  "Problem": "Assume the function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number, represents a physical process. We explore the effects of the operation \\( h(z) = e^{kt}z \\) on \\( z(t) \\), with \\( k \\) being another real constant.\n\nKnowing only the eventual state \\( z(T) \\), can the specific sequence or types of interventions (whether \\( h(z) \\), \\( j(z) \\), or both) be distinctly identified?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( z(T) \\), it isn't feasible to uniquely discern the interventions employed due to the fundamental properties of exponential transformations on the complex plane, which can result in multiple operation sequences leading to an indistinguishable state \\( z(T) \\). Thus, the same endpoint could potentially arise from different transformation histories.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
