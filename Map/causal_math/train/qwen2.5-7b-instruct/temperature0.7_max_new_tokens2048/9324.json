  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We evaluate the effect of a Fourier transform applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0) = u_0(x)\\\\).\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), can we correctly infer the occurrence of the initial Fourier transform and any inverse Fourier transform intervention knowing only the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) might be achievable by various transformations and interventions, including different combinations of Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms or none. The end result does not uniquely indicate the specific sequence of interventions unless all transitional states are known, making identification from final state alone impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) directly influences the state u(x,T). Applying a Fourier transform to u(x,0) results in u(x,T). An inverse Fourier transform on u(x,T) recovers u(x,0)."
