  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal influence under a system governed by a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\). Suppose this system evolves through different transformations and interventions represented by high-order derivatives in the spectral domain, specifically considering how various filters influence the signal.\n\nIf an intervention applies a damping factor, say \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), to the Laplace transform at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformed system's output at time \\\\( t_2 > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced damping factor significantly transforms the system's dynamics by modifying how feedback and response characteristics are shaped over time. The final output at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) will depend not just on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) but also on the damping effect of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
