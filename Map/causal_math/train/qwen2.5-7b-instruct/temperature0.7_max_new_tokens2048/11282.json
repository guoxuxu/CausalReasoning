  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, and A and B are real constants. This function is used to transform the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-(iA + B)t} z(t) dt \\\\) affects the output over a period T.\n\nGiven the outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) at T, is it possible to uniquely determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether additional functions were applied to it?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) at T is influenced by the exponential factors involving both A and B through the interval. Without knowledge of these factors or potential other transformations, one cannot retrospectively deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially given the loss of information inherent in integration over an interval.",
