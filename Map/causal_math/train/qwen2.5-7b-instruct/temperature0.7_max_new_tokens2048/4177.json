  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation studied involves the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, does the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) match the original evolution of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) without using \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory from a simple exponential growth to one that integrates past states of the system due to the transformation's accumulating nature. This makes the new system trajectory different from the unaltered exponential evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
