  "Problem": "Evaluate the real part of the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a, b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(t\\\\) is the time variable. We explore an integral transformation by applying Laplace transform on this complex function.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform of the function, can the exact values of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) be determined precisely without any assumptions?",
  "Explanation": "The poles of the Laplace transform, which in this case is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a-bi} \\\\), precisely indicate the values of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) as they represent the real and imaginary parts of the pole respectively. Thus, exact values can be determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
