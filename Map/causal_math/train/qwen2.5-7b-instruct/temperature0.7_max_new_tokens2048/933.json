  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Pz \\\\), where P is a linear operator. Investigate the effects of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Qz \\\\) where Q is a transformation matrix applied at various time epochs.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and the system is then let to evolve according to \\\\( z' = Pz \\\\) up to time t = S, will the state \\\\( z(S) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had evolved directly under \\\\( z' = Pz \\\\) for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially changes the starting state to \\\\( Qz_0 \\\\). Due to the system dynamics governed by P, the evolution pathway of \\\\( Qz_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z' = Pz \\\\) can be different than that of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The effect of Q fundamentally alters the trajectory, leading to a different state at time S.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) = Qz to the initial state z_0 at t=0 and then evolving the state according to z' = Pz up to time t=S results in a state z(S) that is different from the state that would have been obtained if z_0 had evolved directly under z' = Pz for the same duration."
