  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. A linear transformation by a complex matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function, resulting in \\\\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact matrix \\\\( M \\\\) by observing the trajectory \\\\( w(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( M \\\\) explicitly, assuming knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) and given that multiple matrices could produce similar transformations in the complex plane, it's impossible to uniquely identify \\\\( M \\\\) just by observing \\\\( w(t) \\\\). The general properties of complex matrices do not guarantee unique solutions for \\\\( M \\\\) when only outputs are observed.",
