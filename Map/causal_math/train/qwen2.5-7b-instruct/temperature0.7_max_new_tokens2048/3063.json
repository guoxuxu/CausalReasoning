  "Problem": "Consider the field of Complex Functions and Integral Transforms, specifically focusing on the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\). The initial function is \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined for \\\\( t \\\\geq 0 \\\\). Suppose we apply the Laplace Transform to derive \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), and examine scenarios where various operations or interventions are applied, such as modifying the function or applying inverse transformations.\n\nIf an intervention occurs where the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is multiplied by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) before applying the Laplace Transform, will the resulting transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be independent of the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ e^{-at}f(t) \\\\}(s) \\\\) is related to the original transform shifted in the s-domain, specifically \\\\( G(s) = F(s+a) \\\\). The transformation depends directly on the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and the parameter \\\\( a \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying the function f(t) by e^(-a*t) before applying the Laplace Transform results in a different transform G(s) which is dependent on the original F(s) through the shift theorem."
