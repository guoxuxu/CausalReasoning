  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant, at different points in time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without confirmation whether the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is indeterminate, as \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could represent multiple initial conditions altered by different values of \\\\( C \\\\). The transformation masks or alters the original properties of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
