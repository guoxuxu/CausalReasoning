  "Problem": "Assume a system governs the motion of a particle along a path on the complex plane, given by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial position and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant complex frequency. We consider transformations of the path using a mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling parameter.\n\nAssuming an intervention using a different mapping \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant complex number) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformed trajectory at time T > t_1 solely depend on the original motion parameters (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\)) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial transformation and the intervention alter the path. The trajectory at time T is affected by all three parameters: \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). The particle's path faces complex exponential scalings at different intervals, leading to a compounded effect that depends on all applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial position z_0 and the constant complex frequency ω determine the particle's motion z(t). The mappings f(z) and g(z) transform z(t) but do not influence the original motion parameters. Therefore, the transformed trajectory z(T) at time T > t_1 depends only on z_0 and ω."
