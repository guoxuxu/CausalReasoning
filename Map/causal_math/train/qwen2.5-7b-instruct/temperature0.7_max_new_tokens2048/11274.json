  "Problem": "Consider a linear partial differential equation governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the role of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\) on this system, considering both forward and reverse implications in variable transformations.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\(U(s)\\\\) of a function \\\\(u(t)\\\\) that solves \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), can we unequivocally retrieve the exact function \\\\(u(t)\\\\) without knowing initial conditions explicitly?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace Transform encodes all information about the function over its entire domain, retrieving the original function \\\\(u(t)\\\\) accurately from \\\\(U(s)\\\\) requires explicit knowledge of initial conditions, which are critical to reverse the transform completely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform U(s) of a function u(t) that satisfies the PDE ∂u/∂t = Lu provides a transformed representation from which u(t) can be retrieved given initial conditions, and conversely, u(t) can be transformed into U(s) through the Laplace Transform."
