  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and i is the imaginary unit. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation expressed by \\\\( w(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A is a constant complex number, and investigate the system's response to various interventions.\n\nIf an intervention, modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant complex number, is applied at t = t_1 < T, will the outcome \\\\( w'(z) \\\\) at T reflect changes only due to B and not A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( z'(t) = e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\) provides a new pathway for the information flow starting from t_1, and thus the effect on \\\\( w'(z) \\\\) at T is influenced not only by B but also continues to be affected by the exponential factor involving A through its continued integral impact on the modified \\\\( z'(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) directly influences w(z). Modifying z(t) to z'(t) through the factor e^(Bt) directly influences w'(z). The constant A directly influences w(z), while B indirectly influences w(z) via its effect on z'(t)."
