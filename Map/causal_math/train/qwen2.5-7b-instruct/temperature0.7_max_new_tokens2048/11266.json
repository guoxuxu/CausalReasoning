  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), representing a Laplace transform of a time-domain function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). We explore how applying an integral transformation and its inverse affects our ability to infer causal relationships in the transformed domain.\n\nGiven only the transformed function \\\\( z(s) \\\\), and not knowing whether any transformations (including nonlinear or distortionary transformations) have been applied before taking the Laplace transform, can you uniquely deduce \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If additional unknown transformations (alteration of the domain, non-linear distortions, etc.) were applied before the Laplace transform, the simple inverse transformation will not generally retrieve the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\), because these transformations can fundamentally alter the function in ways not reversible by the Laplace inverse alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time-domain function x(t) is transformed into the frequency-domain function z(s) through the Laplace transform, and this transformation can be reversed to recover x(t) from z(s) if no other transformations were applied beforehand."
