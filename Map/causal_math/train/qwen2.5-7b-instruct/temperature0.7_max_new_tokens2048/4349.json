  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) on the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real, positive constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The impact of transforming the system using \\\\( z(t) x(t) \\\\) is studied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then it evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\) without any further intervention, will the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\) till \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) changes the magnitude and phase of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), which leads to a trajectory influenced by the complex term as well. The solution will be different due to these initial modifications imposed by the complex function.",
