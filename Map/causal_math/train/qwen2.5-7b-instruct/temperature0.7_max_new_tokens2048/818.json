  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system with a controlled function \\\\(F(x, u) = A x + B u\\\\), where x is the state vector, u is the control input, A is the state matrix, and B is the control matrix. We are interested in the impact of a perturbation transformation \\\\(h(x) = Cx\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on the evolution of the state vector over time under the control strategy that minimizes a quadratic cost function.\n\nGiven the final state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the perturbation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) solely from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is infeasible without extra information about the initial conditions or control inputs, as multiple initial states or control strategies might yield the same final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
