  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf \\( F(z) \\) is applied to an initial state \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved under \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( F(z) \\) changes the initial condition to \\( e^{\\lambda 0} z_0 = z_0 \\), but as time progresses, \\( z(t) \\) evolves differently due to the exponential term \\( e^{\\lambda t} \\), causing a deviation in trajectory compared to simply evolving \\( z_0 \\) under \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
