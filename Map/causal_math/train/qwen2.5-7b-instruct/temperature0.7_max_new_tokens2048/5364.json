  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential overlap in the effects of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\) and their non-commutative properties with respect to time evolution, multiple transformation scenarios may lead to the same final state. This ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely identify which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(t) evolves to z(T) over time T through the transformation T(z). The transformation T(z) depends on the constant matrix A, and the initial state z(t) is influenced by the complex constant C and the angular frequency ω."
