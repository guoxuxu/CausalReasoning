  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system described by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is defined in the complex domain. Let's analyze an intervention using an inverse mapping \\\\( g(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)] \\\\) where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is another complex function.\n\nIf an intervention via an inverse transform \\\\( g(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)] \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (T > t_1) be a straightforward combination of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), unaffected by the structure of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state after applying the intervention \\\\( g(t) \\\\) will generally involve a convolution or composite effect between \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), determined by interaction terms or convolution integral, depending on the specifics of the Laplace transforms involved. The output state is affected by both \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention via the inverse transform g(t) = 𝒫ℒ⁻¹[H(s)] at time t₁ influences the final state at t = T (T > t₁); this state is not simply a combination of f(t) and g(t) and is affected by the structure of both F(s) and H(s)."
