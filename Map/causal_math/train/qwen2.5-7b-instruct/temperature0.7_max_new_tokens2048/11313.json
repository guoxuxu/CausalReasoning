  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a diagonal matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), will the resultant state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be affected solely by M and not by the initial application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) to the state vector modifies the initial condition, affecting how the solution evolves according to \\\\( M \\\\). Since \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) influences the starting point, it indirectly affects the trajectory and final state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state x(t) is influenced by both the complex function z(t) and the matrix M. The state at time T, x(T), is determined by the evolution of x(t) according to the differential equation and is thus affected by M but not directly by z(t)."
