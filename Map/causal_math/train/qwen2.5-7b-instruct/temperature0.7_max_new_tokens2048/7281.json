  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) evolving under the dynamics described by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) is a complex constant. The impact of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Qt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is another complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\(t = T\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\) initially changes the starting condition by a factor of \\\\(e^{Qt}\\\\), and the evolution under \\\\(P\\\\) then proceeds from a different initial state. The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on both \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\), leading to a different trajectory and endpoint.",
