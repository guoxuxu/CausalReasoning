  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Evaluate the change in the function through an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a different complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is used to transform \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without any alteration in parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), does the transformed function \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) reflect the same transformation as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly calculated at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the representation of the function, introducing an entirely different dependence on \\\\( t \\\\) across the entire interval from 0 to T, unlike the direct computation of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) at a specific point T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
