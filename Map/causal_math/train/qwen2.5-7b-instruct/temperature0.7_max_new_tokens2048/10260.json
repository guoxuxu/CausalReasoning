  "Problem": "Evaluate the influence of a complex transformation defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) on the stability of solutions to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\), can we distinctly determine whether the initial transformation \\\\( z(w_0) \\\\) or the later intervention \\\\( h(w(t_1)) \\\\) was applied, by only knowing the value of \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex function transformations and non-linear interaction mean that similar endpoint states \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\) could result from various combinations of initial conditions and interventions. The ambiguity and overlap in potential effects and states of the system ensure that multiple causal pathways could yield indistinguishable results at \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
