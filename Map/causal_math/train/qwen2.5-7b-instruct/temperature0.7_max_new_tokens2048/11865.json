  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, with an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and an output \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Let's assume an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) is applied where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf only \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) is known, can we determine if \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before computing the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Deducing the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or the usage of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) merely from \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) is challenging without additional information about the possible transformations applied prior to the Laplace transform, due to the many potential functions that could yield the same transformed result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the Laplace transform to x(t) results in y(t), and the application of the exponential transformation g(t) to x(t) precedes the Laplace transform to produce y(t). Knowing y'(t) does not directly indicate whether g(t) was applied to x(t) before the Laplace transform."
