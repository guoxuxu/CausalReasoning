  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical study of electrical circuits where the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) through a component is influenced by the Laplace transform applied to a time-dependent voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\). The system's differential equation is given by \\\\( I'(t) = L{V(t)} + RI(t) \\\\), with R being the resistance.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an inverse Laplace transform is applied as an intervention to the voltage source, will the final current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still be independent of the original transform applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The application and subsequent inverse Laplace transform at different times introduce complex modifications to the input, causing the final observed current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) to be dependent not only on the resistance R but also significantly on the transformations applied. These transformations can interact in ways that influence the end result distinctively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
