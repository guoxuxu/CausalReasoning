  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing the amplitude and angular frequency respectively. For analysis, a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) is used, representing a Fourier transform component.\n\nIf a perturbation \\\\( g(z) = z(t) + \\\\delta e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) are parameters, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the result of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T still reflect only the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds an additional component to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), potentially at a different frequency or phase. This modification changes the outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), which is sensitive to changes in the amplitude or phase of the components at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The outcome can include contributions from the perturbation, thus not solely reflecting the original frequency.",
