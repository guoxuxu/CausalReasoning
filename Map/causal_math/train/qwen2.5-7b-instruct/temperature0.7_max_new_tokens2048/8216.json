  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and its integral transformation using a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum obtained from the Fourier transform of the damped function, \\\\( F(a, \\\\omega) \\\\), can we definitively determine whether the original function was damped and if so, by exactly what damping factor \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While a shift and broadening in the spectrum indicate damping, quantifying the exact damping factor solely from the spectrum can be challenging without additional data. Multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can result in similar spectral profiles, especially considering potential measurement or estimation errors.",
