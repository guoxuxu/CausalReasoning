  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\( u(x, 0) \\) after observing \\( u(x, t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( F(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the Fourier transform was applied, the evolution of \\( u(x, t) \\) under the heat equation is well-defined and reversible for both the original and transformed states. The linearity and reversibility of the heat equation in both the spatial and frequency domains ensure that \\( u(x, 0) \\) can be accurately recovered from \\( u(x, T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u(x, 0) can be inferred from u(x, t) at t = T if the Fourier transform F(u) was not applied, as the heat equation and the properties of the Fourier transform dictate that the evolution of u(x, t) is uniquely determined by its initial condition."
