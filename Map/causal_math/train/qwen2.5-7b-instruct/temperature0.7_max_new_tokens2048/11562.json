  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effect of Fourier transforming the function u(x, t), represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), and modifying the transformed function with a multiplier function \\\\( m(k) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) if no Fourier transformation or multipliers were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the system is stable and reversible, knowing the evolution equation and the final state allows for computation of the initial state using inverse methods, assuming no transformations modify the spectral components externally.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state of u(x, T) influences u(x, 0) through the inverse Fourier transform; L(u) changes u(x, t) over time; applying the Fourier transform to u(x, t) yields \\( \\hat{u}(k, t) \\); multiplying \\( \\hat{u}(k, t) \\) with m(k) further modifies u(x, t)"
