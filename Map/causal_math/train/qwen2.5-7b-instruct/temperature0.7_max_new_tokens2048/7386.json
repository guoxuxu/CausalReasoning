  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), applied to this function over variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\omega} \\\\), can we determine the exact \\\\( \\omega \\\\) used in \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is clearly identifiable from the denominator of the Laplace transform result. The value \\\\( i\\omega \\\\) is the sole pole of the transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s) \\\\), enabling the direct determination of \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( \\omega \\) determines the form of \\( g(t) \\), which when transformed via the Laplace transform, results in \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i\\omega} \\). The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s) \\) depends on both \\( s \\) and \\( \\omega \\), but knowing \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s) \\) alone does not uniquely determine \\( \\omega \\) without additional information."
