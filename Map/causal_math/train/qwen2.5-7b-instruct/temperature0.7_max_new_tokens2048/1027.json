  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real function of time t and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\), with A being a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) such that a new function \\\\( x(t) = x(t) + h(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a real function) is applied, will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by adding \\\\( h(t) \\\\) changes the subsequent trajectory, which, when transformed to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), still retains the dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) dictates that the resultant function \\\\( z(T) \\\\), representing both magnitude and phase, continues to depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in addition to how \\\\( h(t) \\\\) has altered the source trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "x(t) directly influences z(t) and z(T) through the transformation z(t) = e^(iωt)x(t). An intervention on x(t) will affect z(T) for T > t_1, thus z(T) is not independent of ω."
