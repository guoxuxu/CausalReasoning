  "Problem": "Considering a complex function and its transformation by a linear operator, let \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) be a time-dependent complex function. The linear operator \\( L \\) acts on \\( z \\) such that \\( L(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing the resultant function at time \\( T \\), can we deduce the original function \\( z(0) \\) without knowing if the operator \\( L \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\( L \\) alters the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) by convolution with the exponential term, without explicit knowledge of the operator's application, recovering the initial state \\( z(0) \\) uniquely from \\( z(T) \\) is not possible due to the irreversible integration process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear operator L to the initial function z(0) results in the transformed function z(T) at time T. The original function z(0) influences the intermediate function z(t) which, through the operator L, leads to the observed function z(T) at time T."
