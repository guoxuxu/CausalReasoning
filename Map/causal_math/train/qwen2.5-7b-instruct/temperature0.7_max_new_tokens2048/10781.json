  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional domain. Let \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) be the velocity field, and suppose a transformation by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\psi \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a stream function representing a perturbation.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) into the initial condition \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to the Navier-Stokes equations without further intervention, will the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without the introduction of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the perturbation through \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) modifies the initial conditions and hence, influences the evolution of the velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\). Depending on the nature of \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\), the change can lead to different flow patterns, instabilities, or transitions to turbulence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The stream function ψ influences the vector field v, which in turn affects the velocity field u(x, y, t). The initial condition u_0 evolves to u(x, y, t) over time t. At t=0, introducing v changes the evolution path of u from u_0 to u, and at t=T, the final state of u depends on whether v was introduced or not."
