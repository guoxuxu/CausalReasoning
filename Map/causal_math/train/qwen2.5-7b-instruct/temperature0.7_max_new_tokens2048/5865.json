  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We also consider a Laplace transformation, where \\\\(L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt\\\\) is applied.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transformation to \\\\(z_0\\\\) initially and then let it evolve via \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\(L(z)(s)\\\\) at a future point be identical to transforming the state after it has evolved to that point under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation alters the function in a way that affects its subsequent evolution under the differential equation. The Laplace transformation integrates over an exponential weighted complete history of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), changing how the function would evolve compared to untransformed \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the initial state L(z_0)(s) does not directly cause the Laplace transform of the evolved state L(z)(s) at a future point. Instead, the evolution of z(t) over time due to the differential equation leads to a change in its Laplace transform, such that L(z(t))(s) causally influences L(z(t+Δt))(s)."
