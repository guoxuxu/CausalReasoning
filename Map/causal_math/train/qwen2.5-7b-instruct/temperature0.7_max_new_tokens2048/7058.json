  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex constant, is considered.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation induced by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could mask the original value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially since \\\\( C \\\\) introduces complex dynamics that are not simply reversible by observing the separate real and imaginary components' evolution.",
