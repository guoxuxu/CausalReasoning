  "Problem": "Analyze a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied on an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) within a linear system governed by \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\). The concern here is how transformations and external interventions affect the evolution of the system over time.\n\nConsider an intervention with another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\\\) at time t = t_1. Will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the original dynamics \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\) and not on the initial application of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the evolution path by changing the system's phase and frequency starting from t_1, thereby making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend on both the initial application of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( e^{i\\theta t} \\\\), as well as the intrinsic system dynamics \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) depends on the original dynamics of z(t), the initial value z_0, and the intervention h(z) applied at t=t_1. Specifically, z(T) = z(t_1) * h(z) * e^(-i(T-t_1)) where z(t_1) = z_0 * e^(iωt_1)."
