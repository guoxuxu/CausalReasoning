  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{tt} = -\\Delta u + \\lambda u \\\\), where \\\\( \\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a scalar parameter. We explore the effect of an initial condition manipulation described by \\\\( u(0,x) = \\phi(x) \\\\) and an impulse transformation \\\\( u_t(0,x) = \\psi(x) \\\\), where \\\\(\\phi(x)\\\\) and \\\\(\\psi(x)\\\\) are specific functions.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately infer whether an intervention that changed \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) occurred, solely based on the final state \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying an intervention like a change in \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) solely from the state at time T is challenging without additional information. The effects caused by varying \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) might induce similar results as different initial conditions or other system influences, making it non-trivial to pinpoint the intervention from the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The second-order time derivative of u (u_tt) directly influences u, the Laplacian of u (Δu) directly influences u, and the scalar parameter λ influences u. The initial condition u(0,x) and the initial velocity u_t(0,x) both directly influence the state u(T,x) at time T."
