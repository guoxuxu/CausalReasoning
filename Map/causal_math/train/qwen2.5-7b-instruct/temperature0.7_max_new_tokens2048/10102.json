  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function in a variable \\\\( t \\\\). The dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant. We test the effects of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it's unclear whether the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\) results solely from the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) or from a modified initial condition via \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The uncertainty in the original state or transformation precludes precise determination of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
