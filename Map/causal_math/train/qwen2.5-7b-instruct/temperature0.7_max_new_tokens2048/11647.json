  "Problem": "In a theoretical study, consider the mapping of complex variables using the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) a complex number. This function represents a rotation in the complex plane. We inspect the effects of spatial transformations by separate function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iB(T-t_1)}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be independent of the parameter \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional rotation by \\\\( B \\\\) in the interval \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\). The final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus becomes dependent on both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\), resulting from the compositional effect of both rotations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → z(t); B → g(z); z(t) → z(T); g(z) → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter B influences g(z), which in turn influences z(T). Since g(z) is applied to z(t) at time t1, and z(t) evolves over time according to A, the final position z(T) depends on both A and B."
