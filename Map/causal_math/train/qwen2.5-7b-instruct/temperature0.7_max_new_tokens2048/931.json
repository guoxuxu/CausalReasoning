  "Problem": "We examine the stability and effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T_w [f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-wt} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf at a specific value \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we modify \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct} \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another complex constant) and apply \\\\( T_w \\\\), will the outcome be solely influenced by function \\\\( A \\\\) and not by \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) meaning the outcome of \\\\( T_w \\\\) now depends critically on \\\\( C \\\\) as well as \\\\( A \\\\). The transformation is sensitive to the changes in the function it acts upon, leading to outcomes affected by both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The outcome of applying the integral transformation T_w to g(t) is influenced by C through g(t) and by A through T_w."
