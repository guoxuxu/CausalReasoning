  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane function defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{f(z)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) and a, b, c are complex numbers. Investigate the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = dz + e \\\\) on z, where d and e are also complex numbers, on the mapping of the function w.\n\nIf a secondary transformation \\\\( U(z) = gz + h \\\\) (where g and h are complex numbers) is applied as an intervention at some z, will the outcome of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) for any z depend only on \\\\( d \\\\) and \\\\( e \\\\) and not on \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a new transformation \\\\( U(z) \\\\) further modifies how \\\\( z \\\\) is processed before entering \\\\( w(z) \\\\). Since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is highly sensitive to the input due to its non-linear structure, the final outcome is influenced by all parameters (d, e, g, h), affecting how the input is computed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear transformation T(z) influences the mapping of the function w(z), while the subsequent application of the transformation U(z) does not further affect w(z) once T(z) has been applied."
