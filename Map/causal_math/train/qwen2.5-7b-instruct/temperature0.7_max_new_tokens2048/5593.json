  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a system in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P + iQ)z \\\\), with real matrices P and Q. Examine the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{(C + iD)t}z \\\\), where C and D are also real matrices.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P + iQ)z \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to t = T under the original system without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory by an exponential factor \\\\( e^{(C + iD)t} \\\\). This factor changes both amplitude and phase components in the complex vector, resulting in a state at time T that differs from simple evolution under \\\\( (P + iQ)z \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) applied at t=0 followed by evolution under the differential equation dz/dt = (P + iQ)z will result in z(t) at t=T being equivalent to the state of z evolving from z(0) under the original system."
