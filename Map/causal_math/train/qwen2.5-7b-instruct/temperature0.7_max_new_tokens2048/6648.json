  "Problem": "Investigate the interplay between two functions, \\\\( p(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\) and \\\\( q(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, and their effects within the integral transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nKnowing the outcome of the integrated transformation with interventions applied, can one definitively determine whether \\\\( p(z) \\\\) or \\\\( q(z) \\\\) was used, or the order in which they were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interactions and the inherent properties of integral transformations with complex functions, it is extremely difficult to parse out which functions or their order was used just from the outcome. Both manipulations could yield overlapping or indistinguishable effects given the non-linear and exponential nature of the functions involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function p(z) influences the integral transformation I[p(z)], q(z) influences I[q(z)], and if the results of I[p(z)] and I[q(z)] are different, it is impossible to definitively determine which function was used or the order of their application."
