  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in the domain describing a physical system. The transformation is defined by an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( v(x) = (T u)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} U(x, y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nIf an intervention via another integral transform \\\\( S \\\\) with kernel \\\\( V(x, y) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) depend solely on the operator \\\\( A \\\\) without influence from \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\) or \\\\( V(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\( S \\\\) during the system's evolution introduces complexities in the final state, making it dependent on both kernel functions \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( V \\\\), along with the operator \\\\( A \\\\). The effects of each kernel cannot be ignored or separated from the influences of the linear operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The operator L acting on the function u(x) through the integral transform T produces v(x), which is then further transformed by S to produce W(x). The final state v(T) depends on the operator A, but the specific forms of U(x, y) and V(x, y) do not directly influence v(T) if A is the only operator considered."
