  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across a capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{C}I\\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and I is current. Evaluate the impact of a sudden change in current input described by a Heaviside step function \\\\( I(t) = I_0u(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside function and \\\\( I_0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the voltage V(t) at t = T, can we infer the value of \\\\( I_0 \\\\) without knowing the resistance R and capacitance C?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of the resistance R and capacitance C is crucial to accurately deduce \\\\( I_0 \\\\) from the voltage. The voltage response depends on both parameters, and without them, it's impossible to isolate the effect of \\\\( I_0 \\\\) on the voltage.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The current I(t) directly influences the voltage V(t) through the differential equation. The resistance R and capacitance C directly affect the rate of change of voltage dV/dt."
