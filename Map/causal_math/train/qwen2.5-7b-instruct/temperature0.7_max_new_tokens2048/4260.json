  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex function z(t). The functions are related through the Laplace Transform: \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at some time T, can we determine which specific operation so as the exponential decay parameter a was used during the transformation, based solely on the outcome \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple operations having different parameters or characteristics can yield similar outcomes in functional transformations, especially over complex domains involving integrals and exponentials. Identifying a specific decay parameter a or confirming the exact nature of transformations applied from the outcome space \\\\( w(t) \\\\) alone isn't feasible without additional information about the initial conditions or parameter values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The real part u(t) and imaginary part v(t) of z(t) are determined by the function itself. The Laplace transforms U(s) and V(s) of u(t) and v(t) respectively are influenced by z(t). The values of U(s) and V(s) at time T can be used to infer the original u(t) and v(t), but cannot directly determine if an exponential decay parameter a was used in the transformation."
