  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega t} w \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The system under study is defined by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation on the system evolution.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\theta t}w \\\\) (where \\\\( \\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(w) \\\\) imposes an additional modulation, making the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\). The transformations \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\theta t} \\\\) can interact in complex ways, affecting the system's trajectory to an endpoint that depends on both constants.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
