  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, with an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and an output \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Let's assume an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) is applied where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) before applying the Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( y'(t) \\\\), does \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) differ from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) obtained without applying \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the input by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) essentially modifies the original function, thus altering the Laplace transform. The effect of the exponential function results in a shifted or scaled version of the original transform, significantly changing the output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(t) = e^(-at) to the input x(t) before Laplace transforming results in a different output y'(t) compared to directly Laplace transforming x(t) to get y(t)."
