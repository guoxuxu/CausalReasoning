  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impacts of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the function over time, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after transformations and the natural evolution of the system, can we accurately deduce the exact sequence or nature of transformations (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) used, solely based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the nature and sequence of transformations from the final state alone is highly complex and generally not feasible without additional information. The exponential transformations could result in similar or overlapping effects on the trajectory, making it difficult to distinguish between the effects of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or to assert if both were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The imaginary unit i and angular frequency ω together determine the rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt). The complex constant λ also contributes to this rate of change. The real constant α influences the transformation g(z) applied to z over time. Time T determines the final state z(T) after the transformation."
