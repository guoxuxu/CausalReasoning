  "Problem": "Investigate a discrete dynamical system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant square matrix representing the evolution operator, and \\\\( x_n \\\\) is the state vector at the n-th step. We also explore the influence on the system of applying a nonlinear transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a constant vector.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is introduced to initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\) without any further intervention, will the state vector \\\\( x_n \\\\) at step n be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to step n under \\\\( M \\\\) with no initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( x_0 + u \\\\). Each subsequent step multiplies this altered state by \\\\( M \\\\). Hence, the trajectory of \\\\( x_n \\\\) is shifted by \\\\( M^n u \\\\) at every step compared to the purely linear evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( M \\\\), resulting in a different state vector at each step.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the nonlinear transformation h to the initial vector x0 results in a new initial state x1, which then evolves under the linear transformation M to produce subsequent states x2 through x_n."
