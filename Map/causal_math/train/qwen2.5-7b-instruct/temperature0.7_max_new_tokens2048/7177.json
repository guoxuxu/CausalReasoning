  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex vectors and A and B are constant complex matrices. We explore the outcome when applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[w] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-Ct}w(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) for a fixed time T, where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( T[w] \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any other changes, will the resulting function at time T still solely depend on matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( T[w] \\\\) integrates the function over time, which interacts with the exponentials involving matrices A, B, and C. Even though the initial function depends on A and B, the transformation introduces a dependency on C due to the integration process, ultimately affecting the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
