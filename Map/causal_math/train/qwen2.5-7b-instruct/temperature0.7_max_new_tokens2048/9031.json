  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). The impact of a Fourier transform on the wave function is studied to see how it affects the system's evolution.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional potential \\\\( W(x) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, and the transformation is Fourier transformed thereafter, will the endpoint \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be affected solely by \\\\( V(x) \\\\) and not by the Fourier transform or \\\\( W(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional potential \\\\( W(x) \\\\) and the subsequent Fourier transform both affect the system's evolution. The endpoint \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\) is influenced by the initial conditions, the original potential \\\\( V(x) \\\\), the intervention potential \\\\( W(x) \\\\), and the transform, reflecting changes in momentum-space dynamics that are carried back into position-space.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing an additional potential W(x) at time t1 and applying a Fourier transform affect the wave function ψ(x, t) which then influences the endpoint ψ(x, T) for T > t1. The endpoint ψ(x, T) depends on V(x), W(x), and the effects of the Fourier transform on ψ(x, t)."
