  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of an oscillating term. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is also a constant.\n\nIf an intervention using another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where T > t_1 be influenced only by the dynamics defined by A and not by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds an additional layer of complexity, modifying the trajectory and thereby making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a result of the interplay between A, C, and D. The transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) modify how the system evolves, affecting the final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A directly influences z(t); Bsin(ωt) directly influences z(t); C and D indirectly influence z(t) through f(z) and g(z) respectively, but after applying g(z) at t_1, z(t) is primarily influenced by A."
