  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, capacitor, and resistor (LCR circuit) where its behavior is described by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = 0\\\\). An external voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{st}\\\\) is considered as a function transformation applying to the system.\n\nGiven the total response \\\\(i(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine whether the external voltage source \\\\(V(t)\\\\) was applied, assuming no other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The response \\\\(i(t)\\\\) at t = T could potentially be due to various initial conditions or different parameters within the LCR circuit. Without additional information, the direct influence of \\\\(V(t)\\\\) cannot be uniquely isolated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The external voltage source V(t), inductance L, resistance R, capacitance C, and time t jointly determine the current i(t) in the LCR circuit."
