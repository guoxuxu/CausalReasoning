  "Problem": "Consider two complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(t)\\\\) where \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and \\\\(w(t) = \\\\log(t)\\\\). The scenario examines the relationship between these functions under different operations and transformations such as differentiation and integration in the complex plane.\n\nIf an integration operation is applied to both \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(t)\\\\) from time 0 to T, can the resulting value of the integral of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) independently influence the integral result of \\\\(w(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) from 0 to T involves computing the area under a curve on the complex plane, resulting in \\\\(\\\\frac{e^{iT} - 1}{i}\\\\). Meanwhile, the integral of \\\\(w(t) = \\\\log(t)\\\\) from 0 to T involves a completely different mathematical structure and results in a distinct value unrelated to that of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). Hence, each integral computes independently, and one does not affect the other.",
