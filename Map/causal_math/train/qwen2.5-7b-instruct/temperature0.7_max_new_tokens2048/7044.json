  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar, is analyzed for its effects over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The possible overlap in the effects of C and D on the trajectory of z from t = 0 to T means multiple combinations of interventions could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The scalar exponential factors influencing the real and imaginary parts independently complicate the ability to uniquely trace back the interventions without additional information.",
