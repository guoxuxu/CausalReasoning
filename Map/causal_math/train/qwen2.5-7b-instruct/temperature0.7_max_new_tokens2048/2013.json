  "Problem": "Consider the linear integro-differential equation governing a system: \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(x, t) y(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) are known functions. We're investigating the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( y(x) \\\\) and then studying the system's behavior under transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y(x) \\\\) initially and then the system evolves under its differential equation without further intervention, will the transformed system at \\\\( X \\\\) after time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( y(x) \\\\) evolved without applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the initial condition by switching to frequency domain. The evolution under the modified conditions, especially dealing with the integro-differential nature and the specific functions \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\), will diverge from the untransformed system's trajectory.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to y(x) initially results in a transformed function that, when evolved according to the given integro-differential equation, may differ from the original y(x) evolving without transformation due to the integral term involving g(x, t) and the differential term involving p(x)."
