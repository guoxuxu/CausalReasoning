  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system defined by \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x is an initial vector. Evaluate the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nBased on knowing the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine which transformations (\\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\), or both) were applied during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact series or types of transformations based solely on the end state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is not feasible, because different combinations of C and D can potentially yield the same final state due to possible overlapping effects in the matrix transformation paths.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation y(t) → y(T) represents the evolution of the system over time. The transformation Cz → g(z) and Dz → h(z) apply to the initial vector z at some point, potentially altering its state before it evolves into y(T). Knowing y(T) allows us to infer the effects of g(z) and h(z) on the initial vector z, but not necessarily which specific transformations were applied."
