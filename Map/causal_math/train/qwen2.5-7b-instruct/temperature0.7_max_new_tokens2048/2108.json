  "Problem": "Analyzing a system governed by a set of differential equations, \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and \\(u\\) represents an external control input related via the transformation \\\\(u(t) = D(t)z + E(t)\\) where D and E are matrix functions of time.\n\nKnowing the resultant state \\(z(T)\\), can we identify precisely whether transformations followed \\(u(t) = D(t)z + E(t)\\) throughout, or if and when they switched to \\(u(t) = G(t)z + H(t)\\), based solely on the outcome \\(z(T)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influence of matrix dynamic interactions for \\(u(t)\\) through \\(D(t)\\), \\(E(t)\\), G(t), and H(t) can lead to equivalent outcomes for different control input timelines and interventions. This makes it challenging, if not impossible, to disentangle the effect of the transformations unambiguously just from \\(z(T)\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(t) → z(T); D(t)z + E(t) → u(t); G(t)z + H(t) → u(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) is influenced by the control input u(t), which can be expressed either as D(t)z + E(t) or G(t)z + H(t). The specific form of u(t) used over time cannot be uniquely determined from z(T) alone."
