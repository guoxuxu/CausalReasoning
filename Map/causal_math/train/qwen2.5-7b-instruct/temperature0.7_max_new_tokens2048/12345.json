  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform on the function, defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\), can we reconstruct the exact original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any loss of information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is a bijective transformation for functions that meet certain conditions (like being square-integrable). Therefore, the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) can indeed be reconstructed exactly from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) using the Inverse Fourier Transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
