  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We analyze the impact of integral transformations using convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\) over the real number line.\n\nGiven the convolved function resulting from \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), can we perfectly reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over the complex plane without prior knowledge of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and given the irreversibility of convolution with a non-invertible kernel such as a Gaussian, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from the convolution result. Intrinsic ambiguities arise due to the loss of information during convolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) is transformed into a convolved function through convolution with g(t), and g(t) also influences the convolved function."
