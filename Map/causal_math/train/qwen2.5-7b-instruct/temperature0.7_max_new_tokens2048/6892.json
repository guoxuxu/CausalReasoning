  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the times and nature of any interventions (changes in the PDE parameters) used, if any?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform at T could result from various scenarios of parameter changes at different times, as long as the combined effect conforms to the observed \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\). Without additional information about the specific timing and nature of interventions, they cannot be uniquely identified.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion coefficient D influences the time derivative of u(x, t) and the second spatial derivative of u(x, t); these derivatives in turn define u(x, t); the Fourier transform of u(x, t) at time T is determined by the transformed function at other times."
