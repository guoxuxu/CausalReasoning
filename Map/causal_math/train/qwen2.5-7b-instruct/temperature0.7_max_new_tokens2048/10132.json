  "Problem": "Consider a differential operator \\\\( L[y] = \\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - y \\\\) operating in a complex function space. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) on functions that are solutions to the differential equation \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( T[M[y]](s) \\\\), can we determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( M[y] \\\\), \\\\( T[y] \\\\), or both) strictly from the knowledge of \\\\( T[M[y]](s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed function does not uniquely identify the sequence or types of interventions. The overlap in the Laplace domain expressions for various differential operators and functions can converge to indistinguishable results, making it unfeasible to uniquely back-calculate the specific interventions from the outcome alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
