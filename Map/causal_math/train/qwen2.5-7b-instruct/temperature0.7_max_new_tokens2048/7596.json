  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mx}u \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a constant matrix and x representing spatial variables.\n\nCan we determine exactly what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or both) solely by knowing the state \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity of interactions between the transformations \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\) and the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), multiple combinations of interventions could theoretically yield the same state \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\). Therefore, it's not feasible to precisely identify the interventions used based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(u) directly causes the state u(T, x) to change, and the linear differential operator L directly causes the rate of change of u with respect to time (∂u/∂t) to occur."
