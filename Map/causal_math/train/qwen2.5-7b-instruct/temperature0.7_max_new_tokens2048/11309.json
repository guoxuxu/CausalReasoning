  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. Consider the Laplace transform definition \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and evolves under its definition without additional transformation, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = b \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) be unique for a specific \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) distinctly depends on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\), yielding \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). This transform is uniquely determined by \\\\( a \\\\) for each \\\\( s \\\\) in the domain where the transform exists (\\\\( s > a \\\\)). The result does not change over time as it is a direct transformation, giving a unique \\\\( F(s) \\\\) corresponding to a given \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) = e^(at) transforms uniquely into F(s) through the Laplace transformation, given a specific value of a; the value of b does not directly cause a change in F(s) but specifies the point in the s-domain where F(s) is evaluated."
