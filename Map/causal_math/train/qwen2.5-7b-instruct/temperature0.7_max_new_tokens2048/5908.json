  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyse how this function transforms under the operation of a complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} f(x) dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[wz](s) \\\\) is a Dirac delta at \\\\( s = -1 \\\\), can we determine both the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and the nature of intervention (the function \\\\( w(x) \\\\)) precisely?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function being a Dirac delta function at \\\\( s = -1 \\\\) uniquely corresponds to the frequency \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\), indicating that the original function was altered by multiplying with \\\\( w(x) = e^{-2ix} \\\\). Since this modification shifts the original \\\\( z(x) \\\\) frequency by exactly -2, we can precisely deduce both the original and the intervening function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T applied to the product of w(x) and z(x) results in a Dirac delta function centered at s = -1, indicating that w(x)z(x) has a specific frequency component that the transform amplifies to a spike at s = -1."
