  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where ω is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. A Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(ω) = \\\\int_{-∞}^{∞} z(t) e^{-iωt} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform without any alteration in its functional form, will the transform \\\\( F(ω) \\\\) exhibit a delta function at frequency \\\\( ω \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the Fourier transform of sinusoidal functions, transforming \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) results in a delta function precisely at the original frequency \\\\( ω \\\\). This is characteristic of the Fourier transform's response to pure sinusoidal inputs.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
