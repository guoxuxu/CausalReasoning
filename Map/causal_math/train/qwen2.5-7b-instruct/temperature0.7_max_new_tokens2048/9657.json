  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\), where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a complex function. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\lambda s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(T) \\\\) directly evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by integrating the exponential function with \\\\( z(s) \\\\). This integration alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), influencing its evolution differently than if it were merely subject to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\). This is due to the non-linear impacts introduced by the integral transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the integral transformation g(z) at t=0 influences the state of z(t) which then evolves over time according to the differential equation p(t)z, leading to z(T) at t=T. Direct evolution of z(t) under the differential equation p(t)z from t=0 to t=T would result in a different z(T) due to the initial condition set by g(z)."
