  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant. We are analyzing the Julia set generated by this function and explore the behavior of points under iterative applications of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention occurs such as changing the function to \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c' \\\\) at some iteration \\\\( k \\\\), where \\\\( c' \\\\) is a different complex constant, will the final location of \\\\( z_n \\\\) still necessarily be within the original Julia set of \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constant in the function alters the generated Julia set. Consequently, a sequence starting under one function and switching to another could lead the sequence to exit the original Julia set, depending not only on the new constant \\\\( c' \\\\) but also on how the dynamics of the new function interplay with the starting point.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changing the constant from c to c' at iteration k alters the function from f to g, which in turn changes the trajectory of z_n to z'_n, potentially outside the original Julia set of f."
