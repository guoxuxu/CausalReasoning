  "Problem": "Investigate the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}w \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are complex constant matrices, considering the integral transformations over a time interval [0, T].\n\nIf \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is applied using the transformation on a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by evolving the system under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}w \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > 0 be equivalent to \\\\( e^{AT}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The composition of transformations specified by matrices A and B alters the evolution of the state from \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) involves the combined effects of both exponential transformations, not merely \\\\( e^{AT}z_0 \\\\), hence it would differ unless A and B are somehow related such that they negate each other's effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Given w(0) evolves to z(t) via z(t) = e^(At)w, and z(t) further evolves to z(T) via z(t) = e^(At)w, then for T > 0, z(T) will be equivalent to e^(AT)z_0."
