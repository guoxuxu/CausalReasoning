  "Problem": "In a control system, the output \\\\(z\\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz + Cu\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices controlling the system dynamics and input response, respectively, and \\\\(u\\\\) represents an external control input. Consider applying a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z(t)) = sZ(s) - z(0) \\\\), to analyze the system's behavior in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace-transformed system output \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) without control input, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\(Z(s) = (sI - D)^{-1}z(0)\\\\) from the scenario with \\\\(u = 0\\\\), and assuming \\\\((sI - D)\\\\) is invertible, we can multiply both sides by \\\\((sI - D)\\\\) to retrieve \\\\(z(0) = (sI - D)Z(s)\\\\), thus uniquely determining the initial state.",
