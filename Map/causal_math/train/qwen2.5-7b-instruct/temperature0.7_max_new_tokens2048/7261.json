  "Problem": "Assume there is a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are complex numbers. This function is applied iteratively in the context of complex dynamics, commonly used in generating Julia sets.\n\nIf \\\\( c \\\\) is held constant and the function is iteratively applied starting from an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), will the sequence \\\\( z_n \\\\) converge to a fixed point as \\\\( n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convergence properties depend not only on the value of \\\\( c \\\\) but also on the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Some values of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) might lead to periodically repeating sequences, others to escape to infinity, or to converge to attractors. Therefore, the outcome isn’t necessarily converging to a fixed point without specific conditions on \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
