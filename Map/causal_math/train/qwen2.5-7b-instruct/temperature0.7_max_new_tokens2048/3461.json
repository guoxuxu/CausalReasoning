  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is used to transform an initial condition in a spatial eigenfunction problem governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -Au + iBu \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition is transformed by \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and let to evolve according to the PDE, will the solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at some later time \\\\( T \\\\) solely depend on the initial application of \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(0) = e^{(A+iB)0} = 1 \\\\) does not change the initial condition, so the evolution under the PDE remains as it would without the transformation. However, since \\\\( z(t) \\\\) changes over time, the solution at time \\\\( T \\\\) also reflects the influence of both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), implicating evolution under complex behavior, not solely from \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
