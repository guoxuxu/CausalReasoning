  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine which transformations (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, relying solely on the final value?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations both modify the state in a non-trivial exponential manner linked to time, making it challenging to reverse engineer the specific transformations or sequence of transformations used. Multiple combinations of parameters (\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and their timings) might lead to the same final observed state due to the overlapping effects on growth, decay, and rotations induced in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(t) evolves over time to become z(T) under the influence of ω. Applying the transformation f(z) with parameter α changes z(T). Both z(t) and α are necessary to determine f(z), but knowing only z(T) is insufficient to precisely determine which transformations were applied."
