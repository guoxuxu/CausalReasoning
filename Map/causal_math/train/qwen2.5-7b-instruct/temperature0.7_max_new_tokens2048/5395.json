  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) representing wave propagation, where c is the wave speed. We explore the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to convert the spatial variable into the frequency domain.\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying an additional Fourier transform on the wave function at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and then reversing it immediately, will the final state of the wave function at time T be affected by such intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The double application of the Fourier transform (applying and then immediately reversing it) essentially leaves the state unchanged due to the transform's invertibility and linearity, thereby not affecting the wave function's propagation or final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
