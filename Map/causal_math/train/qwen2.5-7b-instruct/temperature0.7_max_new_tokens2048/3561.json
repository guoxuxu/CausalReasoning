  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents temperature distribution in a material and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To test the effect of a spatial transformation, let's apply a rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) to the spatial coordinates.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, y, 0) \\\\) undergoes a spatial transformation by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) and is then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the distribution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if no spatial transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) modifies the start distribution geometrical configuration, which changes how heat diffuses throughout the structure over time. This rotation can alter isotropy and symmetry properties of the initial condition, leading to a different temperature distribution at any later time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x, y, 0) evolves over time according to the heat equation governed by thermal diffusivity k, resulting in u(x, y, t). Applying a spatial transformation R(θ) to u(x, y, 0) before evolution does not change the fundamental behavior described by the heat equation, so the distribution u(x, y, t) will be equivalent whether or not the spatial transformation is applied."
