  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) on a rod extending from \\\\(x=0\\\\) to \\\\(x=L\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature at point \\\\(x\\\\) at time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\) and its modification via a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[f](k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx}dx\\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original temperature profile \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) perfectly from observing \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) if the Fourier transform was applied before the heat equation took effect?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the Fourier transformation and the solution to the heat equation, diffusive processes are inherently lossy with respect to information about the high-frequency components of the initial profile. This information loss prevents exact reconstruction of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, T); f(x) → u(x, 0); u(x, T) ← f(x)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution f(x) directly causes the temperature at time t=0, u(x, 0), which then evolves over time according to the heat equation to become u(x, T). Observing u(x, T) allows us to infer the original temperature profile f(x) through the inverse Fourier transform."
