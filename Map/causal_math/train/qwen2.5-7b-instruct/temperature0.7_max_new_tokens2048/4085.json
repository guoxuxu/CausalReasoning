  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) which is derived as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - A} \\\\), where A represents a constant. The system is studied under a Heaviside step function input \\\\( u(t) = 1(t) \\\\) converted into the Laplace domain to form \\\\( U(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\). The output in the Laplace domain is then \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the system runs with input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without any changes, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) always be determined solely by the parameters A in \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and system input?",
  "Explanation": "Since the input and the system's impulse response are defined clearly without changes, \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) which is the product of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( U(s) \\\\) will be determined by \\\\( A \\\\) and the input. The response is directly calculated from these given parameters without deviation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
