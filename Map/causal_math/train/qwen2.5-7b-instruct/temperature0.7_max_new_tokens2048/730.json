  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. Analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on the system, with respect to the control variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) from the Laplace transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) at a later time without intervening, given that the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the knowledge of linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and the system's description, plus the invertibility of the Laplace transform under certain conditions, one can recover \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\). The Laplace transform's ability to encode initial conditions into the frequency domain allows for this back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "s → L; L → u(t); u(t) → u(t+Δt); u(t) → u_0(t); u(t+Δt) → u_0(t+Δt); u_0(t) → hat{u}(s); hat{u}(s) → u_0(t+Δt)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control variable s influences the linear operator L, which in turn affects the function u(t). The function u(t) evolves over time to become u(t+Δt), and the initial condition u_0(t) leads to u_0(t+Δt). Applying the Laplace transform to u(t) yields hat{u}(s), which can be used to determine u_0(t+Δt) at a later time without further intervention."
