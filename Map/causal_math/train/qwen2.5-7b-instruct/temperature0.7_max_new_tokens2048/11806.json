  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\). We study the effect of transformations \\\\( g(x, y) = (x + 1, y + 1) \\\\) and their inverse on the function, along with an external forcive change in variable using the transformation \\\\( h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention transforming variables with \\\\( h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) \\\\) is applied at some point after \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\), will the final value of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) depend only on the original variables \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) fundamentally alters the input to \\\\( f \\\\) further, and the final value of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) will depend on the intermediate transformed values through \\\\( g \\\\), as well as the final transformation through \\\\( h \\\\). This results in a dependency both on the original and the intermediate variables.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
