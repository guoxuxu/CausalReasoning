  "Problem": "Consider the environment described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(w) = Aw + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants, on the evolution of this function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T(w) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then we let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolve naturally without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the transformation was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(w) \\\\) initially modifies the starting value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( A z(0) + B \\\\). The subsequent evolution under the function \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) will reflect this modified initial condition, leading to a different result at time T due to the complex shift and scaling by A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation T(z(0)) → z(T) changes the initial condition z(0) to a new state z(T), which differs from the natural evolution z(t) → z(T) without the transformation."
