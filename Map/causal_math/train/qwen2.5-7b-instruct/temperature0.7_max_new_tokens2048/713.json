  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where 'a' is a constant complex number. We explore the scenario under the Fourier transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an initial function form \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transformation, does this change the complexity or distribution property of the system in the frequency domain compared to a direct calculation of the transform from \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) yields a simple computation that reflects the intrinsic properties of the function in the frequency domain. This direct transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{a + i\\\\omega} \\\\), depending on 'a', already accounts for all characteristics of the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function form z(t) = e^{at} directly influences its Fourier transform \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\) through the integral transformation, while the constant complex number 'a' determines the nature of the exponential function, thus shaping the properties of the resulting frequency domain representation."
