  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real number representing frequency. Evaluate the transformation by applying the Laplace transform to z(t).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), then allowed to operate under its own algebra without further intervention, does the transformed function reach the same output as directly computing the Laplace transform of z(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform directly or allowing the algebra of Laplace operations to act on the transformed function will inherently result in the same output. This stems from the linearity and time-invariance properties of the Laplace transform, ensuring consistent outcomes from initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
