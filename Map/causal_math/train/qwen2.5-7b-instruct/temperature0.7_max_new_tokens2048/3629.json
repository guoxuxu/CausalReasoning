  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic form described by \\\\( Q(x) = x^T A x \\\\), where A is a symmetric matrix. We analyze the behavior of this form under a linear transformation defined by the matrix T over the vector space.\n\nWill the application of the transformation T to a vector x and then calculating \\\\( Q(x) \\\\) with the original matrix A, result in the same value as calculating \\\\( Q(Tx) \\\\) using the transformed A in the original space?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation T modifies the vector x to Tx and hence, when applying the quadratic form in the transformed space, i.e., \\\\( (Tx)^T A (Tx) \\\\), the outcome is generally different unless T commutes with A in a specific way (such as T being a scalar multiple of the identity matrix).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a linear transformation T to a vector x changes the quadratic form from Q(x) to Q(Tx) using the transformed matrix A' which is derived from A through T, thus Q(x) does not necessarily equal Q(Tx)."
