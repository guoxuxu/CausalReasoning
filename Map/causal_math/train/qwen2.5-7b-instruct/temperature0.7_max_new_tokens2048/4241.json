  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant scalar and \\\\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. We study the effect of the Laplace transform on this function over time interval \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) is calculated, does the existence of poles in the transform affect the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The calculation of the Laplace transform does not alter the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The presence of poles in the transform is merely a representation of the function's behavior in the frequency domain and does not affect the time-domain form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).",
