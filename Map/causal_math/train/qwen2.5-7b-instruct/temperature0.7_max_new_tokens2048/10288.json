  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the stability of a linear system defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and the dynamics of the system under matrix A, can we accurately determine the sequence and type of interventions (if any, such as \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)) applied during the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is the result of complex interactions between the applied interventions and the natural dynamics under A. Multiple different sequences of interventions (or even none) could lead to the same endpoint due to the non-commutativity and multiplicative effects of the exponential terms and the system matrix. Identifying the exact sequence or types of intervention solely from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not feasible without additional temporal information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
