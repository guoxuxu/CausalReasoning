  "Problem": "Consider a system undergoing complex function transformations governed by \\\\( z(t) = f(z), \\\\) where \\\\( f(z) = ze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant. We analyze how integral transformations like the Laplace transform affect the trajectory over time.\n\nGiven the trajectory observed at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations were applied (whether only \\\\( f(z) \\\\), only \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) based only on the result at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Each transformation modifies the phase in a specific way, and the resultant trajectory at \\\\( T \\\\) could be a product of either or both transformations applied at different times or sequences, complicating the isolation of specific effects and making it impossible to uniquely identify the type or sequence of transformations used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
