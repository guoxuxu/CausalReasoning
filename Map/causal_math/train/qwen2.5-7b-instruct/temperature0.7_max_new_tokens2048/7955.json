  "Problem": "Analyze causal inference in a system represented by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\lambda \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the system's state and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant speed. Additionally, consider the transformation \\\\( g(u) = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( h(u) = Mu \\\\) (where M is another linear operator) is applied, will the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the original PDE and \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without being influenced by L or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(u) = Mu \\\\) further modifies the state trajectory, thereby making \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) a result of the compounded effects of L, M, and the original PDE dynamics. Each linear operator could individually alter u’s propagation, making T's state dependent on both L and M as well as the PDE's parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x,0) → u(x,t) and the constant speed λ → u(x,t) determine the state u(x,T) through the PDE. An intervention h(u) = Mu at t_1 does not directly influence the final state u(x,T) if we consider only the PDE and the initial condition u_0(x)."
