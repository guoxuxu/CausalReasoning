  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and let's analyze its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( I[z](t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\).\n\nWith the transformation \\\\( I[z](t) \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to its definition without further modifications, will \\\\( I[z](t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation results in \\\\( I[z](t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\omega s} e^{i\\omega s} ds = \\int_{0}^{t} ds = t \\\\), and under the conditions given, since the negative exponent and exponent cancel each other, the effect of the transformation simplifies such that the integral over an entire cycle of a complex exponential equals zero due to periodic cancellation.",
