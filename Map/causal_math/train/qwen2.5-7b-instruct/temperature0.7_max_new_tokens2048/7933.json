  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in complex function theory, defined by the equation \\\\(Ax = \\\\lambda x\\\\), where A is a linear operator on a complex vector space, and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are the eigenvalues. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt\\\\) on the eigenvalues.\n\nIf the linear operator A is modified to \\\\(A + B\\\\) with small matrix B, and we apply the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\), will the dominant eigenvalue of the transformed system at time t reflect the perturbation introduced by B?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration in A by the addition of B subtly shifts the location of its eigenvalues. Consequently, the integral transformation incorporating \\\\(e^{(A+B)t}\\\\) will preserve this shift and impact the resulting dominant eigenvalue, showcasing the sensitivity of the transformation to changes in the operator.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
