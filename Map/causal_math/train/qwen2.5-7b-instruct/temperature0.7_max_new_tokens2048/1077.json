  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a periodic input signal \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the signal frequency. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + a y = bx \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n\nIf the input signal frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is doubled, will the steady-state amplitude of the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a much later time be affected without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the input frequency changes the form of the forcing function in the differential equation representing the circuit. This alteration affects the steady-state solution to the differential equation, specifically changing the amplitude response due to the frequency-dependent nature of the system's response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Doubling the input signal frequency ω directly affects the input signal x(t), which in turn influences the output y(t) through the constants a and b."
