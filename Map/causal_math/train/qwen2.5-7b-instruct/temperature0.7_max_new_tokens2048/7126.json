  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0 \\), commonly known as the wave equation, where \\( c \\) is the wave speed. The study focuses on the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-s^2x^2} u(x,t) \\, dx \\), where \\( s \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\( T(u(x,T)) \\) for some \\( t = T \\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\( u(x,0) \\) without knowing whether \\( T \\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T \\) integrates \\( u(x,t) \\) against a Gaussian, which can significantly alter distribution characteristics, such as peaks of \\( u(x,t) \\). Without knowing if \\( T \\) was applied, or the nature of its application (e.g., time and/or parameter \\( s \\)), it is infeasible to accurately trace back to \\( u(x,0) \\) as many different initial conditions could lead to the same transformed outcome at \\( t = T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the integral transformation T on the solution u at time T allows us to infer the initial function u(x,0), given that the wave speed c influences the form of u(x,t) which in turn determines u(x,0)."
