  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane dynamics described by the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ u(t) \\} = U(s) \\) of a temporal function \\( u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\). We study the effect of a convolution operator defined by \\( h(t) \\) over the signal \\( u(t) \\), resulting in \\( v(t) = (h * u)(t) \\).\n\nGiven \\( W(s) \\) observed at some endpoint, can we determine what specific type or sequence of interventions (whether by \\( h(t) \\), \\( g(t) \\), or both) was used, just by knowing \\( W(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( W(s) \\) being a product of multiple Laplace transforms (i.e., \\( W(s) = G(s)H(s)U(s) \\)) means that different combinations of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) could yield the same \\( W(s) \\). Therefore, it's impossible to uniquely backtrace the exact interventions or their sequence solely from \\( W(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal u(t) transforms to U(s) via the Laplace transform; the convolution of h(t) with u(t) produces v(t); the Laplace transform of v(t) is the product of U(s) and H(s), resulting in W(s)."
