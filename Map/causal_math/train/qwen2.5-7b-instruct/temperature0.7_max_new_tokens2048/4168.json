  "Problem": "Investigate a linear system governed by \\\\( dX = NX dt + M dW_t \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Wiener process (Brownian motion). We hypothesize a transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Kt} X \\\\) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) being another constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( X(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint the exact interventions used (whether \\\\( h(X) \\\\), \\\\( q(X) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( X(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity brought on by the stochastic nature of the driving process \\\\( W_t \\\\) and the compounded effects of the transformations \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Lt} \\\\), different combinations of transformations might yield the same final state. This overlap in potential outcomes makes it challenging to uniquely identify the specific interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
