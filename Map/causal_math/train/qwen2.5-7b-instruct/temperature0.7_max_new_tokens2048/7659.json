  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf an operation altering the frequency spectrum of input, denoted by multiplying \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) (where A is a complex number), is applied at \\\\( t=0 \\\\), does the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes the Fourier transform of the input signal to \\\\( X(\\\\omega - A) \\\\). Hence, the output spectrum will now be \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega - A) \\\\), which clearly shows dependence on both the system's response and the parameter \\\\( A \\\\) from the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
