  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the temperature \\( T \\) of a substance is related to its electrical resistance \\( R \\) through the equation \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( R_0 \\) are constants. An additional thermal experiment involves the application of a function \\( g(T) = T + \\Delta T \\), where \\( \\Delta T \\) is a constant temperature change.\n\nIf a temperature change to \\( T \\) is directly applied to a system initially at \\( R_0 \\), and \\( R(T) \\) develops according to \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\) without further intervention, will \\( R(T) \\) at a later time \\( T \\) be solely dependent on the initial temperature change?",
  "Explanation": "In this case, since \\( R(T) \\) is explicitly defined by \\( e^{aT} \\) and no other interventions are applied, the resulting electrical resistance is deterministically dependent only on the temperature \\( T \\) initially set, adhering strictly to the given resistance-temperature relationship.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
