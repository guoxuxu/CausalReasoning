  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a system matrix and B is a control matrix, coupled with a control input u. We analyze the impact of applying a state-dependent transformation \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\( dx/dt = Ax \\\\) without any further input (\\\\( u = 0 \\\\)), will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( dx/dt = Ax \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Cx_0 \\\\). The solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will evolve from this new initial state according to the system dynamics given by A, which in general results in a different state at time T compared to the evolution of the original \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(x) = Cx to the initial state x_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under the dynamics A → x(t) for time T results in the same state x(t) at t=T as directly evolving x_0 under the dynamics A → x(t) for the same time period."
