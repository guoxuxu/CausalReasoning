  "Problem": "Study the effect of a complex function \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\) on a real variable \\\\( x \\\\) and its integration relating to the Fourier transform of a signal \\\\( s(t) \\), represented as \\\\( S(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} s(t) e^{-i2\\pi f t} dt. \\\\)\n\nDoes the application of the transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\) to \\\\( x \\\\) affect the Fourier transform of \\\\( s(t) \\\\) if \\\\( s(t) \\\\) is a strictly real function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the complex function \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) to a real variable introduces a phase shift, converting \\\\( x \\\\) into a complex exponential, which will affect the nature of the Fourier transform. This impact is through altering the spectral characteristics by introducing imaginary components in the signal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation z → e^(iz) to x influences z, which in turn affects the Fourier transform of s(t) through the relationship s(t) → S(f). Since s(t) is a strictly real function, the transformation impacts the phase of the Fourier components of s(t)."
