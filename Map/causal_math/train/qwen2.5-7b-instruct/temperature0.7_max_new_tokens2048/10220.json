  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of the integral with the integrand \\\\(z + e^{z^2}/(z-a)\\\\), can we conclusively determine that an intervention modified the original \\\\(1/(z-a)\\\\), by knowing just the result of the intervened integral?",
  "Explanation": "The result of an integral post-intervention, especially with additional or altered complex functions, cannot conclusively determine what the original function or contour was. The complexity introduced by additions such as \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\) masks the original function characteristics, making definitive backward inference inaccurate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function f(z) = e^(z^2) modifies the integrand from 1/(z-a) to z + e^(z^2)/(z-a), which in turn influences the integral result. An intervention changing the integrand to z + e^(z^2)/(z-a) affects the intervened integral result."
