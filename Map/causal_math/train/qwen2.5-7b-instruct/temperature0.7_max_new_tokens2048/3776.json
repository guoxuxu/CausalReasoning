  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\), can we uniquely ascertain both the value of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and whether \\\\( G(k) \\\\) was applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The temporal evolution of the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) values and applications of \\\\( G(k) \\\\). Different scenarios could yield similar or indistinguishable transformed outcomes at time T due to the overlapping influence of damping and propagation characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "U_{xx} → -λU; λ → G(k); G(k) → \\hat{U}(k, t); \\hat{U}(k, T) → λ; \\hat{U}(k, T) → G(k)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The second spatial derivative of U with respect to x (-λU) determines the form of U, which through Fourier transformation leads to the behavior of \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\). Applying G(k) modifies \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and knowing \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) allows inferring both λ and whether G(k) was applied."
