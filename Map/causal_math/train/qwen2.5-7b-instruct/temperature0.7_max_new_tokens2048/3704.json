  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, and an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to it. Analyze how identifying causal relations in such a context might be impacted by the properties of the function and transformation.\n\nCan we determine the exact nature of the intervention (specifically the value of \\\\( k \\\\)) applied to the function \\\\( h \\\\) by analyzing \\\\( T[j](s) \\\\) where \\\\( j(x, y) = k \\\\cdot h(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact nature of the intervention, such as the value of \\\\( k \\\\), solely from the transformed output is generally not feasible. The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) can aggregate and modify the function's features to the extent that specific details of scaling by \\\\( k \\\\) are obscured, especially without precise knowledge of the behavior of \\\\( h \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
