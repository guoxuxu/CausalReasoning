  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the current state is modified by a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear function. The linear transformation is represented by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the nonlinear function is \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the state vector in a complex function space.\n\nCan we deduce whether the intervention was by \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or combinations thereof from the final state observed at \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state could be reached through several potential paths due to the interplay of linear transformations and the nonlinear effect of \\\\( h \\\\). The nonlinearity introduced by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and potential similarities in transformations by \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) can mask the specific impacts, making it difficult to decipher the exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M linearly transforms the state, N (another transformation matrix) may also transform the state, and h applies a nonlinear function to the state."
