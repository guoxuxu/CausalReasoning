  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\), where we transform the coordinates according to the functions \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = e^{Bt}y_0 \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. We analyze the dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\) over time under these transformations.\n\nIf an intervention alters the functions at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) such that \\\\( x(t) = x_1' = e^{Ct}x_1 \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = y_1' = e^{Dt}y_1 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be influenced only by A and B, disregarding C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation factors \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) introduces new dynamics to the system, significantly affecting the values of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) post-intervention. Hence, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, C, and D due to these compositional effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z is determined by the values of x and y through the equation z = x^2 + y^2. The transformations x(t) and y(t) influence z over time, but after the intervention at t1, only the constants A and B affect z for T > t1, assuming C and D do not have a direct effect on the ongoing transformation post-intervention."
