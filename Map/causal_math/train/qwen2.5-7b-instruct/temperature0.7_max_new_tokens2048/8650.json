  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). This system deals with an input signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over time t, where the output signal \\\\( F(s) \\\\) represents the system's response in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) in the frequency domain, can we infer that the input was definitely the unit step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) strongly suggests a step function input, it's theoretically possible for other modified or piecewise functions to lead to the same transform result in specific contexts. Therefore, it's not definitive without additional information about the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = 1/s is f(t) = u(t), indicating that if the output in the frequency domain is F(s) = 1/s, the input signal in the time domain could be the unit step function u(t)."
