  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex plane, described by the relation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Consider the effect spatially shifting this function using another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + Ce^{Bt} \\\\), where B and C are constant complex numbers.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 + Ce^{B*0} \\\\). This addition of \\\\( C \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the outset; hence, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ from the trajectory of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) subjected to \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0, through the exponential growth factor e^(At), determines z(t). The parameters A and t directly influence z(t). The constants C and B determine the transformation h(z), which is independent of the evolution of z(t) unless applied at specific times. t also influences h(z) as it specifies when the transformation is applied."
