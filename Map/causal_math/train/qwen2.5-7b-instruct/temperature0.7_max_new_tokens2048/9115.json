  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) ds\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is an input function altering the state. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(u) = Cu\\\\), where C is a constant matrix transformation applied to the input.\n\nIf a further transformation \\\\(g(u) = Du\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(y(T)\\\\) be determined solely by matrix A and not affected by matrices B, C, or D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of another transformation \\\\(g(u)\\\\) introduces additional modifications to the input, making the system's output at time T reliant not only on A but also on the cumulative and possibly non-commutative effects of matrices B, C, and D through their modification of the input function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
