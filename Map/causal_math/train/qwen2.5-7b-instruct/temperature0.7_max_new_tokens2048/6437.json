  "Problem": "Consider a system where a temperature field T is modeled by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplace operator. We investigate the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + h(x,t) \\\\), with \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) being a heat source function varying in space and time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(T) \\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( T_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(T) \\\\) to modify the initial temperature distribution consequently alters the heat diffusion trajectory. Since \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) adds additional heat at various points, the evolved temperature distribution differs from the scenario without this addition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution T_0 directly influences the temperature T through the evolution equation. Applying the transformation f(T) to T_0 results in a new temperature field which then evolves according to the PDE, leading to T. The parameters k and Δ directly cause changes in T through the PDE."
