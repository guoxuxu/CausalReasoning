  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nIf at \\\\( z_2 \\\\), an operation \\\\( g(w) = e^{Bw} \\\\) (where B is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of the system at \\\\( z_1 \\\\) for \\\\( z_1 > z_2 \\\\) compute as if only the \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) was integral transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of applying \\\\( g(w) \\\\) at \\\\( z_2 \\\\) alters the problem setup significantly. While the original system was affected only by way of A, the introduction of B at a mid-point introduces another layer of complexity, making the behavior dependent on both A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T[f](z) applied to w(z) = e^(Az) results in a function that, when intervened with g(w) = e^(Bw) at z_2, affects the state at z_1 > z_2 as if only the original transformation e^(Az) was applied, given the intervention occurs after the initial transformation."
