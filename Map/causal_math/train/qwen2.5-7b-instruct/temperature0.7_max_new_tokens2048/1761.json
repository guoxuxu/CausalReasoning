  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, under the application of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). We analyze how interventions by multiplication of a complex exponential factor affect causal inference in this complex waveform scenario.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any intervention modify the outcome in the s-domain compared to directly transforming the initial function at time t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) directly computes to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{iwt}) = \\\\frac{1}{s-iw} \\\\). The transformation is deterministic and linear, thus transforming the function at t=0 or at any later time without modification leads to the same result in the s-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
