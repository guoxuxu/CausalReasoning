  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state vector. We investigate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix, applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) throughout the timeline?",
  "Explanation": "The interpretation of interventions leading to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be ambiguous because different sequences and combinations of transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) can mimic each other's effects when they work concurrently with the system dynamics under matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The non-unique effects of matrix exponentials further complicate the unambiguous determination of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0, through the dynamics defined by matrix A and constant C, influences the state z(t). The transformation h(z) defined by matrix D at time t_0 affects the state z(T). Since both transformations h(z) and k(z) can contribute to the final state z(T), knowing only z_0, A, C, D, t_0, z(t), and z(T) is insufficient to conclusively determine which specific transformations were applied throughout the timeline."
