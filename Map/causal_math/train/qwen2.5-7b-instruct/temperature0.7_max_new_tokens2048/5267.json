  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\), where L is a differential operator. Consider how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system's behavior.\n\nIf during the evolution at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention is applied via a filtering function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), affecting the system as \\\\( u(x,t_1) = h(x) * u(x,t_1) \\\\), will the eventual state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the form of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) during the system's evolution modifies the state at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), in turn affecting all subsequent states. The Fourier transform of the convolution, \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(k) \\\\hat{u}(k,t_1) \\\\), indicates that the changed \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t_1) \\\\) influences the final transformed state, making it dependent on the form of \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x,t) evolves over time through the operator L to become u(x,t+dt), which eventually leads to u(x,t_1). Applying a filtering function h(x) at t_1 modifies u(x,t_1) to become h(x) * u(x,t_1). This modification propagates through the evolution process governed by L to affect the final state \\\\hat{u}(k,T) for T > t_1."
