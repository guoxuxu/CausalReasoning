  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\), affects the function and the implications of different transformations.\n\nIf an additional transformation defined by multiplying \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by \\\\(e^{ct}\\\\) (where \\\\(c\\\\) is a real constant) is applied before taking the Laplace transform, will the pole of the resulting function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{ct}z(t))(s)\\\\) be solely influenced by \\\\(c\\\\) and not by \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the original function to \\\\(e^{ct}z(t) = e^{(a+c+bi)t}\\\\), and its Laplace transform, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{ct}z(t))(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+c+bi)}\\\\), has a pole at \\\\(s = a+c+bi\\\\), clearly influenced by \\\\(a\\\\), \\\\(b\\\\), and \\\\(c\\\\). Thus, the pole's location depends on all three parameters.",
