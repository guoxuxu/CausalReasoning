  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where a system is transformed by the matrix function \\\\( f(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is an invertible matrix. The system's behavior and outcomes are then studied under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is another matrix, to observe the evolution of the system over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly subjected to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(x) = Mx \\\\) changes the starting point of the system, affecting its evolution under \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\\\). Since \\\\( MN \\\\) might not equal \\\\( NM \\\\), the order of applying these transformations may not be interchangeable, influencing the outcome at time T differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation M to the initial state x_0 at t=0 results in the state x(t) at time t. Directly applying the transformation N to the initial state x_0 at t=T results in the state x(T) at time T."
