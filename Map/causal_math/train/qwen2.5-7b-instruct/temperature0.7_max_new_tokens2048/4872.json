  "Problem": "Let's consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the system's response under the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) for a constant k.\n\nKnowing only the value of \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely the sequence of transformations applied (whether \\\\(g(x)\\\\) at t = 0, \\\\(h(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\), or both) to reach this endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "The final position \\\\(x(T)\\\\) may correspond to multiple possible transformation sequences due to the similarities in how exponential scaling interacts with the harmonic oscillator. This similarity makes it impossible to uniquely determine whether one or both transformations were applied, or in which sequence, based solely on the final position.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Knowing x(T) allows us to determine the effect of g(x) or h(x) on the system, but it does not specify the exact sequence of transformations applied."
