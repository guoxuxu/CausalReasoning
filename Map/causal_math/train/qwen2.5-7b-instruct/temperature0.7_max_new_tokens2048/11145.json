  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations expressed as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a linear transformation in a vector space. A specific operator \\\\(T(x) = e^{Mt}x\\\\) is applied, with M being another linear matrix, affecting x through an exponential transformation.\n\nIf \\\\(T(x) = e^{Mt}x\\\\) is used to transform initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, and the transformed vector is then processed under \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without further intervention, will the solution vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T match the one that would have been obtained by applying \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) directly to \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) modifies \\\\(x_0\\\\) before the system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) applies, leading to a different starting condition. Since \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) changes the components of the vector in a way specific to M, the resultant vector at time T will differ from that evolved directly from \\\\(Ax = b\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator T(x) = e^(Mt)x transforms the initial vector x(0) over time, resulting in x(t). The transformation x(t) is then processed by the linear equation Ax = b, leading to the solution vector x(t). This process implies that without further intervention, the solution vector x(t) at time t will be influenced by both the transformation T and the linear equation A."
