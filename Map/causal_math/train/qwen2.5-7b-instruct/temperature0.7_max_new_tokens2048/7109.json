  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) each satisfy the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y \\\\) with different parameters \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\). We explore using a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its impact on interpreting frequency components.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), will the resulting function in the frequency domain, represented as \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\), predominantly show peaks at frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega_v \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which includes both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), will show major frequency peaks exactly at \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\) due to each component's pure sinusoidal nature as dictated by the differential equation. Each component transforms to a delta function centered at its respective \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
