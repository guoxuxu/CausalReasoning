  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u(x, t), resulting in \\\\(U(k, t)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\) is calculated at t = 0, and u(x,t) evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\(U(k, T)\\\\) at t = T directly correspond to the evolution of \\\\(U(k, 0)\\\\) under the transformation induced by L in the Fourier space?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the differential operator L is transformed appropriately into the Fourier space, the evolution of \\\\(U(k, t)\\\\) from \\\\(U(k, 0)\\\\) is direct and governed by the Fourier transform of L. The initial state after transformation dictates the progression uniquely under the differential operation in the transformed space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x,0) → U(k,0); U(k,0) → U(k,T); U(k,0) → dU(k,t)/dt; dU(k,t)/dt → U(k,T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) transforms via the Fourier transform to U(k,0), which then evolves over time according to the differential operator L, leading to U(k,T). The rate of change of U(k,t) over time directly influences its value at t=T."
