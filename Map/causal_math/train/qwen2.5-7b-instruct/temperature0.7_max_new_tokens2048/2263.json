  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over an interval [0, t].\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) is introduced and integrated in a similar manner to T at time t = T/2, does the resulting function exclusively depend on the immediate effects of \\\\( T \\\\) and not on the subsequent effects of \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a new transformation like \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at T/2 introduces additional dynamics to the evolving function. It affects how the function develops beyond this point, including its behavior at T. Both the effects of \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) contribute to the outcome, thus we cannot consider the result depending only on \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(t) is influenced by the transformation T(z) through the integral definition, but it does not depend on the subsequent effects of g itself."
