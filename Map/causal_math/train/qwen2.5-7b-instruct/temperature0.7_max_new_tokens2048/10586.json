  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation system given by \\\\( y = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. We investigate the change in outcome when a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is applied to the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after observing the Laplace transform of the convolution \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x * h\\}(s) \\\\) without knowing the convolution was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the convolution by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), the transformed signal \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x * h\\}(s) \\\\) cannot be uniquely decomposed back to \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x\\}(s) \\\\) without additional information because multiple functions could result in the same product in the s-domain.",
