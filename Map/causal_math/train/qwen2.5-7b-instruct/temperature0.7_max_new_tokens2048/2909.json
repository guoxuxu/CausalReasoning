  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transform \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. This scenario explores both the direct evolution of the function and the impact of modifications through an operational function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is implemented on a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) and then the transformed function is subjected to \\\\( T \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( T(f(z_0))(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as \\\\( T(z_0)(t) \\\\) evolved directly at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the original function by morphing it with the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), which alters the input of the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\). This leads to different integration results since the transformation adaptively changes the function's values over the interval [0, T].",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z_0(t) is transformed by f(z) resulting in f(z_0)(t), which is then integrated by T to produce T(f(z_0))(t). Directly applying f(z) to z_0(t) before integrating with T yields a different result than applying T directly to z_0(t)."
