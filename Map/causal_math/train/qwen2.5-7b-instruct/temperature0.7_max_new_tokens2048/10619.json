  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where z is a complex-valued function of a real variable t, and A is a constant complex square matrix. We evaluate causal relationships and transformations involving the perturbation function \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation application at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), applying \\\\( C \\\\) to \\\\( z(t_1) = e^{At_1}z_0 \\\\) to get \\\\( z(t_1) = Ce^{At_1}z_0 \\\\), introduces additional complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is affected by both the original and the intervened transformations, yielding \\\\( z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}(Ce^{At_1}z_0) \\\\), showing a dependence on both the initial condition and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial transformation A → z(t) does not directly affect z(T) when g(z) = Cz is applied at t_1; instead, t_1 → g(z) and t_1 → z(T) indicate that the state z(T) depends on the intervention g(z) at t_1."
