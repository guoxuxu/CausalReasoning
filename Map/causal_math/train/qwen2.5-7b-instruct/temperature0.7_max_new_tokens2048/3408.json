  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nGiven a final Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied, and in what sequence?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) shows the cumulative phase shift, but does not provide information on the sequence or individual contributions of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Both transformations affect the phase spectrum uniformly, and without additional temporal information, the individual and sequential effects cannot be uniquely determined from the final Fourier transform alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a phase shift transformation h(z) = e^(iθ)z to z(t) results in a modified Fourier transform Z(ω). Similarly, applying another transformation g(z) results in Z(ω). The sequence of applying h(z) followed by g(z) or vice versa also influences Z(ω)."
