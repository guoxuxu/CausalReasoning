  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a wave propagating in space and time. We analyze this system after performing a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) in the frequency domain at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\) without knowing it was subjected to the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution derived from the differential equation in the frequency domain provides a one-to-one mapping from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) back to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\). The properties of the Fourier transformation and the linear character of the PDE allow reverse calculation directly.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The partial derivative of u with respect to time (u_t) being zero implies the partial derivative of u with respect to space (u_x) is also zero. The Fourier transform of u over space results in \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\), and the state of \\( \\hat{u}(k,T) \\) at time T allows us to infer the initial state \\( \\hat{u}(k,0) \\) without additional information."
