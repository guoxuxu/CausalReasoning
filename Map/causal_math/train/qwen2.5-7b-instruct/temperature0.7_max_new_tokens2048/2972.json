  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal influence under a system governed by a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\). Suppose this system evolves through different transformations and interventions represented by high-order derivatives in the spectral domain, specifically considering how various filters influence the signal.\n\nGiven the system's output at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) and knowing an intervention was applied, can it be conclusively determined what type and when the intervention (i.e., specific damping or derivative operations) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions could potentially lead to the same output at \\\\( t_2 \\\\), and it's impossible to uniquely back-calculate these interventions due to superposition and non-uniqueness issues in the inverse Laplace transform in presence of such filters or modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) is transformed into its Laplace representation, which then undergoes high-order derivatives. An intervention influences these high-order derivatives, which in turn affect the system's output at t_2."
