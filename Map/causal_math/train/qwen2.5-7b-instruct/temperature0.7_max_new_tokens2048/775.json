  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), in which z is a complex variable, A is a real number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The transformation applies to study the effect of rotations in the complex plane under different time transformations.\n\nAssuming an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) which modifies A to B in the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iBt}z(t_1) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on B for \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), ignoring earlier values?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 will be affected by both the initial phase rotation determined by A up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the subsequent modification to B from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. It is thus dependent on both parameters, A and B, reflecting compounded rotational effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → z(t); A → z(t_1); B → z(t) for t > t_1; z_0 → z(t); z_0 → z(t_1); t_1 → z(t) for t > t_1",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of A determines z(t) up to t_1, while B determines z(t) for t > t_1; z_0 provides the initial condition for z(t) and z(t_1); t_1 marks the transition from A's influence to B's influence."
