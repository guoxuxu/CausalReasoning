  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} =  L u \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We inspect the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} u(x, t) \\\\, dt \\\\), which is the Laplace transform of \\\\( u \\\\) with respect to time.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( F(u) \\\\) observed at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we deterministically define whether the intervention \\\\( G(u) \\\\) was applied at some \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), solely based on \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple natural or intervention-induced trajectories could result in the same transformed output due to the non-injective nature of such integral transformations; thus, identical outputs in \\\\( F(u) \\\\) do not necessarily imply identical pre-transform and/or intervention scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear differential operator L on u(x, t) directly causes the change in u with respect to time (L u → ∂u/∂t). The Laplace transform F(u) of u(x, t) with respect to time directly depends on u(x, t) (F(u) → u(x, t)). An intervention G(u) influences the value of F(u) at time T (G(u) → F(u)) but cannot be uniquely determined from F(u) at T alone without additional information."
