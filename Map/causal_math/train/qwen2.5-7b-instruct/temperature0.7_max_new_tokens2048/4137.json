  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{mt} \\\\\\) where \\\\( m \\\\) is a complex number, evolving in a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a real constant. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{nt}z \\\\), applied at different times, where \\\\( n \\\\) is another complex number.\n\nIf function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be different at time T as compared to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation modifies the starting condition of the differential equation. Since \\\\( e^{nt} \\\\) affects the scale and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it changes the trajectory, resulting in a different solution at time T compared to the unmodified case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly causes z(t). The parameter m directly causes z(t). The parameter k directly causes z'(t). The transformation n directly causes f(z). The time t directly causes f(z) and z(T). Applying f(z) at t=0 transforms z_0 and this transformation, along with the differential equation, determines z(T)."
