  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + au_x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nCan the occurring interventions (change from \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(b\\\\)) be conclusively determined by examining \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple configurations of \\\\(a\\\\), \\\\(b\\\\), and \\\\(t_1\\\\) can yield equivalent end states \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) due to the linearity and superposition in the solution processes, one cannot uniquely determine the nature or timing of interventions merely by observing the end state. The problem lacks sufficient information to infer the specifics of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of 'a' directly influences both 'u_t' and 'u_x'. Consequently, 'u(x,t)' evolves over time to become 'u(x,T)', and changes in 'a' affect the Fourier transform of 'u', denoted as 'Fourier_transform(u)(k,t)'."
