  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) applied to a constant vector \\( v \\) in the complex plane, where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex matrix. This scenario studies the effect of the function and the impact of an applied integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\, dt \\), with \\( B \\) being another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan the original vector \\( v \\) be uniquely determined by observing \\( z(T) = e^{AT}v \\) and knowing \\( A \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( z(T) = e^{AT}v \\) and \\( A \\), \\( v \\) can be exactly recovered by computing \\( v = e^{-AT}z(T) \\), assuming \\( A \\) is non-singular. The invertibility of \\( e^{AT} \\) allows for the precise reconstruction of \\( v \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
