  "Problem": "Imagine a complex dynamic pattern governed by the linear differential equation system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The behavior is significantly altered by an integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt} x(t') dt' \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and t spans from 0 to a finite time T.\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation \\\\( U(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 solely depend on L?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an intervention such as \\\\( U(x) \\\\) modifies the state trajectory by superimposing the effect of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\). The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will therefore be influenced by N, as well as L and potentially M from the prior transformation, altering the expected outcome from just the L dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
