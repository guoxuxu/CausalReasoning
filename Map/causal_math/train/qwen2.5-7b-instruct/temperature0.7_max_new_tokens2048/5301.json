  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant thermal diffusivity. Examine the impact of applying a transformation with the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which introduces a new component that evolves differently under the heat equation. Thus, the state of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T will differ due to the influence of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) on the transformation dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(u) with matrix A to the initial condition u(x, 0) at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under the heat equation leads to u(x, T) at t=T, which is different from directly evolving u(x, 0) to t=T under the heat equation."
