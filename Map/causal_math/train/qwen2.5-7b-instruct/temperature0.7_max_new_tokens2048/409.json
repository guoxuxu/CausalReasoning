  "Problem": "We investigate a signal processing system characterized by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system governed by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = h(t) * x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system’s impulse response and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied to the signal defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) by a factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and allowed to process through the system without further intervention, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be affected by the modification after applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the input signal by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) alters the frequency components of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), affecting the Fourier transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Since the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the modified \\\\( x(t) \\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will consequently be different, illustrating a direct causal impact from the modification of the input signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "x(t) → y(t); h(t) → y(t); x(t) → hat{x}(ω); y(t) → hat{y}(ω); x(t) * e^(αt) → y(t); hat{x}(ω) → hat{y}(ω)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) modified by e^(αt) directly causes the output y(t) to change, which in turn affects the Fourier transform of the output hat{y}(ω). The system's impulse response h(t) and the original Fourier transform of the input hat{x}(ω) also influence the output and its Fourier transform."
