  "Problem": "Consider assessing the stability of a system described by a Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\frac{U(s)}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants and \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is a known function in the s-domain. We evaluate the effect of the inverse Laplace transform given by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{Y(s)\\\\} \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the observed response \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T after an intervention, can we conclusively determine whether the intervention was the application of \\\\( U(s) = e^{-st} \\\\), just by examining \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed response at a single point in time, \\\\( y(T) \\\\), does not provide enough information to definitively identify the intervention, especially when other variables such as a and b also influence the response. Changes in these parameters could mimic or mask the effects of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of U(s) influences Y(s), which in turn determines y(t) over time t."
