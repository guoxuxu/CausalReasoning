  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined on the real axis, \\\\( u(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is transformed using the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v(t) = u(t)e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, and then the Laplace transform is applied, will the result be independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the function to \\\\( v(t) = e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha) t} \\\\). Applying the Laplace transform yields \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(v)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\), which clearly still depends on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The transformed output is a function of both the original frequency and the intervention parameter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation of \\( u(t) \\) to \\( v(t) \\) modifies the input of the Laplace transform, resulting in a new output \\( G(s) \\) which is dependent on both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\alpha \\), thus not independent of \\( \\omega \\)."
