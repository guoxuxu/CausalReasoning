  "Problem": "Assume a process where a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) undergoes a transformation under a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), which acts as \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants in the complex plane. Consider the effect of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we accurately backtrack the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after its transformation at time \\\\( T \\\\) only utilizing the knowledge of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) treatment and final state, without knowing about \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( L \\\\) modifies the trajectory in such a manner that without its knowledge, reversing the effects uniquely of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alone will not accurately yield the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The challenge arises because the effects of complex linear transformations involve shifts and scalings that are not retrievable in a unique manner from the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
