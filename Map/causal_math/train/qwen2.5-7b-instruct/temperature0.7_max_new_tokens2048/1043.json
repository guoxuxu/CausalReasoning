  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) representing the impulse response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is \\\\( H(s) \\\\). We consider the impact of a convolution operation using a step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) (Heaviside function) on the system's output y(t).\n\nIf an additional filtering process represented by a transfer function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is introduced after \\\\( t_0 \\\\), modifying the output further, would the final system output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), be solely determined by the convolution with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), ignoring \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another system modifier, \\\\( G(s) \\\\), means that the overall system behavior is not solely determined by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) anymore. Post-convolution, the filtering action of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) affects the final output, adding another layer of transformation which modifies \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "h(t) → H(s); u(t) → y(t); H(s) * u(t) → Y(s); G(s) → Y(s)_filtered; Y(s) * G(s) → Y(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of h(t) is H(s), u(t) convolves with h(t) to produce Y(s), which then filters through G(s) to become Y(s)_filtered, and finally, the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s)_filtered gives y(t)."
