  "Problem": "Let's consider a linear partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to this equation, and subsequently manipulating the transformed equation.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation (let's say, a Laplace transform) is applied as an intervention to the transformed equation, and then, the equation is solved further, will the solution at time T be independent of the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation shifts the domain and the structure of the equation even if temporarily, thus affecting the final solution. The use of different integral transforms can lead to different handling of initial and boundary conditions, affecting the endpoint at time T.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transform (F(u)) to the PDE results in a transformed equation, which, when further manipulated (transformation → manipulated_equation), leads to a solution at time T (manipulated_equation → solution_T). The initial Fourier transform (initial_Fourier_transform → transformed_equation) is a step in this process but does not affect the independence of the final solution (solution_T) from it."
