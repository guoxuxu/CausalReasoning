  "Problem": "Consider the linear operator \\\\(L[\\\\cdot]\\\\) defined as \\\\(L[x] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt\\\\), often known as the Laplace Transform. We investigate different manipulations involving a second operator \\\\(M[\\\\cdot]\\\\) defined by \\\\(M[x] = x(t-a)\\\\) for some constant \\\\(a > 0\\\\), which is a time-delay transformation.\n\nIf a corrective transformation \\\\(N[\\\\cdot]\\\\) defined by undoing the delay (\\\\(N[x] = x(t+a)\\\\)) is applied after the delay \\\\(M[x]\\\\) and before applying the Laplace Transform, will the final result be affected by the initial delay?",
  "Explanation": "The corrective transformation \\\\(N[\\\\cdot]\\\\), which shifts the function back by the same amount as \\\\(M[\\\\cdot]\\\\)'s delay, perfectly cancels out the effect of the delay when applied correctly before \\\\(L[\\\\cdot]\\\\). Thus, \\\\(L[N[M[x]]] = L[x]\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the delay transformation M[x] followed by the corrective transformation N[x] results in the original function x(t), which when transformed by L results in the same Laplace Transform as the original function."
