  "Problem": "We consider a mathematical model where two complex variables, z and w, are related via the transform \\( f(z) = ze^{iw} \\) at an initial time t = 0. Over time, w evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\), with A being a complex constant. We examine the influence of an early intervention at a time \\( t_1 \\) defined by the function \\( g(w) = w + C \\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\) without intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was evolved to t = T under \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(z) \\) introduces a dependency of z on w through the exponential term, which changes how z evolves due to changes in w. Since \\( w(t) \\) evolves differently due to A, the evolution of z also differs.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at t=0 influences f(z) which in turn determines z(t). The evolution of w over time, governed by dw/dt = Aw, directly influences f(z) and thus z(t). An early intervention at time t1, changing w to w + C, affects w. The constant A determines the rate of change of w. Without intervention, z(t) at time T is the same as evolving z0 under dw/dt = Aw alone."
