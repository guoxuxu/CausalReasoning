  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = L(h(t))  = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). We analyze the effect of modifying this system by convolution with another function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing whether convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the alteration caused by the shift in Laplace transform domain makes it challenging to reliably trace back and reconstruct \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\), as the original properties are obscured.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform H(s) of h(t) is 1/(s-a), G(s) of g(t) is 1/(s-b), and their convolution in the frequency domain results in Y(s). Inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) gives y(t), which is the result after possible convolution with g(t). Knowing Y(s) allows deduction of h(t) at t=0 if no convolution with g(t) occurred."
