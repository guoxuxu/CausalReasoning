  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), with M being a constant matrix. We examine the system's behavior under the influence of a linear operator \\\\(h(z) = Sz\\\\), where S is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a different linear operator \\\\(k(z) = Rz\\\\) (where R is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depend only on the original matrix M and not on S or R?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\(k(z)\\\\) as an intervention modifies the path according to the new initial condition \\\\(Rz(t_1)\\\\). The eventual state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on M, S, and R due to their impact on the trajectory and the state transformations through interaction effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(t) is directly influenced by the matrix M through the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\). The operators h(z) and k(z) do not directly influence z(t)'s evolution governed by M, though they may affect the initial conditions or external inputs to the system."
