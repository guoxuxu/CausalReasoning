  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system in a complex plane under the influence of an external force and initial conditions. The position of a particle in the complex plane is described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the position, respectively, in time t. The position is further affected by the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nHaving observed the position \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T, is it possible to infer the initial position \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied, the initial condition could be one of multiple possible states resulting from different angular displacements imparted by the transformation \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), complicating backward calculation to \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
