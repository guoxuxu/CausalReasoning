  "Problem": "Consider a system given by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) represents an input function to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) at different time points on system behavior.\n\nGiven the final system output at time T, \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we infer the initial state at t = 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(y) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge about the application of the transformation \\\\( h(y) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately deduce the initial state at t = 0. The transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) can significantly modify the initial output, obscuring any direct inference of the initial conditions purely based on observation at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function u(t) and the constant matrix A directly cause the system output y(t) at any time t. The transformation h(y) applied at time T affects the system output y(T). Knowing y(T) does not allow inferring the initial state at t=0 without information about h(y) being applied initially."
