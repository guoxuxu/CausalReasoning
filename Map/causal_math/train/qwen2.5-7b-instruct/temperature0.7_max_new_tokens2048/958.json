  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BdW \\\\), where \\\\( W(t) \\\\) is a standard Brownian motion and A, B are matrices. Let's analyze the influence of a deterministic control policy \\\\( u(t) = Ce^{Dt}X(t) \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices integrated over a time interval.\n\nGiven the trajectory \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at some time t, can we infer the original state \\\\( X(0) \\\\) without having any information about a control policy \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even in the absence of a control policy, the presence of the stochastic term \\\\( BdW \\\\) introduces randomness that prevents exact back-calculation of \\\\( X(0) \\\\) from \\\\( X(t) \\\\). The stochastic nature implies multiple possible initial states could lead to the observed states at time t.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix A influences the change in X over time through the differential equation. The matrix B influences the stochastic component of the change in X. The matrix C and the matrix D together determine the control policy u(t), which in turn influences X(t) through its integration."
