  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a time-dependent input vector and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of introducing a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) over time t, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the integral result \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, can you infer whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied to the inputs \\\\( x(s) \\\\) originally, from t=0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the transformation \\\\( e^{Bs} \\\\) integrated over time may be difficult to distinguish due to combinations of A and B influencing the output in non-unique ways. The result \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from various modified inputs due to different B matrices or even from different input functions \\\\( x(s) \\\\), rendering the original application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) indeterminate from the final result alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
