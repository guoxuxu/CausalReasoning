  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the effects of differentiating this function and the application of an operation \\\\( T(z) = z' \\\\), where \\\\( z' \\\\) denotes the derivative of z.\n\nNow, suppose we introduce an intervention by transforming \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x) = z'(x+1) \\\\). Now, will the new function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) depend only on the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without any influence from the added transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention shifts the argument of the derivative from x to x+1, thereby creating a new function u that depends not only on the original setup of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) but also on the nature of the transformation (adding 1 to x). As a result, \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is inherently different from what would be obtained just by operating \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and reflects the influence of the intervention.",
