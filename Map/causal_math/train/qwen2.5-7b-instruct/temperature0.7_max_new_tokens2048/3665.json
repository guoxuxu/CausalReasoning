  "Problem": "We are studying a complex function \\\\( z = f(x+iy) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( f \\\\) is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = z + B \\\\) (with B as a constant complex matrix) affect the output of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to transform it to \\\\( f(z_0 + B) \\\\), and then this result evolves over time according to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), does \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) for any later time \\\\( t \\\\) remain the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been directly used in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the input to \\\\( f \\\\) by adding \\\\( B \\\\), leading to a different initial condition \\\\( f(z_0 + B) \\\\). As such, the evolution of the function will follow a different trajectory due to the change in the input, regardless of the properties of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0, when transformed by g(z) to z_0 + B, then passed through f, results in f(z_0 + B). This transformation and subsequent evolution over time via f(z) produces f(z(t)), which is equivalent to f(z_0 + B) if no further changes occur."
