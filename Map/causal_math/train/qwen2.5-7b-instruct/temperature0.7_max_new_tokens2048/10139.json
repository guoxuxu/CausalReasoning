  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit that involves a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) in series connected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The relationship between the current (I) and the voltage (V) across the circuit can be modeled using a differential equation \\\\( V - L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} - RI = 0 \\\\). We are also interested in the impact of a Laplace Transform on this differential equation.\n\nIf a new resistance R' is introduced significantly altering the circuit’s resistance at time t1 > 0, will the Laplace Transform of the post-intervention current I(t) for t > t1 be independent of the original resistance R?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a new resistance changes the equations governing the current's behavior in the circuit. The Laplace Transform of I(t) will therefore embed information about both the pre- and post-intervention resistances, reflecting changes in the damping and frequency of the oscillations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing a new resistance R' at time t1 will directly cause a change in the current I and consequently affect the Laplace transform of the current. The original resistance R will also directly cause changes in the current I, which in turn affects the Laplace transform of the current."
