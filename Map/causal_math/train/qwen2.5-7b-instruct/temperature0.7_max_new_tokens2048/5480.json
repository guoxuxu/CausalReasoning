  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of the system is analyzed when a transformation through a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) represented by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Lz \\\\) is introduced.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the precise transformations used (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both) be determined solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of the transformations \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), each interacting differently with the dynamics governed by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\). The same endpoint can emerge from multiple transformation histories, complicating the determination of which were actually applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(t) evolves to z(T) through the action of the linear operator L, meaning Lz → z(T) and z(t) → z(T)."
