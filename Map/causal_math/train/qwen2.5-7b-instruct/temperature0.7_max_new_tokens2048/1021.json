  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, where A is a constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which affects its subsequent evolution. The factor \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) changes the magnitude and possibly the phase of the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), leading to a trajectory that is scaled and/or rotated relative to the untreated evolution, thus leading to a different end state at time T.",
