  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic integral transform \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ax^2 + bx} f(t) dt \\\\), with constants \\\\( a, b \\\\) real and positive. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how the transform influences causal relationships by analyzing its effect on a specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how interventions might affect outcomes.\n\nCan one determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) solely from knowing the transformed function \\\\( G(x) \\\\) without additional parameters or properties of the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform can be affected significantly by the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), resulting in different possible forms of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) leading to the same \\\\( G(x) \\\\). Without the specific parameters, or knowledge about how the transform interacts with these parameters, it is impossible to definitively recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(x) \\\\).",
