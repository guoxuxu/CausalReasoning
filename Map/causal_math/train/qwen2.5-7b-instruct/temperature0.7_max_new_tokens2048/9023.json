  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a set of complex differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We study the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another complex matrix.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Kt}z \\\\) (where K is another complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M and not on S or K?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on M but also on S and K. The details of how these matrices relate and potentially non-commute would significantly influence the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
