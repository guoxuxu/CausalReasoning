  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a divergence-free condition. Study the effect of introducing a scalar field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) = T(x)e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), where T(x) represents a temperature distribution and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a growth rate, on heat transfer characteristics of the flow.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) \\\\) is introduced into the flow at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the Navier-Stokes equations governed by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature profile at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t = 0) \\\\) was evolved without the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) influences the advection and diffusion of the temperature field, altering the temperature profile over time compared to a scenario without flow, leading to differences in thermal dispersal and gradients.",
