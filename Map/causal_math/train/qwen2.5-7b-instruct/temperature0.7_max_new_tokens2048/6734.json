  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) through different linear transformations \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane, and we consider the effect of transformations on this motion.\n\nAfter observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) following an unknown transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), can we determine the exact initial state at t = 0 before any transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific parameters of \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\), backtracking to the exact initial state before the transformation is impossible. Parameter \\\\( A \\\\) and the added constant \\\\( b \\\\) create ambiguities in mapping the final state back to its precise original.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a linear transformation T(z) = Az + b to the complex function z(t) results in z(T), where A and b are complex numbers and ω is a real constant. The transformation A and b directly cause the change from z(t) to z(T)."
