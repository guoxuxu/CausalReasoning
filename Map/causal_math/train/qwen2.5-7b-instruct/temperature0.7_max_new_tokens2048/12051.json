  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) that represents a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which undergoes a transformation given by the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\). We examine how this transformation affects the causal relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform output, is it possible to determine whether the transformation \\( h(t) = t^2 \\) was applied before transforming \\( z(t) \\), by examining \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t) \\cdot h(t)) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "By analyzing \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t) \\cdot h(t)) \\) and its deviation from \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\), one can infer the application of \\( h(t) = t^2 \\). The alteration in the frequency-domain characteristics and the presence of terms indicative of \\( t^2 \\) multiplication allow us to determine the intervention accurately.",
