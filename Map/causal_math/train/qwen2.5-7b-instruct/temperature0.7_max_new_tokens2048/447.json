  "Problem": "Examine the influence of a nonlinear transformation \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant, on a discrete dynamical system \\\\( w_{n+1} = z(w_n) \\\\). Evaluate how these changes affect the behavior of sequences generated by this dynamic system over iterations.\n\nIf an intervention involves changing the constant \\\\( c \\\\) to a new constant \\\\( d \\\\) at some iteration \\\\( n \\\\), will the behavior of the sequence post-intervention depend only on the new constant \\\\( d \\\\) and not on the original constant \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constant from \\\\( c \\\\) to \\\\( d \\\\) mid-sequence alters the trajectory of the sequence, but the resulting behavior still depends on the state of the sequence at intervention and the historical influence of \\\\( c \\\\) up to that point, making the outcome a composite effect of both constants.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant c directly influences w_n+1 through z(w_n), and w_n directly causes w_n+1. Changing c to d at iteration n will affect the behavior of the sequence post-intervention, which will depend on both c and d, not just d alone."
