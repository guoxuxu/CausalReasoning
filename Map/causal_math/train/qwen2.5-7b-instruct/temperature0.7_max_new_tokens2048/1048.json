  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a space of functions, with the Fourier transform being used to transform these functions. An operator \\\\(M\\\\) modifies the function using transformation \\\\(Mf(x) = f(x-c)\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a constant. We examine how the spectrum of the functions is affected over the transformation by \\\\(M\\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) be perfectly reconstructed knowing only the final spectral output after successive applications of \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations and their effects on the spectral domain, especially when involving shifts and reflections, inherently lose certain original function characteristics. Even with the spectral data, ambiguities in phase and shifts prevent perfect reconstruction of the original function without further specific information on the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator M to a function f(x) results in a shift in its spectrum, which in turn affects whether the original function can be perfectly reconstructed from the final spectral output."
