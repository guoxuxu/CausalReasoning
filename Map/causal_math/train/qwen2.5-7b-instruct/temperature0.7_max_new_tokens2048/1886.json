  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and analyze its effects over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a later time T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied as the initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the Fourier transform was applied, the changes introduced by different frequency components due to thermal diffusion cannot be uniquely reversed to retrieve the original distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). The transformation alters specific frequency amplitudes and phases, complicating back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) directly causes the temperature distribution u(x,T) at a later time T. Applying a Fourier transform to u(x,0) changes u(x,0), which then directly causes the temperature distribution u(x,T) at a later time T."
