  "Problem": "Consider a system that is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a vector field representing velocity. We investigate how performing a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), affects the evolution of the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nKnowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), and using only this information, can we exactly determine what the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was, without knowledge of the Fourier transform applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation given by the Fourier transform and its inverse provides a one-to-one correspondence between the initial and evolved states under the conditions of the problem. Thus, given \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), one can compute back to determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Knowing the value of u(x, T) allows us to infer u(x, 0) through the inverse Fourier transform, and the Fourier transform of u(x, t) at any time t influences the form of u(x, t)."
