  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\(z = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator, representing the transformation matrix. We explore the effects of applying a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number.\n\nFrom the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we precisely identify the interventions applied (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), purely from the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\(z(T)\\\\) can result from different combinations of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) values, affecting the system output via their respective complex exponentials. The overlap in potential effects from different parameters makes it impossible to definitively determine the interventions from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear transformation L on x results in z, which then influences z(T). The functions f(z) and g(z) also independently affect z(T)."
