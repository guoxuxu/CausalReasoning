  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the implications of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf during the evaluation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) a new constant \\\\( R \\\\) is introduced changing the equation to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P+R)z + Q \\\\), will the subsequent values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original constants \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\), and not on the intervention by \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( R \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) significantly alters the differential equation, causing a change in the system's dynamics subsequently. This means the future values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will also depend on \\\\( R \\\\), not just \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of constant R changes the rate of change of z(t) starting from t1, thus affecting the values of z(t) for T > t1. Therefore, z(T) depends on both the original P and the introduced R."
