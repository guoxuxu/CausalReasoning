  "Problem": "Consider a linear function \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, used to transform complex vector input \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is determined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can one determine exactly which transformations were applied at different points (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), knowing just \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformation sequences could yield the same final state due to the complexity of matrix exponential interactions. The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from varying paths depending on when and which transformations were applied, rendering the precise historical inference of transformations infeasible without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "D determines z(t)'s evolution over time, C transforms z through h(z), and z(0) is the initial state of z. T leads to z(T) being the final state."
