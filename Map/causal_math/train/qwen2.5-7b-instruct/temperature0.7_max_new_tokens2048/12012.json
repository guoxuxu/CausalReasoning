  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a function f(z) in the complex plane, where \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) and k is a real constant. We explore the implications of modifying this function via a linear transformation \\( T(z) = az + b \\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane and then followed by the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting function at a point \\\\( z \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) first and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The order of applying these transformations matters due to the non-commutative nature of function composition in complex functions. Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) first and then \\\\( T(z) \\\\) results in \\\\( f(T(z)) = e^{k(az+b)} \\\\), which generally differs from \\\\( T(f(z)) = a e^{kz} + b \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
