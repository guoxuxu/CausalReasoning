  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the equation \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where x and y are real variables, and i is the imaginary unit. This system is subjected to the transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of the system is analyzed in a scenario where transformations are applied and the system evolves over time.\n\nObserving the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively trace back to the exact original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if the operation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) was known to have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( G(z) \\\\) affects the system dynamically and K being complex, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone doesn't provide enough information to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the exponential function is not necessarily injective, especially over complex numbers.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
