  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the evolution of a function is described as \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant and \\( z_0 \\) a complex initial value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\), with \\( B \\) also a complex constant.\n\nIf \\( T(z) \\) is applied to \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve under \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) for any T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved under \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( T(z) \\) fundamentally changes the expression for \\( z \\), as it introduces an accumulation effect integrated over time. This changes the trajectory from the get-go, meaning the state \\( z(T) \\) will not equivalently match the direct exponential growth under \\( e^{At} \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) depends on A, while T(z) transforms z over time based on B; applying T(z) does not result in the same z(T) as directly evolving z_0 under A without further transformation."
