  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iB\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) applied at time t, with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at t = T, without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces changes that depend on the integral of the state's history modified by \\\\( e^{-iB\\\\tau} \\\\). This integrated effect cannot be simply reversed or deduced from the state at t=T alone, making it difficult to trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector z_0 directly influences z(t) through the function z(t) = e^(iAt)z_0. The matrices A and B directly influence z(t). The variable t directly influences h(z) through the integral transformation h(z) = ∫_0^t e^(-iBτ)z(τ) dτ. z(t) indirectly influences h(z) through the integral transformation."
