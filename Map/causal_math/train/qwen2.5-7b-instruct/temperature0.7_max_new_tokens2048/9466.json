  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in terms of spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nGiven the observation of the Fourier Transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at t = T, can we deduce \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) the initial state in real space without knowing whether a Fourier Transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier Transform can be applied to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) to successfully deduce \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), and then the inverse of the evolution under \\\\(L\\\\) can be applied, assuming \\\\(L\\\\) is reversible, to find \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\). However, this relies heavily on the properties of \\\\(L\\\\) and assumes no loss of information during transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
