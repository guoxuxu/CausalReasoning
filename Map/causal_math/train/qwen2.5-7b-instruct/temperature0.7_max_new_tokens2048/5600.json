  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over the interval [0, T].\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were used throughout [0, T], merely by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used from just the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the overlapping effects of the transformations over different intervals, which can yield similar or indistinguishable end results. The complex plane dynamics under these transformations do not permit a clear separation of effects to trace back the exact sequence of transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
