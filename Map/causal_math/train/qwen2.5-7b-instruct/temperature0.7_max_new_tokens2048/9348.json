  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and its inverse operation.\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we uniquely identify whether an intervention \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at any time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), and if so, can we determine the exact form of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature of interventions like \\\\( h(x) \\\\) strictly from the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is generally infeasible without additional information. The diffusive nature of heat means many different combinations of interventions and initial conditions could lead to similar or the same distributions at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
