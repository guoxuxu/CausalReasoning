  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the system \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t)\\\\), with P being a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(z) = Qz \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be reliably deduced after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly back-calculate to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the transformation \\\\( Q \\\\) might have altered the initial state in a way that is indistinguishable solely from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) directly influences z(T) through the differential equation P → dz/dt, and the transformation Q → g(z) can alter the relationship between z(0) and z(T), making z(0) unreliably deducible from z(T) without knowledge of Q."
