  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined in a closed path in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are differentiable functions of t. The transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Tz = z^2 \\\\), applied to the path of z.\n\nAssuming an intervention \\\\( S \\\\) applied at t_1 where \\\\( S \\\\) is a translation operator on the complex plane, \\\\( Sz = z + c \\\\), does the end path at t = T solely depend on the original path and not on the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory by adding a constant complex number c. This addition changes the initial conditions post-t_1 which in conjunction with the initial transformation \\\\( T \\\\), alters the resulting path in a manner dependent on both operations' effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The end path of z at time T depends on the original path of z, which is influenced by the initial value of z and the translation operator S. The transformation operator T then maps z to Tz based on the current value of z."
