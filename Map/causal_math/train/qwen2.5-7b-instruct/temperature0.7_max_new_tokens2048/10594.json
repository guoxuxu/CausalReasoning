  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) over a rod of length L is described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) to the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\).\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) at time \\( t \\), can we determine the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Through the inverse Fourier transform and using properties of the heat equation, one can reconstruct the initial distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\), regardless of whether \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) was initially applied. The heat equation's linearity and time reversibility allow such deductions.",
