  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where vectors are transformed by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_a^b K(x, y) f(y) dy \\\\) operates on functions where \\\\( K(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function. We analyze the system's behavior when an initial function \\\\( f_0 \\\\) is either subjected directly to \\\\( T \\\\) or modified by a linear operation before application of \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( f_0 \\\\) undergoes a pre-transformation by a secondary matrix \\\\( N \\\\) before applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied afterward as an intervention, will the final system's output exclusively depend on \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) but not on \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the matrix \\\\( N \\\\) as a pre-transformation alters \\\\( f_0 \\\\) before it is processed by \\\\( T \\\\), which implies that the final output is affected by all three elements (\\\\( N \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\)). The output is a composite effect of all transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function f_0 first transforms to f_N via N, then T transforms f_N to T_f_N, and finally M transforms T_f_N to M_T_f_N. The final output M_T_f_N depends on N, T, and M."
