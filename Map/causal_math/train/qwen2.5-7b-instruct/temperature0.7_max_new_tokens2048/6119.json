  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected in series, described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = E(t) \\\\), where \\\\( q(t) \\\\) is the charge and \\\\( E(t) \\\\) is an external voltage source. The relationship to be studied involves examining the behavior of this RLC circuit under the transformation of an applied impulse response function denoted as \\\\( F(t) = e^{-st} \\\\).\n\nIf an additional impulse response \\\\( G(t) = e^{-ut} \\\\), where u is a constant, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the circuit's response at time T > t_1 still be predictable solely from knowing R, L, and C, without the need to consider s or u?",
  "Explanation": "The additional impulse at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further modifies the charge dynamics. The resulting state of the circuit at any time past \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (including \\\\( T \\\\)) will certainly be affected by both s and u values, as each impulse adds a new exponential decay contributing distinctively to how the total charge evolves over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
