  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. The impact of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is analyzed to understand its effects on the solution trajectory over variable \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nKnowing the solution \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we precisely determine the original initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(x) = e^{ax}\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(f(x)\\\\) modifies the initial condition in a way that fundamentally alters the output, and attempting to recover \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) without this knowledge leads to ambiguity in the presence of the spatial transformation, as multiple initial states can lead to similar evolved states citing the uniqueness property of solutions to linear PDEs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of u at time T influences the original initial condition u at time 0, and the parameter s affects the value of u at time T."
