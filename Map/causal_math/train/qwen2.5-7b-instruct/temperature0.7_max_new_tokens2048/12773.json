  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax + B} \\\\) with matrices A and B. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) to analyze its properties in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we reconstruct the exact matrices A and B without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation of \\\\( e^{Ax + B} \\\\) results in a frequency domain representation incorporating exponential and phase shift components related to both A and B. Due to the overlapping effects in the frequency domain, it is generally impractical to uniquely discern individual matrix components without extra constraints or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
