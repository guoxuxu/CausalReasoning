  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nIf the modulation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to x(t) to create a new signal \\\\( x'(t) = x(t)e^{at} \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) is transformed using Fourier, will \\\\( z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) results in a frequency shift in the Fourier domain. This shift is governed by the property \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)e^{at}\\\\} = z(\\\\omega - ia) \\\\), changing the frequencies present in the output compared to the unmodulated signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The modulation function h(t) and the constant a directly cause the new signal x'(t), which in turn directly causes the Fourier transform z'(ω). The original signal x(t) directly causes the original Fourier transform z(ω), and through x'(t), it also directly causes z'(ω)."
