  "Problem": "Consider a system ruled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) obeying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants. We will explore the system behavior under the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and the effect of a perturbation function \\\\( \\\\phi(t) = e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\) is applied to the system at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the system evolves under its natural dynamics \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be altered compared to without the use of \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\) modifies the initial condition and the path of the system even after being transformed by the Laplace transform. The introduction of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) alters how the differential equation's solution develops which directly reflects in the Laplace domain as an extra exponential factor that scales and shifts the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(t) directly influences its time derivative dz/dt, and through z(t), it also affects the transformed state Z(s). The perturbation φ(t) indirectly impacts z(t), which in turn alters dz/dt but does not change the fundamental relationship between z(t) and Z(s) under the given differential equation."
