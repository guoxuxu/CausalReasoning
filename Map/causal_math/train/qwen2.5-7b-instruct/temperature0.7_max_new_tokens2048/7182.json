  "Problem": "Assume we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The influence of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being another real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) denoting time, is considered.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) upon observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is crucial because it defines the scaling of the trajectory. Without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, two different initial conditions can lead to the same observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially considering the exponential and oscillatory nature introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z(t) is directly influenced by iω, and z(t) is determined by its initial condition z(0). Observing z(T) at time T allows us to infer z(t) up to a multiplicative factor if h(z) was applied, but we cannot uniquely determine the original initial condition z_0 without additional information."
