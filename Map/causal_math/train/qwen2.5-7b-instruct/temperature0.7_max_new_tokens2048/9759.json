  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention in the form of a different transformation \\( G(u) \\) is applied, will the end state \\( u(x, T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original heat equation and not on the Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) or the intervention \\( G(u) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\( G(u) \\) as an intervention adds another degree of manipulation to the system. The final state \\( u(x, T) \\) becomes dependent not only on the evolution of the heat equation but also on how the original \\( F(u) \\) and the intervention \\( G(u) \\) interact with the dynamics of the system, potentially altering the trajectory and the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of u(x, t) depends on u_t and Δu, while interventions like F(u) and G(u) can alter u(x, t) depending on their definitions. The end state u(x, T) for T > t_1 may be influenced by both the original heat equation and any transformations applied."
