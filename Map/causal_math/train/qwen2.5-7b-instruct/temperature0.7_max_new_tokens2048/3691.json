  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\xi t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applies a phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) leading to \\\\(z'(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)}\\\\) prior to the Fourier transform, will the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the transformed domain still be unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of a phase shift, while altering the time domain presentation of the signal, does not affect the frequency component under the Fourier transform. The frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) remains preserved, with the transform only modifying the complex phase in the frequency domain, not the location or the presence of the frequency component.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The phase shift ϕ in z'(t) does not affect the frequency ω in the Fourier transform domain, as the Fourier transform of z'(t) = e^(i(ωt + ϕ)) results in a frequency component of ω."
