  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is considered.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st^2} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the result of \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) at t = T completely ignore the intervention by U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U \\\\) modifies the system, altering the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and consequently the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) at any time later than \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect this change, integrating a different function affected by U.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation U applied to z(t) at time t_1 influences the result of T applied to z(t) because z'(t) directly causes changes in z(t), and thus any alteration to z(t) will affect its Laplace transform T[z](s)."
