  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively. Here, A and B are real constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is considered in the analysis.\n\nKnowing \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at T, can we uniquely recover the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it evolved from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) aggregates the values over time, losing individual time point information about \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The inversion to recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is not uniquely determinable without additional constraints or information about the behavior of A and B.",
