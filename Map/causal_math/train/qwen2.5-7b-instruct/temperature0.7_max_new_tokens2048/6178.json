  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) governing the displacement \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of a string, where \\\\(c\\\\) is the wave speed. To analyze this system, we consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\), transforming the equation into a simpler form.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t\\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and \\\\(g(x)\\\\) in the spatial domain without prior knowledge of whether a Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the Fourier transform was indeed applied, the transformed equation provides sufficient information to reconstruct the initial conditions uniquely. By inverse transforming \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) and its time derivative, one can accurately determine \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and \\\\(g(x)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
