  "Problem": "Consider the response space of a signal processing system, modeled by the integral transform \\( Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\), known as the Laplace transform. We explore the effect of modifying the input signal \\( x(t) \\) by a function \\( f(x) = e^{At}x(t) \\), where A is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(x) = R(t)x(t) \\) (where \\( R(t) \\) is another modulation function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( Y(s) \\) for s > 0 depend only on \\( Y(s) \\) and not on A or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(x) \\) introduces another modifying factor to the input \\( x(t) \\), making the final Laplace transform \\( Y(s) \\) depend on \\( A \\), due to the initial \\( f(x) \\), and \\( R \\), due to \\( g(x) \\). The transformations interact and affect the system's response, showing dependencies beyond just the original transform equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) directly influences Y(s) through the Laplace transform. Modifying x(t) with f(x) or applying g(x) also directly influences Y(s). The parameters A and R modulate x(t) but their effects are incorporated within the transformed Y(s) without being explicitly visible as separate variables."
