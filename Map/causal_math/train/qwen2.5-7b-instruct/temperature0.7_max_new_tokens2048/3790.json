  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a complex constant, and its application in an integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We investigate how changes in the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) influence the transformation output.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( F(s) \\\\) for a particular value of \\\\( s \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function parameter \\\\( c \\\\) without knowing the initial value of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\) initially used in the transformation, multiple values of \\\\( c \\\\) might correspond to similar shapes or magnitudes in the resulting function \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The integral's sensitivity to the phase and growth rate induced by \\\\( c \\\\) needs precise knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\) for accurate back-calculation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
