  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effect of multiplying \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by an exponential function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, on the transformed function, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at}h(t)) \\\\).\n\nIf we first transform \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\), then apply a secondary exponential shift \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) as an intervention before transforming it again, will the final result depend solely on the initial function or also include shifts by both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The secondary transformation with \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) introduces an additional shift, resulting in a final transform of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at}e^{bt}h(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s - a - b) \\\\), which depends on both shifts \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) applied to the system.",
