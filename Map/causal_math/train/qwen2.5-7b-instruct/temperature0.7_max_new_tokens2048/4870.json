  "Problem": "Let's consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the system's response under the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) for a constant k.\n\nGiven the position \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\) accurately without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(x)\\\\), it's impossible to definitively determine \\\\(x_0\\\\) from \\\\(x(T)\\\\), since the position could have been influenced by the exponential factor \\\\(e^{kt}\\\\) modifying the amplitude. This uncertainty about the initial scaling results in ambiguity regarding the original state of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
