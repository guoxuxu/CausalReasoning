  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) on the system and manipulating the transformed function.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine the specific intervention \\\\( g(k) \\\\) applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different interventions \\\\( g(k) \\\\) could result in the same or similar final states \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), especially given the interactions and superpositions of wave components. Without additional information about the spectrum of \\\\( u \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) or between \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), it's impossible to unequivocally determine the specific intervention made.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Knowing the final state u(x, T) allows us to infer the specific intervention g(k) applied at time t1 in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform converts the spatial representation u(x, t) into the frequency domain, where interventions are represented as g(k)."
