  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (A u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a state variable and \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant vector field. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), which changes \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) to its frequency domain representation.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what interventions (like Fourier transform or convolution) were applied throughout the evolution, only by knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) might result from various possible sequences and types of interventions, and similar end states can be achieved through different transformations due to the properties of linear operations and possible equivalences or overlaps in the effects of different transforms and convolutions on the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, t) evolves over time due to the advection by the vector field A, and this evolution can be transformed using the Fourier transform F(u) to obtain the frequency domain representation hat{u}(k, t). Knowing the final state u(x, T) does not uniquely determine the sequence of interventions applied during the evolution, such as the Fourier transform or other operations."
