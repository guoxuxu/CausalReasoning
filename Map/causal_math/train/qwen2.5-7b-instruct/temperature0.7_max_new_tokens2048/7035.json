  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the equation \\\\(z'(t) = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit, and \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix. We are examining the role of the operator \\\\(T(z) = e^{Bt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, in transforming the state of the system over time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new function \\\\(U(z) = e^{Ct}z(t)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\) is inserted, does the final state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend exclusively on the original matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and not on \\\\(B\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(U(z)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) alters the trajectory, which now depends on the nature and interplay between \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(A\\\\). The total evolution reflects the compounded effects of these transformations, each contributing to the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)) is directly influenced by the operator A. The state of z at any time is transformed by the operator T and further modified by the intervention U."
