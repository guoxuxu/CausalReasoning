  "Problem": "Consider the complex plane where functions are mapped using a transformation \\\\( z' = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) indicates time. Analyze the impact of this transformation under the integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), reflecting a periodic adjustment over time T.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time T, can we pinpoint whether an intervention altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) occurred, based purely on the known result?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the presence of an intervention, like a change in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), solely based on the result of the integral transformation is not feasible, as different combinations of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), T, and interventions could potentially result in the same outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The information about the transformations is lost in the integration over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Time T influences the outcome g(z) through the integration of z(t) adjusted by e^{-iωt}. The constant ω influences z' and e^{iωt}, which in turn affects g(z) via the integral transformation."
