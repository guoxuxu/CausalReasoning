  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the behavior of the system under the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is another matrix.\n\nObserving the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after it evolves until time T, can we infer if the transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{At}x \\\\) was initially applied, assuming no additional data about the structure of A or D?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific matrices A and D, and how they influence each other, it is difficult to backtrack and confirm if \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied. Given many combinations and interactions could lead to the same observable state at time T, it is not possible to definitively state the initial application of transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(x) = e^(At)x changes the state x over time T, and the matrix A directly influences this transformation while the matrix D directly affects the evolution of x according to the differential equation."
