  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation governed by \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative, \\\\( u_{xx} \\\\) is the spatial second derivative, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the state of \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can the types of transformations (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) applied previously be uniquely identified from \\\\( u(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of the exponential terms introduced by \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\) during their respective durations might overlap or mask one another in effect by the time t = T. As both transformations exponentially decay, their individual effects become less distinguishable, leading to multiple plausible histories that could result in the observed state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time derivative u_t directly causes changes in u, time t directly causes changes in u, the constant λ directly causes the form of the transformation f(u), and time T directly causes the state u(T)."
