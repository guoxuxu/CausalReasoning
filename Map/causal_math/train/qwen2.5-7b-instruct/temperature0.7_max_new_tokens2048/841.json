  "Problem": "Consider a continuous time system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(s)y(s) ds \\\\), with \\\\( K(s) \\\\) and \\\\( y(s) \\\\) representing kernel and input functions, respectively. We investigate the effect of an input transformation \\\\( y'(s) = y(s) + h(s) \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is another function, on the output over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( y'(s) = y(s) + h(s) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the system evolves under the original equation without any further intervention, will the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t be the same as if only \\\\( y(s) \\\\) was applied directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by adding \\\\( h(s) \\\\) to \\\\( y(s) \\\\) changes the input function from the initial point, thereby altering the integral computation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This change in input modifies the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly because the integral now includes the contribution from \\\\( h(s) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the input transformation y'(s) = y(s) + h(s) at t=0 will change the output z(t) over time because h(s) affects y'(s), which in turn influences z(t) through the kernel K(s). The output z(t) will differ from the scenario where only y(s) is applied directly."
