  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) applied to elements in the complex plane. We analyze the effects of performing a linear transformation on z via a matrix M before and after applying the function.\n\nIf an additional linear transformation \\\\(N\\\\) is applied as an intervention after applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and matrix \\\\(M\\\\), will the final result be independent of the sequence of \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final outcome will depend on the order of matrix applications. If \\\\(M\\\\) is applied before \\\\(N\\\\), it might yield a different result compared to applying \\\\(N\\\\) before \\\\(M\\\\) due to matrix multiplication properties (non-commutativity).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying matrix M to z before f(z) = e^z transforms z, then f(z) exponentiates the transformed z; applying N after f(z) further transforms the output of f(z). The sequence of transformations matters as N acts on the result of f(z), not directly on M's transformation."
