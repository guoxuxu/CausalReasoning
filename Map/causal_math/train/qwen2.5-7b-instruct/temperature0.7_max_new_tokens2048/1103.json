  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are matrices. This system is affected by applying an integration transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int z(t) dt \\\\). We assess how the system behaves with or without this transformation, and how interventions could influence results over time.\n\nIf during the system evolution at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention using another operation \\\\( j(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ks}z(s)ds \\\\) (where K is a constant matrix) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( C \\\\) and not on \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( K \\\\), or the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity by integrating z along a modified exponential path influenced by K. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus depends on the interplay of \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( K \\\\), as well as how the initial conditions were set or transformed, leading to potential variations in the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on C through the system dynamics z(t) = Cz + D, and is also influenced by the intervention j(z) = ∫_0^t e^(Ks)z(s)ds, which introduces the effect of K. The initial transformation h(z) does not directly affect the final state z(T) but may influence the intermediate state z(t)."
