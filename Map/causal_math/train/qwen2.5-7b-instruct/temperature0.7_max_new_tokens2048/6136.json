  "Problem": "Investigate a vector field governed by a linear transformation and its potential modification by another function defined as \\( h(x) = \\int e^{Mt} dt \\cdot x \\), where M is a constant matrix. The original vector function is defined by \\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\), for a constant matrix L.\n\nCan we determine precisely which interventions (whether \\( h(x) \\), \\( k(x) \\), or both) were utilized, solely based on the final state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( x(T) \\), multiple histories involving \\( h(x) \\) and/or \\( k(x) \\) could lead to the same final state due to the operations of \\( e^{Mt} \\) and \\( d^{Nt} \\) potentially overlapping in their state influence. Without additional temporal or transformative context, the exact intervention sequence cannot be determined uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation defined by h(x) and the original dynamics defined by Lx both influence the final state x(T)."
