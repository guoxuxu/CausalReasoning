  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\( x' = Dx \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Study the effect of the transformation \\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\) over time t, where L is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a function \\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\) (where M is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on L or M?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention with \\( h(x) \\) changes the trajectory in a way that depends not only on D but also significantly on L and M. The matrix \\( e^{Mt} \\) introduces new dynamics, interplaying with the previous transformations \\( e^{Lt} \\) and the diagonalization by S.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x depends on D through x' = Dx, and is transformed over time t by g(x) involving L, but an intervention h(x) involving M does not change the dependency on D for the endpoint x(T) when T > t_1."
