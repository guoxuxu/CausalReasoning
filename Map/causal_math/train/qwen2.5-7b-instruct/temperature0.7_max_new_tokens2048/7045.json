  "Problem": "We consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Mz \\\\), with M being a complex matrix. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, would \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T reflect the same results as direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the system for t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions with the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\), which alters the trajectory of the system. The nonlinear interaction between N and M affects the evolution, leading to a different complex vector at any subsequent time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex vector z(0) evolves over time T under the system Mz → ∂z/∂t to become z(T). Applying the transformation f(z) = e^(Nt)z at t=0 does not alter the outcome of the direct evolution z(0) → z(T) under the system for t=T."
