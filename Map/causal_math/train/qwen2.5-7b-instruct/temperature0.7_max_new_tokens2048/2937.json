  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + p(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a position-dependent velocity field. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a specific time.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t = t_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + p(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at any later time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t \\\\) under the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) and evolving the transformed function versus directly evolving \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) under the PDE leads to different outcomes. The evolution of the Fourier coefficients depends on the velocity field \\\\( p(x) \\\\), which may affect the modal interaction differently than simple translation in the x-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, t_0) → u(x, t); Fourier(u(x, t_0)) → Fourier(u(x, t)); p(x) → ∂u/∂x; ∂u/∂t → Fourier(∂u/∂t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of \\( u(x, t_0) \\) under the PDE to \\( u(x, t) \\) results in the same Fourier transform as evolving the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, t_0) \\) to \\( t \\) under the transformed PDE. Position-dependent velocity field \\( p(x) \\) influences the spatial derivative of \\( u \\), and this influences the temporal derivative which in turn affects the Fourier transform."
