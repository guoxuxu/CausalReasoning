  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The function is subjected to the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-s^2} f(s) ds \\\\). Analyze the implications of applying this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( g(f) \\\\) after applying both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and another unknown function \\\\( k(z) \\\\) as interventions, can we precisely determine the forms of both interventions from the resultant output?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexity added by integrating the transformations and the infinite domain of integration, deciphering the exact forms of interventions \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) solely from the resultant output of \\\\( g \\\\) is impractical. Multiple functions could yield the same result under this transformation, creating ambiguity in identifying exact interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
