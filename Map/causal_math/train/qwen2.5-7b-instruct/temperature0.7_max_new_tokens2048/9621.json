  "Problem": "Let's explore a scenario involving a Laplace transform used to solve an initial value problem described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0 \\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the behavior of the solution subject to modifications by the transform \\( T(y) = y e^{kt} \\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf \\( T(y) \\) is applied to the initial solution \\( y_0 \\) of the differential equation at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the resulting \\( y(t) \\) at time T still solve the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T(y) \\) modifies the initial condition by multiplying by \\( e^{kt} \\). This transformation alters the compliance of \\( y(t) \\) with the original differential equation since the behavior of the derivative operations over \\( e^{kt} \\) introduces additional terms not canceled out by the original equation, changing the system's trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(y) = y e^{kt} to the initial solution y_0 at t=0 results in a new function y(t) that, if k is chosen appropriately, can still solve the original differential equation with constants p and q."
