  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We examine the influence of an external heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) modeled by the transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + q(x,t) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), which includes the heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\), was applied, it's impossible to reliably trace the original distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). The source could have significantly altered the heat profile, especially if its distribution is non-trivial.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
