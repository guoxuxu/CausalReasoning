  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit that can be modeled as a linear system governed by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix representing the circuit parameters, x is the voltage across various components, and b is the input current source vector. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_a^b x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied to observe accumulated voltage responses over time.\n\nIf an additional linear transformation \\\\( U(x) = Cx \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at some time t = c, will the outcome of \\\\( T(x) \\\\) from a to b depend solely on the initial configuration of A and not on C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(x) \\\\) changes the state of the system via the transformation \\\\( Cx \\\\), which influences the overall trajectory of x and, consequently, the values accumulated by \\\\( T(x) \\\\). As such, the outcome depends on both the initial system configuration (A) and the intervention matrix C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
