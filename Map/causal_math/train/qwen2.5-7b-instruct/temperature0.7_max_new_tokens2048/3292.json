  "Problem": "Analyze the interplay of linear transformations and differential operators in a vector space. Assume we have a set of equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. Then, explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\), where R is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine with certainty which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both) based solely on knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from various sequences or combinations of transformations like \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\) and \\\\(h(z) = Sz\\\\) due to the potential overlap in effects from each transformation. This ambiguity prevents a precise reverse engineering of the interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
