  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the wave equation in a one-dimensional domain, defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to the initial conditions.\n\nGiven only the Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we exactly reconstruct the original initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\), the specific way in which each frequency component evolves back to the original time cannot be determined accurately. Knowledge of \\\\( c \\\\) is essential to correctly backtrack each frequency component's evolution, which affects the ability to reconstruct the initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The displacement u(x,t) at any time t influences its value at initial time u(x,0). The Fourier transform of the state u(x,t) at time T is causally linked to the Fourier transform of the initial condition u(x,0). The wave speed c affects the Fourier transform of the state u(x,t)."
