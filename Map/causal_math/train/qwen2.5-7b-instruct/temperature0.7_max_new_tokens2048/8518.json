  "Problem": "Consider a damped harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping and angular frequency parameters, respectively. Let's analyze the effect of a transformation on the initial conditions by applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x_0e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the observation of the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we conclusively determine the original initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The transformation could have altered the amplitude or phase, making it unclear whether the changes in the system's characteristics at time T are due to natural dynamics or the initial modification.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
