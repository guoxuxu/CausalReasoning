  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iB\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) applied at time t, with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the evolving state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, will the state after applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at T+Δt be the same as if no transformation was applied at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the state by integrating a transformed version of the state over time, changing the future state due to accumulation of past states modified by \\\\( e^{-iB\\\\tau} \\\\). This affects the subsequent evolution differently than just the natural progression under \\\\( e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences the state z(t) through the evolution matrix A and time t. The state z(t) directly influences the integral transformation h(z) through time t and the transformation matrix B. Applying h(z) at time t=T changes z(T+Δt), which would be different if no transformation was applied at t=T."
