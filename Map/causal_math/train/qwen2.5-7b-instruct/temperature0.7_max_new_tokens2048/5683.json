  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + xu_x = 0 \\), where \\( u(t, x) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) and space \\( x \\). Investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\xi x}u(t, x)dx \\) on the system over time.\n\nIf a transformation \\( \\hat{v}(t, \\xi) = e^{i\\xi^2t}\\hat{u}(t, \\xi) \\) is applied at some point \\( t_1 \\), will the behavior of \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) accurately reflect the initial characteristics dictated by \\( u(0, x) \\) solely under its inherent dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( e^{i\\xi^2t} \\) alters the propagation characteristics significantly by introducing new dynamics in \\( \\xi \\)-space, making the final state a product of both the inherent dynamics and the intervention.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(0, x) directly influences u(t, x) through the partial differential equation. The Fourier transform of u(t, x) leads to Fourier(u)(t, ξ), which is then transformed to Fourier(v)(t, ξ) using the transformation e^(iξ^2t). This transformation affects the behavior of v(t, x) but does not reflect the initial characteristics of u(0, x) for T > t1 unless the transformation is reversed."
