  "Problem": "Investigate the interaction of a discrete dynamic system characterized by the linear mapping equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), in which M is a constant matrix. Consider the transformation induced by the function \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix that acts at a specific moment.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at \\( n = 0 \\) and then allowing the system to evolve under \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\) without further intervention result in the same state at \\( n = N \\) as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\( n = N \\) under \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) alters the initial conditions. As the states evolve linearly by M, having changed the initial state to \\\\( D x_0 \\\\) introduces a change at each step proportional to powers of M and D, leading to a different state at step N unless M and D commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "g(x_0) → x_1; x_0 → x_1; Mx_1 → x_2; M(g(x_0)) → x_2",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(x) to x_0 results in x_1, which is equivalent to directly using x_0 to find x_1. Subsequently, evolving both x_1 through M to x_2 yields the same state regardless of whether g(x) was applied initially."
