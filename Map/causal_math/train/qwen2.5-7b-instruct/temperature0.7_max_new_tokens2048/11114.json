  "Problem": "Let's examine a thermal system where temperature \\( T \\) at any point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\), with \\( k \\) as the thermal diffusivity constant. We study the impact of a sudden temperature change applied using a function \\( f(T) = T + h \\), where \\( h \\) is a constant heat increment.\n\nUpon observing \\( T(x,T) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we determine whether the function \\( f(T) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) without other data?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional data about the initial state \\( T_0(x) \\) or the constant \\( h \\), it isn't possible to definitively infer if \\( T(x,t) \\) resulted from evolution of \\( T_0(x) + h \\) or \\( T_0(x) \\) alone, since diffusion could equally distribute the initial heat increment over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function f(T) increases the temperature T, which then influences the temperature distribution T(x,t) over space and time t."
