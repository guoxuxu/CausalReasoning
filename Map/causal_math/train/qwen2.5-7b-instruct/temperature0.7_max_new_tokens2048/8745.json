  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We are exploring the impact of performing a Fourier transform on this function over time and analyzing the behavior with subsequent Laplace transforms.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is originally applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and allowed to evolve without further modifications, will the resulting frequency-domain representation change over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a stationary function like \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a delta function located at the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Since the frequency content of the function does not change over time, neither will its Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
