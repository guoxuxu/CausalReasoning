  "Problem": "Imagine a scenario in which a heat distribution in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant, and subscripts denote partial derivatives. We explore the implications of an initial condition changed by a function \\\\( f(x) = u(x, 0) e^{\\lambda x} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is modified by applying \\\\( f(x) \\\\), and the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, does \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), for some future time T, remain solely determined by \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the initial condition with \\\\( f(x) \\\\) alters the initial temperature profile, hence the subsequent temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will not only depend on the heat equation but also on the nature of the modification induced by \\\\( f(x) \\\\), specifically the value of \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition modified by f(x) determines the initial temperature distribution u(x, 0), which then evolves over time according to the heat equation u_t = k u_{xx} to determine u(x, t) at any future time t."
