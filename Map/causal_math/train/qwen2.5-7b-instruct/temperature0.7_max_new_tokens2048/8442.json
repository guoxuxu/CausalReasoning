  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) describes a rotation with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We explore the response of the system when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to a transformation using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nObserving the position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the complex plane, can we uniquely determine whether the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was initially applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Just knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not provide enough information to retroactively conclude whether \\\\( L \\\\) was applied, because the same position at \\\\( T \\\\) could result from different initial points predicated upon different values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in the transformation.",
