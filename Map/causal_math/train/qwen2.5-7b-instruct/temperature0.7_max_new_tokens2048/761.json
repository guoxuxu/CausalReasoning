  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The function's evolution is governed by the linear differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Pz \\), where \\( P \\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Qt}z(\\tau) d\\tau \\), where \\( Q \\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\( I(z) \\) is applied to \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = Pz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = Pz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( I(z) \\) changes the initial conditions by integrating the effect of \\( e^{Qt}z(\\tau) \\) over time. This transformation alters the evolutionary path of \\( z(t) \\), producing a different outcome at time T due to the specific effects of matrix \\( Q \\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the initial condition z_0 at t=0 and evolving it under the differential equation with matrix P leads to the same z(t) at time T as applying the integral transformation I(z) with matrix Q to z_0 and then evolving the result under the same differential equation P."
