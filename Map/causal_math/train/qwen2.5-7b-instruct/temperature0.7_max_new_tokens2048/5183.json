  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{wt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Study the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, and T is the upper limit of integration.\n\nIf an intervention adjusts \\\\( w \\\\) to a new value mid-interval, (e.g., at T/2 where \\\\( w \\\\) becomes \\\\( w' \\\\)), will the result of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at T capture only the initial or the final value of \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) will reflect both the first half and the second half of the interval, incorporating the effects of both \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( w' \\\\). The output is a composite of both dynamics, and the result depends on the contributions from \\\\( w \\\\) up to T/2 and from \\\\( w' \\\\) from T/2 to T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w initially influences z(t) until T/2, after which the value of w' influences z(t). The value of s determines G(z), and T sets the upper limit for the integral defining G(z)."
