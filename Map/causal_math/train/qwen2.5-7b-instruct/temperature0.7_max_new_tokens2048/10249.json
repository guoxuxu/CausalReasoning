  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The impact of a transformation, defined by \\\\( g(z) = R(t)z \\\\) where \\\\( R(t) = e^{iNt} \\\\) (N being a constant complex matrix) on the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and is then evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) until time T without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by applying the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{iNt} \\\\) which influences the trajectory based on how the matrices N and M interact, leading to different states at time T unless N and M commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) = R(t)z changes the initial state z(0) to z(t) which is then evolved under the differential equation Mz to become z(T). This process is equivalent to directly evolving z(0) under Mz from t=0 to t=T without the transformation."
