  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. Over time, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( T \\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the output at some time \\\\( T \\\\) subsequent to both the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and the linear operation \\\\( U \\\\), is it possible to ascertain exactly which interventions (\\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or both) were applied based solely on the condition of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific applications of interventions such as \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) based on the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the integration and additional linear transformation complicating the complexity and interaction of the terms. The final state could result from various combinations and sequences of these operations, making it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
