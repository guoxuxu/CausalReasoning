  "Problem": "Imagine a scenario in which a heat distribution in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant, and subscripts denote partial derivatives. We explore the implications of an initial condition changed by a function \\\\( f(x) = u(x, 0) e^{\\lambda x} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at a fixed time T, can we deduce the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied initially, it is impossible to accurately recover the exact initial conditions \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) potentially altered the initial temperature in a way that is not discernable from the final distribution alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition f(x) influences the temperature distribution u(x, 0), which in turn determines the temperature distribution u(x, T) at a later time."
