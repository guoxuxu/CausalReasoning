  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions. The transformation involves the application of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier transform output \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) measured after an unknown intervention, can we determine precisely what the intervention was?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform provides the frequency content of the signal but does not inherently encode specific information about the nature of time-domain interventions uniquely. Multiple different alterations could result in the same frequency spectrum, leading to ambiguity in identifying the exact intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex-valued signal z(t) is transformed into its frequency domain representation F(z)(ω) via the Fourier transform. An intervention influences z(t), which in turn affects F(z)(ω)."
