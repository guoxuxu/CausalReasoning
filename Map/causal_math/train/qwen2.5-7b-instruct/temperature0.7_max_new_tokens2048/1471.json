  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a series of transformations including a Fourier Transform followed by a linear filter represented by a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then an inverse Fourier Transform.\n\nIf an additional non-linear distortion \\\\( D(t) \\\\) is applied to the signal after the inverse Fourier Transform, will the final output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) still be fully characterized by the linear filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the non-linear distortion \\\\( D(t) \\\\) significantly alters the final output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), meaning it cannot be characterized solely by the linear properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The non-linearity introduced by \\\\( D(t) \\\\) adds additional effects that are not represented by the linear transformation alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) is transformed by the Fourier Transform to X(s), which is then filtered by H(s) to produce Y(s), inverse transformed back to y(t), and finally distorted by D(t) to create the final output z(t). The linear filter H(s) affects the intermediate signal Y(s) before the addition of non-linear distortion D(t)."
