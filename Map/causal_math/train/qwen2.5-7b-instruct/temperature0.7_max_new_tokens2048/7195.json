  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform, represented by the function \\\\( F(u) \\\\), to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and how this affects the behavior over time.\n\nIf an additional operation, \\\\( G(u) = e^{Ht}u \\\\) (where \\\\( H \\\\) is another linear operator), is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the effects of \\\\( F(u) \\\\) or \\\\( G(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) introduces another variable into the system, modifying the trajectory and the final state. Consequently, the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will depend not only on \\\\( L \\\\) but also on the transformations introduced by \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and \\\\( G(u) \\\\), as these can introduce additional dynamics and interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of u over time is influenced by L through the partial differential equation, while G and F both directly affect u. However, the endpoint u(x, T) for T > t_1 depends on L and the combined effect of G and F up to time t_1."
