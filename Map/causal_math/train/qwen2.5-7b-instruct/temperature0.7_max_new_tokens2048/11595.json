  "Problem": "Analyze the interaction between a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\) and a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(v) \\\\) applied to vector \\\\( v \\\\) in Euclidean space. Matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is constant, and the Fourier transform operates on function space representations of \\\\( v \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applying a filter \\\\( h(v) \\\\) in the Fourier domain is introduced after the linear transformation and prior to the Fourier transform, will the resulting vector's transformation be only dependent on matrix \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a filtering process in the Fourier domain fundamentally alters the resultant vector post-Fourier transform. The output now depends on the specific characteristics of \\\\( h(v) \\\\), along with the effects of \\\\( M \\\\). This dependency introduces additional dynamics beyond just the influence of \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A linear transformation T(v) = Mv produces a transformed vector T(v), which is then filtered in the Fourier domain by h(v) to produce F'(v). The Fourier transform F(v) of the original vector v is first modified by the linear transformation before being further processed by the filter h(v). The resulting vector's transformation depends on both matrix M and the filter h(v)."
