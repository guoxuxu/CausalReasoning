  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. This function represents an oscillatory behavior in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, on the function's behavior.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to a new function \\\\( T'(z) = z^m \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is a positive integer different from \\\\( n \\\\), will the resulting function at time t = T solely depend on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( m \\\\) or \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( T'(z) \\\\) changes the transformation again to raise the function to a new power of \\\\( m \\\\), the resulting frequency of oscillation will be \\\\( m \\omega \\\\). Thus the behavior at time T directly depends on the value of both \\\\( m \\\\) and the originally transformed \\\\( n \\omega \\\\), as observed from the multiple transformations affecting the original oscillation frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T' directly causes the resulting function T. The angular frequency ω determines the oscillatory behavior of z(t), and z(t) determines the original transformation T. The resulting function T at time t does not depend on m or n, only on ω."
