  "Problem": "Assume a function defined on complex numbers \\\\(z\\\\) as \\\\(f(z) = e^{az}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. This function undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\) for \\\\(\\\\operatorname{Re}(s) > \\\\operatorname{Re}(a)\\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation on various scenarios.\n\nIf a modification is applied to the Laplace transform, changing it to \\\\(G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2}\\\\), and then inverted back to the time domain, does the resulting function depend only on \\\\(a\\\\) without influences from the original form of \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification to the transform changes the nature of the function from simple exponential to a multiplied-by-time exponential. The resulting function is influenced by both the original parameter \\\\(a\\\\) and the nature of the transformation applied, indicating dependency beyond the original \\\\(a\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) transforms to F(s) via the Laplace transform, F(s) changes to G(s) with a modification, and G(s) inversely transforms to f'(z) in the time domain."
