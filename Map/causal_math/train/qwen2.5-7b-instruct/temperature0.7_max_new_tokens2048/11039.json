  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowing the system to evolve.\n\nIf an intervention is applied where a new function \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(\\\\xi, t_1) = \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t_1) e^{-Ct} \\\\) (where C is a constant) is used at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to modify the state, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting the trajectory of the evolution. The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will be influenced by both the original differential operator L and the new modification factor introduced by the exponential term \\\\( e^{-Ct} \\\\), indicating dependency on factors beyond just L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, t); L → u(x, t); u(x, t_1) → u(x, T); C → u(x, T); t_1 → u(x, T); T → u(x, T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) evolves over time according to the operator L to become u(x, t). At time t_1, modifying u(x, t_1) with the factor e^{-Ct} changes it to \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t_1), which then continues to evolve under L to become u(x, T) at time T. The constant C influences this evolution, and T determines the final state."
