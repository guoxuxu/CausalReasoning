  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) maps complex numbers to other complex numbers, defined by \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) for a real matrix A. The evolution of the function is then impacted by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) known from integral transforms, specifically \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point another matrix transformation \\\\( B \\\\) is applied such that the function becomes \\\\( z(x) = e^{iBx}z(x) \\\\), will the result of the operator \\\\( L \\\\) depend solely on the original matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of matrix B modifies the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) prior to the action of \\\\( L \\\\). This means that the result of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( z(x) \\\\) will now be influenced by both the original matrix A and the newly applied matrix B. The properties of matrix exponentials and their combinations will significantly affect the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
