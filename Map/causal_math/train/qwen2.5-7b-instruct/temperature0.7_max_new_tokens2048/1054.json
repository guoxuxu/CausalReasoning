  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) represents the Fourier space variable, on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0 without any information about intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "If the system and its transformations are all linear, and the Fourier transformation is invertible (under suitable conditions such as absence of zero frequencies if assuming spatial decay of \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\)), then \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform and using the known evolution under \\\\(L\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, t) → Lu; u(x, t) → ∂u/∂t; u(x, t) → hat{u}(k, t); hat{u}(k, t) → hat{u}(k, T); hat{u}(k, T) → u(x, 0)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original state u(x, t) evolves under the linear differential operator L to produce its time derivative ∂u/∂t; applying the Fourier transformation to u(x, t) yields hat{u}(k, t); the state of the transformed function at time T, hat{u}(k, T), can be used to reconstruct the initial condition u(x, 0) if no other transformations intervene."
