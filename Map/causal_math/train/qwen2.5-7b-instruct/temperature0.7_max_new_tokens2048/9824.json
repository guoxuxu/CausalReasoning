  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a transformation via a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) on a complex plane where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. Consider the system's change over time if it is described by the flow \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we uniquely ascertain what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(w) \\\\), \\\\( h(w) \\\\), or both) based solely on the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific transformations from the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is ambiguous due to the potential for different combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) to yield the same result, especially given the nature of complex exponentials and their effects on the phase and magnitude of \\\\( w \\\\). This overlap in effects means that multiple operational sequences can lead to the same endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state w, through the transformation g(w) with angle θ and the flow described by k, influences the final state w(T). Both g(w) and h(w) could potentially describe the transformation leading to w(T), making it impossible to uniquely ascertain which specific transformations were applied based solely on w(T)."
