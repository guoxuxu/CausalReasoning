  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant thermal diffusivity. An external heat source modifies this equation by a term \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\), making it \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + v(x,t) \\\\).\n\nBy observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer if the external source \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) was present without prior knowledge of its application?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the presence or absence of \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\), it is indeterminate to reverse-engineer the exact initial conditions and system dynamics solely from the final temperature distribution, as multiple combinations of initial conditions and source terms could result in the same \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The external heat source v(x,t) influences the temperature distribution u(x,t), and observing u(x,T) at time T provides information about the presence of v(x,t) but does not directly infer v(x,t) without additional data."
