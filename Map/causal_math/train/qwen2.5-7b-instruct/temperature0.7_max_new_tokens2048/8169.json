  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation described by \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function in time. We investigate the causal relationships under the application of the Fourier Transform \\\\( F \\\\), a complex integral transformation defined for function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Fourier Transform to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and analyzing the transformed function over time without any further modification provide the same outcome as the direct application of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier Transform changes the function from time domain to frequency domain, which alters the characteristics and behavior of the original function. Applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and to the Fourier Transformed version of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will generally yield different results because \\\\( L \\\\) may interact differently with these representations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function x(t) is transformed into y(t) via the linear operator L and into X(f) via the Fourier Transform F. Applying L to x(t) results in y(t), while applying F to x(t) results in X(f), which can then be transformed back via the inverse Fourier Transform to potentially yield y(t) if L is a Fourier-preserving operator."
