  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The role of the Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) on this system is analyzed.\n\nIf the Laplace transformation is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) immediately after solving the differential equation without any modifications, will the transformed result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) for some s in the complex plane be the same as directly solving the Laplace transform of the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transformation directly to the solution of the differential equation or to the equation itself leads to the same result because the Laplace transformation is a linear operator and it transforms the differential equation into an algebraic equation in the s-domain, preserving the characteristics of the linear system represented by the differential equation.",
