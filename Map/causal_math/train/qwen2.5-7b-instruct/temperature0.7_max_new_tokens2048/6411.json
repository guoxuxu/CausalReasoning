  "Problem": "Consider a functional relationship expressed as a complex integral transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} h(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a known time domain signal and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the impact of a Laplace transform on the signal's properties.\n\nIf an operator modifies the signal \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by a scaling transformation \\\\( k * h(t) \\\\) and then applies the Laplace transformation, will the resultant function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) depend solely on the scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity of the Laplace transform, scaling the input signal \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by \\\\( k \\\\) scales the output \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by the same factor. Therefore, the transformed function directly reflects any scalar multiples applied to the original signal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
