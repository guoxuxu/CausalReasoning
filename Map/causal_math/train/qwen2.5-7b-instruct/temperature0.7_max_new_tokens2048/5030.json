  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}t^z \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. The integral is an example of a complex function involving a Mellin transform.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) for some z, can we uniquely determine the value of s without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( h(z) \\\\) might correspond to multiple values of s, especially considering the integral's dependency on the real part of s for convergence. There could be ambiguity due to complex conjugates or other factors within the structure of the s-plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
