  "Problem": "We consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the impact of a transformation \\( h(z) = Mz \\) applied at time t, where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf \\( h(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\( h(z) \\) changes the initial vector to \\( Mz_0 \\), so the evolving solution under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) starts from \\( Mz_0 \\) instead of \\( z_0 \\). Unless M commutes with \\( e^{Dt} \\), the vector \\( z(t) \\) will not be the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under \\(\\dot{z} = Dz\\) will result in z(t) being different from directly evolving z_0 to t=T under \\(\\dot{z} = Dz\\) due to the initial change induced by h(z)."
