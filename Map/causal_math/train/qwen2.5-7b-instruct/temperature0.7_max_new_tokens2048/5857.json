  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) applied as a transformation on a time-dependent signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), producing a new signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\). Where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. This scenario explores the relation and transformation effect with and without interventions such as changing the frequency or applying a damping factor.\n\nBy directly evolving the transformed signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\) from time 0 to T without any additional changes, will \\\\(y(T)\\\\) be identical to merely scaling \\\\(x(T)\\\\) with \\\\(e^{i \\\\omega T}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) is consistently applied through the duration, equivalent to scaling \\\\(x(t)\\\\) by \\\\(e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) at each point in time. Therefore, at time T, \\\\(y(T)\\\\) is just \\\\(x(T)\\\\) scaled by \\\\(e^{i \\\\omega T}\\\\), as no additional transformations interfere.",
