  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) satisfy the system of differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\). The system is subjected to a Fourier transform defined as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), where \\( Z(s) \\) is the transformed function in the complex s-domain.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at \\( t = t_1 \\) where \\( x(t_1) \\) and \\( y(t_1) \\) are forcibly altered, but the structure of the differential equations remains intact, will \\( Z(s) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) reflect changes due to this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The manual alteration of \\( x(t_1) \\) and \\( y(t_1) \\) changes the future trajectory of \\( z(t) \\), consequently altering its Fourier transform \\( Z(s) \\). Since \\( Z(s) \\) reflects the entire timeline of \\( z(t) \\), any such interventions change its overall profile in the s-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
