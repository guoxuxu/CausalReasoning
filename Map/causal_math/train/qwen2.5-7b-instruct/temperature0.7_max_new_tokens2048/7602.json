  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a linear transformation \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) is the initial vector. We examine the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(y) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}y(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) starting from t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(y) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(y) \\\\), the effects of B integrated over time obscure the original effects of A alone on \\\\( y_0 \\\\). Consequently, \\\\( y_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) due to the mixed influences of A and B.",
