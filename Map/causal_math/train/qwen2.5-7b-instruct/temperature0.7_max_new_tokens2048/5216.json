  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a step function. We apply the Laplace transform to this signal and analyze various influence scenarios within the Laplace transform space.\n\nConsidering a modified Laplace transform post-intervention exhibiting characteristics of both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\delta\\\\), can we definitively trace back whether the intervention altered the frequency at a specific time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the modified Laplace transform indicates changes in frequency, pinpointing the exact moment of intervention (the precise \\\\(T\\\\)) just from the transform is ambiguous. It would require additional temporal data or constraints beyond what the transform itself can provide.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The step function u(t) and the angular frequency ω directly influence z(t). The intervention involving δ modifies the Laplace transform, potentially altering the frequency at time T."
