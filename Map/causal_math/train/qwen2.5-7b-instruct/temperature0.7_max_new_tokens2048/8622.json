  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional space where we deal with the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace Transform. We analyze the causality and effect relations within signals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and their Laplace Transforms \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\).\n\nGiven a Laplace Transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at some \\\\( s = T \\\\), can we always uniquely determine the original time function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that generated it?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the necessary and sufficient conditions are fulfilled for the function and the Laplace transform to be well-defined and inversely transformable, yes, it is possible to uniquely determine the original time function. The Laplace Transform is a bijective operation in its domain of interest, mapping each unique time-domain function to a unique complex function in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform X(s) of a signal x(t) depends on the value of s, and given X(s) at a specific s = T, we can infer information about x(t), though unique determination of x(t) from X(s) alone may not always be possible due to potential non-uniqueness in the inverse transformation."
