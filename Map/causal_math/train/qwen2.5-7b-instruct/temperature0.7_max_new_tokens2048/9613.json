  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the effect of two linear transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = az \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = bz \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are non-zero complex constants, on the mapping described by \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f \\\\) is applied, does the resulting value \\\\( f(T_1(z_0)) \\\\) equal \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) fundamentally changes when \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is scaled by \\\\( a \\\\). Specifically, \\\\( f(T_1(z_0)) = (az_0)^n = a^n z_0^n \\\\), and this is not necessarily equal to \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) unless \\\\( a^n = 1 \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T_1 \\\\) alters the output of \\\\( f \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T1(z) to z0 and then applying f results in f(T1(z0)), which is equivalent to f(az0); however, without knowing the specific values of a and n, we cannot conclude that f(T1(z0)) equals f(z0) directly."
