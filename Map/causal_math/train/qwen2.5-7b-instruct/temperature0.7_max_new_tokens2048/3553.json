  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-s^2} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) represents an input function. We study the role of transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) on input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and observe its impact over the interval [0, a].\n\nIf the input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is modified by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x) = g(x) \\\\) at x = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given integral transformation, will \\\\( y(a) \\\\) for a given a > 0 be the same as if the original \\\\( u(x) \\\\) was used without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation will yield different results since \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) alters the input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) across the domain [0, a]. The specific properties of \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\) will interact differently with the squared term, leading to variations in the integral result.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of u(0) after modification by g(x) influences u(x), which in turn affects y(x) through the integral transformation. Since g(x) modifies u(x) at x=0 and this change propagates through the integral, y(a) will differ from the case where the original u(x) was used without modification."
