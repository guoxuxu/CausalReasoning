  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system under a specific transformation, where \\( z(t) \\) represents a complex function of time \\( t \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), with \\( \\omega \\) constant. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is utilized to study the system's frequency domain characteristics.\n\nIf an intervention is made by changing the frequency \\( \\omega \\) to a new value \\( \\omega'\\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the Laplace transform uniquely reflect this frequency change across all times?",
  "Explanation": "The modification at \\( t_1 \\) introduces a discontinuity, resulting in a Laplace transform that reflects both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega' \\) in different parts of the frequency spectrum. The transform is now a composite that indicates multiple characteristics rather than a single unaltered behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in frequency ω to ω' at time t_1 directly causes a change in the complex function z(t), which in turn affects the Laplace transform L{z(t)}."
