  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then let to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) alters the magnitude of the complex number, modifying its trajectory from the outset. As \\\\( k \\\\) increases or decreases the magnitude exponentially, the evolved state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), differs in magnitude compared to direct evolution under the differential equation alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly causes z(t) to evolve over time under the differential equation dz/dt = iωz. Applying the transformation g(z) at t=0 changes the initial value to g(z), which then directly causes z(t) to evolve over time under the same differential equation."
