  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a linear operator in a complex function space. We investigate how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely whether interventions (either the Fourier transform or its inverse) were employed, by observing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The indistinguishable effects that different transformations can have on the function's state by T (due both to their nature and the linear operator M) introduce uncertainties that prevent a clear determination of which transformations were applied just by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The spectral components could be similarly affected by diverse transformation paths.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T influences its value at a later time T+Δt; applying the Fourier transform to z at time T influences the value of z at time T."
