  "Problem": "Assume a linear transformation in a vector space governed by the matrix equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We are considering the impact of applying another linear operator transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = Mx \\\\) at time t=0, where \\\\( M \\\\) is also a linear operator.\n\nGiven only the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine the transformations (\\\\( F(x) \\\\) or \\\\( G(x) \\\\), or both) applied to the system, merely from knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the commutative properties of the linear operators and their exponential action over time, it is not feasible to discern the particular interventions applied just by observing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Multiple different transformation paths can yield the same \\\\( x(T) \\\\) owing to the superposition and compositional variability of linear transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear operator L to the initial state x(t) over time t leads to the final state x(T). The transformation M applied to the initial state x(0) results in the initial state at t=0."
