  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\\\), where x(t) is the input signal and X(s) represents the transformed signal in the s-domain. We examine the effect of modifications to the system's behavior through convolution with a kernel h(t) resulting in a new output y(t) given by \\\\(y(t) = (h * x)(t)\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original signal x(t) from y(t) in the time domain without knowing h(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of h(t), it is impossible to retrieve x(t) from y(t) because the convolution with h(t) fundamentally alters the signal, and different h(t) could lead to similar y(t). Deconvolution requires knowing H(s) to solve for X(s) from Y(s) = H(s)X(s).",
