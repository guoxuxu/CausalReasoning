  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a closed container, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity constant. We investigate the effect of a spatial transformation \\\\( u' = T(u) \\\\) where \\\\( T \\\\) is a rotation matrix.\n\nIf the initial velocity field \\\\( u_0 \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) at time t = 0, and subsequent evolution follows the given fluid dynamics without further intervention, will the state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under standard fluid dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The rotation matrix \\\\( T \\\\) changes the initial orientation of the velocity field. This alteration modifies the directional properties and therefore the trajectory of the flow under the non-linear term \\\\( (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial velocity field u_0 directly causes the state u(t) at time t through standard fluid dynamics. The initial velocity field u_0 also directly causes the transformed velocity field u' via the transformation T. The transformed velocity field u' directly causes the state u(t) at time t through the fluid dynamics."
