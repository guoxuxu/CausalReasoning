  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\), identifying how this transformed state evolves over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) evolved from \\\\(F(u_0)\\\\), can we accurately determine the initial state \\\\(u_0\\\\) without knowledge of whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial condition underwent a Fourier transform, recovering the original \\\\(u_0\\\\) from \\\\(u(T)\\\\) requires the inversion of both the Fourier transform and the action of \\\\(L(u)\\\\). Without knowing about the application of \\\\(F\\\\), it is infeasible to accurately retrieve \\\\(u_0\\\\).",
