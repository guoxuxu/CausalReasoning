  "Problem": "Consider the system described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). The system is analyzed for the impact of multiplying by a polynomial function \\\\( p(t) = t^k \\\\) and then taking the Laplace transform again. Here, \\\\( k \\\\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( q(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant) is multiplied to \\\\( h(t) = t^k g(t) \\\\) and the transform \\\\( Q(s) \\\\) is taken, will \\\\( Q(s) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( p(t) = t^k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) yields \\\\( Q(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{\\\\lambda t} t^k g(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{d^k}{ds^k}G(s - \\\\lambda) \\\\), demonstrating dependency not only on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) but also on the initial function \\\\( t^k \\\\). The final expression is influenced significantly by both \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\).",
