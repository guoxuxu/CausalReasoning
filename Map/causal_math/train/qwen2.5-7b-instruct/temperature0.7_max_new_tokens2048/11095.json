  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a linear time-invariant system where the complex impedance (Z) of the circuit is formulated as \\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} \\), and s is the Laplace transform variable. We explore the effects of adding a parallel capacitor with impedance \\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\) to this system.\n\nIf after adding the capacitor, a series resistor is added at the time \\( t_1 \\), will the final impedance purely be a function of the original values and the resistor, ignoring the effects of the capacitor?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a series resistor modifies the system's overall impedance, but it cannot negate the capacitive effect already introduced. Thus, the final impedance is a function of both the resistor and the capacitor, alongside the original circuit characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
