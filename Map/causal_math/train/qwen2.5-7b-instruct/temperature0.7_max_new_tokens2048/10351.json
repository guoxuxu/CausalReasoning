  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a complex plane, influenced by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int e^{Rt}z dt \\\\) (where R is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only be influenced by the differential equation and not the transformations (both T and S)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the applied transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\). Each transformation contributes additional integrated effects that are compounded with the differential equation's influence, significantly altering the trajectory and the final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The differential equation Pz → z(t) influences the evolution of z(t) over time. The integral transformations Qt → T(z) and Rt → S(z) introduce changes to z(t) but do not affect the evolution governed by Pz. Applying S(z) at t_1 does not influence the final state z(T) for T > t_1 once the evolution according to Pz has completed."
