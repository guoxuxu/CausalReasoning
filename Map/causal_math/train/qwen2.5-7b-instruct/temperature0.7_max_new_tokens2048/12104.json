  "Problem": "Analyze a control system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. The system's state is manipulated by a transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Dt}u \\\\), where D is a matrix. The manipulation occurs over time t and has implications for the evolution of the state.\n\nIf \\\\( h(u) \\\\) is initially applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was merely evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Dt}u \\\\) alters the initial state, which modifies the evolution trajectory of \\\\( u(t) \\\\). The action of \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) can change how the state is transformed under the differential operator L, leading to a distinct state outcome at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(u) applied to the initial state u_0 at t=0 and then evolved under the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu from t=0 to t=T results in the same state u(t) as evolving u_0 under the same PDE from t=0 to t=T without the initial transformation."
