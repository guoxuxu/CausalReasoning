  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we precisely determine what transformations were applied (either \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\), or both) based solely on the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that complex exponential transformations may differ only by a phase, different combinations of transformations and initial conditions can lead to the same endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\). The non-uniqueness of the solutions in the presence of interventions like \\\\(k(z)\\\\) and initial transformations \\\\(h(z)\\\\) means that multiple valid transformation sequences could result in the same observed state at time T.",
