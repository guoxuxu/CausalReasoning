  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( R(z) = z + c \\\\) (where c is a constant complex number) is applied, will the outcome of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( s \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( R(z) \\\\) adds a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\) to the function, altering both the form and trajectory of the integral transformation onwards from \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Thus, the final state of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) reflects the influences of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( s \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\), and not solely \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) is directly influenced by ω and s, while an intervention R(z) changes z(t) but does not affect the dependence of T(z) on ω and s. Therefore, for T > t_1, the outcome of T(z(T)) depends on ω and s but not on c."
