  "Problem": "Consider a system following a complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sT} ds \\cdot x \\\\), where T is a constant matrix and x is a constant complex vector. The function \\\\( g(z) = Uz \\\\) is a unitary transformation applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where U is a constant unitary matrix.\n\nConsidering the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing that an intervention occurred at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we definitively determine whether the unitary transformation \\\\( U \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after the application of a unitary matrix can result from various potential unitary transformations due to the nature of unitary matrices preserving the norm but potentially altering other characteristics of the vector. Thus, specific identification of U from the endpoint alone remains ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
