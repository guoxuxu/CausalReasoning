  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation described by \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function in time. We investigate the causal relationships under the application of the Fourier Transform \\\\( F \\\\), a complex integral transformation defined for function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf you observe the outcome after applying \\\\( L \\\\) on the Fourier Transformed \\\\( x(t) \\\\), can you unequivocally infer the form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Once \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed via the Fourier Transform and operated on by \\\\( L \\\\), reconstructing the exact original form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) requires reverse applying the respective transformations accurately which is not straightforward without knowing specifics about how \\\\( L \\\\) interacts with the frequency components of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
