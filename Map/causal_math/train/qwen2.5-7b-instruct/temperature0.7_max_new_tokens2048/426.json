  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impacts of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the function over time, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we accurately determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t in [0, T] without knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, the effects of the exponential transformation complicate the back-calculation to the original state. The transformation alters the trajectory in a way that is distinct from the natural evolution dictated by the differential equation alone.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt) is caused by the angular frequency ω and the complex constant λ. The transformation g(z) depends on the real constant α, which in turn influences the trajectory of z(t)."
