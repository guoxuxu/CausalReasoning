  "Problem": "In the context of control theory, consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the state-space equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is the input matrix. We examine how the integral transformation defined by \\\\( x_{new}(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) impacts the system's behavior with respect to input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nAssuming \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied from t=0 and evolves under the system dynamics without any further external modification, does \\\\( x_{new}(t) \\\\) differ from the response \\\\( x(t) \\\\) obtained by directly integrating the state-space equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( x_{new}(t) \\\\) represents the convolution integral of the system's impulse response with the input, which is exactly the solution provided by solving the differential equation directly. Thus, they are equivalent, highlighting the causality in the definition of the system's dynamics in response to \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Input u(t) and matrices A, B directly cause both x(t) and x_{new}(t). The integral transformation defined by x_{new}(t) incorporates the effects of A and B over time, thus influencing x_{new}(t) differently than the direct integration for x(t)."
