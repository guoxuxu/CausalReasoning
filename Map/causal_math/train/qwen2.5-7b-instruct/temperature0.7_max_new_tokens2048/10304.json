  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Mx \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the final solution vector \\\\( x(T) = Mx' \\\\) where \\\\( x' \\\\) is a solution to \\\\( A'x' = b \\\\), can we accurately determine if the matrix A was modified during the process or if only the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Both the original matrix A altered to A' and the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) would affect the final state. Determining the specific contributions of A's modification or M alone to the final solution \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not possible without additional information beyond the final state, as multiple configurations could yield the same result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation Mx' directly causes the final solution vector x(T). The equation A'x' = b, which represents an altered system, directly causes the original system equation Ax = b through matrix equivalence."
