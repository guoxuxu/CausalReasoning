  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) and its inverse.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\) an inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be solely dependent on the operator \\\\( iA \\\\) applied in \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) following the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the inverse Fourier transform at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the state from the frequency domain back to the time domain, introducing additional complexity. The subsequent evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) still depends on the transformed state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and so \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not solely depend on \\\\( iA \\\\) but also on the specifics of the transformation states prior to intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The operator iA influences z(t) through the differential equation. The Fourier transform F(z) converts z(t) to Z(ω), and the inverse Fourier transform converts Z(ω) back to z(t). An intervention on the inverse Fourier transform affects z(t) which then determines z(T)."
