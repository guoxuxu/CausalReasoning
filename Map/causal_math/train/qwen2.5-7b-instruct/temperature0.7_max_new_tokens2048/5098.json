  "Problem": "Suppose we have a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. Consider the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) where M is a square matrix, at various times.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the exact initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if we don't know whether transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\), it's difficult to determine if the observed state results directly from the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), or from \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). Multiple initial states can lead to the same observed state depending on whether and which transformation was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
