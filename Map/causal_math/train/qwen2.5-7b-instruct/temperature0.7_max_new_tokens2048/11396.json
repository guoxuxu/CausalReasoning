  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit involving a resistor, inductor, and capacitor in series, governed by the second-order linear differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C} i = 0\\\\). Suppose a voltage transformation given by \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\) is applied to the circuit, where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the behavior of current \\\\( i(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine with certainty whether the impedance was changed at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) or earlier, based only on the value of \\\\( i(T) \\\\) and ignoring the specific voltage transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without detailed knowledge of when the impedance change occurred, or the specifics of the voltage transformation, there are multiple possible configurations (time of impedance introduction, values of impedance, voltage parameters) that could lead to the same observed current at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "i(T) → impedance change; v(t) → i(t); L → i(t); R → i(t); C → i(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The current i(T) at time T causally influences whether an impedance change occurred at or before time t_1, through its dependence on the circuit components L, R, and C, and the applied voltage v(t)."
