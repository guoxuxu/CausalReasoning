  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. An intervention is applied via a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(t)\\\\), with h(t) representing a controlled input function.\n\nCan we uniquely determine, based on \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) alone, whether the intervention was modified from \\\\(h(t)\\\\) to \\\\(h'(t)\\\\) at some \\\\(t_1\\\\), knowing only the form of \\\\(h'(t)\\\\) and not \\\\(h(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) results from complex interactions between the initial conditions, the operator L, and the changes in interventions. Several different scenarios involving changes from \\\\(h(t)\\\\) to \\\\(h'(t)\\\\) could yield the same final state, especially without precise knowledge of the original intervention \\\\(h(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(t) directly influences g(u) through the transformation g(u) = u + h(t). The partial differential equation ∂u/∂t + L(u) = 0 describes the evolution of u, and the state u(x,T) at time T reflects the effect of g(u) and L(u). Knowing u(x,T) alone is insufficient to determine if h(t) was modified to h'(t) at some t_1 without additional information about h(t) or h'(t)."
