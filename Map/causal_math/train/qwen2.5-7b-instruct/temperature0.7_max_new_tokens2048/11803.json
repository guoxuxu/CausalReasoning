  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a region R with boundary condition specified by \\\\( u(x,0) = x^2 \\\\). The impact of applying a transformation described by multi-dimensional Fourier transform \\\\( F(u(x,y)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,y) e^{-i2\\\\pi xy} dx dy \\\\) on the function is examined.\n\nGiven the transformed system's solution at y = Y, can we precisely determine the operations (either only the Fourier transform, inverse transform, or both) applied, solely based on observing this state?",
  "Explanation": "The state at y = Y, resulting from complex interactions of transforms with the system's dynamics, cannot conclusively reveal what transformations were applied previously. Multiple transformations can yield comparable endpoints, especially given the integrals and inverse operations involved, making it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition u(x,0) = x^2 results in the transformed function F(u(x,y)), which when evaluated at y = Y gives u(x,Y)."
