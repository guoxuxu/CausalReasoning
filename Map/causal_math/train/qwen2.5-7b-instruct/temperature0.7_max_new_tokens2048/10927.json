  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation through a Laplace Transform given by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). The impact of manipulating \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) (a complex number in the Laplace Transform) on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is studied.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) at a specific time to a different constant \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and then \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is computed, will the location of poles in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depend only on the latest value \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not on the initial \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform reflects the state after the intervention; thus, the poles (indicative of system stability and behavior) in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depend on the post-intervention frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Previous values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) do not affect the resultant transform assuming a stationary process and no memory of past states.",
