  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We will explore scenarios using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as an integral transformation \\\\( L(g)(t) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} g(s) ds \\\\) with constant \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) initially and then is subjected to the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) without further manipulation, does the result depends solely on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) of the function \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z_0) = e^{az_0} \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) into \\\\( L(f)(t) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} e^{as} ds \\\\). Since this operates under integration where \\\\( a \\\\) remains a constant, the resultant function after applying \\\\( L \\\\) depends only on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) of \\\\( f \\\\), and not directly on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) itself after the integral transformation.",
