  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant. We analyze the influence of performing an inverse Laplace transform under the scenario of differentiating the impulse response associated with H(s).\n\nIf an external function \\\\( \\\\gamma(t) \\\\) is applied as a convolution to the original impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) before differentiating, will the resultant function depend only on 'a'?",
  "Explanation": "When an external function \\\\( \\\\gamma(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( h(t) = e^{at}u(t) \\\\) before differentiation, the resultant form of the function changes based on the properties of \\\\( \\\\gamma(t) \\\\). Although 'a' remains a factor in shaping the response, \\\\( \\\\gamma(t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics, hence the final form isn’t governed solely by 'a'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transfer function H(s) influences the impulse response h(t), which when differentiated yields h'(t). The application of an external function γ(t) through convolution with h(t) produces a new function that, when differentiated, depends on both h'(t) and γ(t), but not solely on 'a'."
