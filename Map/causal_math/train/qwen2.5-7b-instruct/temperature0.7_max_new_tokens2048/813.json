  "Problem": "We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), on its related differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is derived by applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the temporal evolution is analyzed under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\) without intervention, does \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T represent the initial transformation accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) captures the frequency components, and the evolution by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\) translates into a modification in these components as \\\\( X(\\\\omega, t) = X(\\\\omega)e^{-at} \\\\). The Fourier transform at any time t = T correctly incorporates this exponential decay factor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
