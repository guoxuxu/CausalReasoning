  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is considered, which affects the function over time span [0, T].\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformations introduce damping and potential phase shifts that can result in similar effects on the function from different initial transformations. This overlap and the lack of one-to-one correspondence between the input functions and the damping effects they apply make it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions from the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The constant frequency ω influences z(t), which in turn affects the derivative dz/dt. The function z(t) is transformed into f(z), which influences the transformed endpoint ẑ(T)."
