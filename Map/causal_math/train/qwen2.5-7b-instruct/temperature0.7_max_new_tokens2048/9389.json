  "Problem": "Imagine a complex system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{Ct} z dt \\\\) on the behavior of the system over time T.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T mirror that of a directly evolved \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) integrates the evolution of the system over the interval, aggregating multiple evolutionary states, not just from an initial point but effectively averaging out the transformative effects across the interval due to the exponential matrix factor. This alters the trajectory from simply evolving under \\\\( Cz \\\\), resulting in a distinct state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
