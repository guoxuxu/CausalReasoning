  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix representing mechanical dynamics. Additionally, consider a transformation applied to the state described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}\\\\)z, where D is another constant matrix and t represents time.\n\nIf an intervention employing a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 solely rely on M and ignore the effects of D and F?",
  "Explanation": "The further intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the system state yet again, adding another layer impacted by F in addition to D and the ongoing influence of M. These changes cumulatively influence the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), reflecting contributions from all matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z at time T is influenced by M through the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), but the transformations g and h do not affect this relationship directly. The interventions with D and F alter the initial state or the path taken to reach z, but the long-term behavior of z is primarily determined by M."
