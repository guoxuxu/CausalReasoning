  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At} x \\), where \\( x \\) is a complex vector and \\( A \\) is a complex square matrix. Evaluate the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another complex matrix, on this function over a period \\( T \\).\n\nIf \\( I(z) \\) is computed after \\( z(t) \\) has evolved up to time \\( T \\) without any other operations, does the result solely depend on the initial vector \\( x \\) and the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\( I(z) \\) under these circumstances is directly influenced by \\( x \\), \\( A \\), and \\( B \\) through the integration and matrix exponentials. The linearity and continuity of the integral and exponential operators ensure that the influence of \\( x \\), \\( A \\), and \\( B \\) is straightforwardly propagated through \\( z(t) \\) to \\( I(z) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x, through its evolution governed by matrix A, influences the function z(t). The integral transformation I(z), guided by matrix B, further modifies z(t) to produce the final result, which depends solely on x, A, and B."
