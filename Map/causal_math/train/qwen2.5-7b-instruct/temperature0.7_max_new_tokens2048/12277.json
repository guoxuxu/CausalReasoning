  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by the differential equation \\\\( V' = -RCV \\\\), where V is the voltage, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance in the circuit. Analyze the impact of the Laplace Transform, defined by the function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(t)) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}V(t) dt \\\\) over the time domain variable t, where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(t)) \\\\) at a complex number s, can we accurately deduce the original voltage function \\\\( V(0) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform aggregates information over all time, encoding it into a function of s. Extracting specific time-domain data like \\\\( V(0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(t)) \\\\) uniquely is non-trivial without inverse transformation and additional boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resistance R and capacitance C directly cause changes in the rate of change of voltage V; the complex number s influences the Laplace transform of the voltage V; the Laplace transform L(V(t)) at s does not directly determine V(0) without additional information."
