  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Fourier transform on a time series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and consider an operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to it. We consider the variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the frequency domain with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), the output from filtering \\\\( X(s) \\\\) with \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine the original time series \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific filter used, \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) requires knowledge of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) since deconvolution in the frequency domain depends on dividing \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) with \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Without knowing the filter, it is not possible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original time series X(t) is transformed to X(s) via the Fourier transform; X(s) is filtered by H(s) to produce Y(s); Y(s) is the output after filtering and can be transformed back to x(t) if H(s) is known."
