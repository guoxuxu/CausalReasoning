  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\(R(z) = Bz\\\\) where \\\\(B\\\\) is another complex constant matrix is applied at an intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the end state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on \\\\(\\omega\\\\) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(R(z)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces components from matrix \\\\(B\\\\), which modifies the trajectory initiated by \\\\(A\\\\). The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is thus dependent on both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) in addition to the inherent parameters of the system such as \\\\(\\omega\\\\). The matrix interactions and their sequence play critical roles in determining the outcome.",
