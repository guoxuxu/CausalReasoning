  "Problem": "In a study of fluid dynamics, let \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid on a plane, subject to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\). We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nCan we determine what additional terms (like damping) were added during the evolution by merely observing the Fourier transform of the outcome \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, T) \\\\) and knowing the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "Although changes in the Fourier domain hint at modifications in the dynamics, ambiguities due to possible overlap between natural system dynamics and introduced terms prevent exact back-calculation of interventions. There might be multiple valid explanations for observed changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The velocity field u(x, t) influences its Fourier transform mathcal{F}(u)(k, t), which in turn influences mathcal{F}(u)(k, T). The partial differential equation PDE dictates the behavior of u(x, t) and thus affects mathcal{F}(u)(k, t)."
