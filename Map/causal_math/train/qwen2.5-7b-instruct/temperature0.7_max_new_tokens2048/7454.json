  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) on a function \\\\( w \\\\) in the complex plane over time t. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) after time T, is it possible to deduce whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) was applied to the initial state \\\\( w_0 \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) and only observing the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\), the initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined. The effect of the complex exponential transformation in the initial phase could mask or modify any changes in a manner indistinguishable from effects solely due to the matrix A.",
