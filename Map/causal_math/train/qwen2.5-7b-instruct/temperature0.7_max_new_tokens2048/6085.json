  "Problem": "We examine a fluid dynamics setting where the flow velocity vector field \\\\(\\\\vec{v}(x, y, z, t)\\\\) is influenced by the Navier-Stokes equation under an applied external force \\\\(\\\\vec{f}(x, y, z, t)\\\\). Consider the complex transformation of the force field, defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(s, y, z, t) = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\vec{f}(x, y, z, t))(s)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) denotes the Laplace transform in the x-direction.\n\nDoes the application of the Laplace transformed external force \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(s, y, z, t)\\\\) at time t = 0 lead to a directly proportional change in the flow velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}(x, y, z, t)\\\\) at time t = T under the unaltered Navier-Stokes equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed force field \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(s, y, z, t)\\\\) affects the system indirectly since the velocity field's response is governed by both the original and transformed properties of \\\\(\\\\vec{f}\\\\) through the Navier-Stokes equation. This causal relationship is mediated by complex dynamical processes, making proportional change not straightforward.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
