  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is a constant vector. We evaluate the impact of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) at time t, where E is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of the transformations due to non-commutative matrix operations and similar resulting state trajectories. This overlap makes it impossible to conclusively pinpoint which transformations were applied just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T is influenced by the initial value z, the transformation h applied to z, and the transformation k applied to z. Both transformations h and k lead to z(T) through z."
