  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time control system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We investigate the role of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, in influencing the state evolution over time.\n\nIf a control input \\\\(u\\\\) is introduced at a later time \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the system dynamics as \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), and the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was initially applied, will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at T > t_1 be affected by the interaction of B with M?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a control input \\\\(u\\\\), along with the initial application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), makes the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) dependent on how matrix B interacts with the continuous effects of matrix M, as well as matrix A, modifying the trajectory throughout the entire interval.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
