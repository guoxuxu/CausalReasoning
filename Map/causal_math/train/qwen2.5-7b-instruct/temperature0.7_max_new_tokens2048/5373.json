  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t)\\\\,dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( w(t) \\\\). This transformation modifies how we analyze the behavior of signals and systems in engineering and physics.\n\nIf \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a function representing a physical signal modified to \\\\( w'(t) = w(t) + h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is another function, will the Laplace transform \\\\( z(w') = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w'(t)\\\\,dt \\\\) be identical to the transform of \\\\( w(t) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( z(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of the signal by adding \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies its original form, therefore changing the result of the Laplace transform. This transformation is linear but sensitive to changes in the function it acts upon, resulting in a different transform outcome than that of the unmodified \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The addition of h(t) to w(t) to form w'(t) causes the Laplace transform z(w') to differ from the original transform z(w)."
