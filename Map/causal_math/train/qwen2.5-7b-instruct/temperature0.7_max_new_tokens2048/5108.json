  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of an electrical system characterized by the function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the initial voltage and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Let \\\\( T(V) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty V(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) describe a Laplace transformation of the voltage signal over time.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( T(V) \\\\) post-intervention, can we determine unequivocally whether an intervention took place, and if so, specifically identify \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\) or its characteristics, solely based on \\\\( T(V) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\) could result in similar alterations to the Laplace transform of the voltage function. Without more specific information about the time or nature of the intervention, it is impractical to uniquely identify \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\) just from \\\\( T(V) \\\\). Different types of interventions might mask each other or produce cumulative effects that are indistinguishable in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial voltage V_0 and the parameter s directly cause the voltage signal V(t). The voltage signal V(t) transforms into the Laplace domain to produce T(V), which is influenced by V(t)."
