  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the effect of performing a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) given by \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\), and analyze how transformations affect the function over time and complex frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for a specific \\\\( s \\\\) be the same as the direct Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved to the same time under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) changes the function from time domain to frequency domain, which inherently involves a transformation of the system properties. The differential equation behavior in the frequency domain differs from the time domain one, as it involves complex operations on the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), adjusting the dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z(t) with respect to time is Mz, and the Laplace transform of z(t) at s is Z(s). Applying the Laplace transform to z(t) results in Z(s), which, when evolved under the differential equation without further intervention, remains equivalent to the direct Laplace transform of z(t) evolved to the same time."
