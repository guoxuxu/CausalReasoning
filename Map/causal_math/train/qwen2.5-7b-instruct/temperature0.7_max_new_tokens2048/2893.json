  "Problem": "Examine a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) with an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\), where L represents a linear differential operator. We consider the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition.\n\nDoes transforming the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0(x)) \\\\) and then evolving according to the PDE change the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t compared to evolving \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition changes the representation of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) into frequency space, thereby modifying how the differential operator L acts on it through its differential properties. This can lead to a different solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) compared to the direct evolution of the untransformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0(x) directly influences the solution u(x, t) through the PDE. Applying the Fourier transform to u_0(x) results in a new initial condition that also directly influences u(x, t). The linear differential operator L governs the evolution of both initial conditions over time."
