  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Mx \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) is applied to an initial solution vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) which satisfies \\\\( Ax_0 = b \\\\), and the transformed system \\\\( AMx = b \\\\) is solved without further interventions, will the solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) still satisfy the original equation \\\\( Ax = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) changes the solution space of the equation. Unless M commutes with A and specifically maps solutions of \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) to other solutions, the new solution will generally not satisfy the original equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Since M is invertible, if Mx_0 satisfies AMx = b, then x_0 satisfies Ax = b. Therefore, the solution x(t) obtained from solving AMx = b will also satisfy Ax = b."
