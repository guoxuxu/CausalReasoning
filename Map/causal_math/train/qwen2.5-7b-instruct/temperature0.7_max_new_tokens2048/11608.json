  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is used to analyze its frequency components.\n\nBased on observing specific peaks in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega_1 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_2 \\\\), can one uniquely determine if a specific cosine function was added to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( y(t) \\\\) during an intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of peaks at particular frequencies in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) suggests periodic influences but doesn't uniquely attribute these to modifications in either \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Both components can contribute to the frequency content, and without additional time-domain information, specific interventions cannot be uniquely identified.",
