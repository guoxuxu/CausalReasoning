  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) defined over time, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We investigate the role of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), representing an integral transformation.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially and then evolve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under its defined dynamical system without additional manipulations, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be affected solely by parameters A and B over time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) being an initial transformation does not alter the dynamical governing equations of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The evolution at any time T is entirely determined by the matrices A and B, regardless of the initial transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Parameters A and B respectively govern the evolution of x(t) and y(t) over time, which in turn define z(t). Applying the Laplace transformation L to z(t) initially does not affect the subsequent evolution of z(t) under the dynamical system defined by A and B."
