  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is subjected to the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the given differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) to \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha 0}z_0 = z_0\\\\). However, as the solution progresses, the factor \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) modifies the evolution trajectory from what it would be under the untransformed differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\). Thus, \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will differ because it incorporates the effects of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) as well as \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
