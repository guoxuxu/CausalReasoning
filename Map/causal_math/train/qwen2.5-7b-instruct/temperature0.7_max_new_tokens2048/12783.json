  "Problem": "Imagine analyzing the influence on a solution space by the operator \\\\( T: V \\\\rightarrow V \\\\) in the context of linear algebra, where T is defined as \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) for a matrix A and S is a linear subspace of V which is invariant under T. Consider the subsequent application of a transformation \\\\( f(x) = Bx \\\\), where B is another matrix, to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in S.\n\nGiven the observed state at a later time t = T, can we unambiguously determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) purely based on the end vector?",
  "Explanation": "The final vector could potentially result from different transformation paths due to different initial states or differing sequences of applications of B, C, and interactions through T. The interplay and non-commutative nature of applying these matrices prohibit unequivocally determining the sequence or specific transformations applied based just on the end state observed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
