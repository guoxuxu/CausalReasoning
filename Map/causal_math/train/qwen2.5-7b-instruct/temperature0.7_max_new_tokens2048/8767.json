  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapped to a vector field by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is studied on the plane transformed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer.\n\nIf during the evolution under \\\\( g(z) \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) is applied at a specific instant \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final outcome \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) be influenced entirely by \\\\( C \\\\), regardless of \\\\( m \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) adds another layer of transformation. The final state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) is dependent not only on \\\\( C \\\\) but on how \\\\( z \\\\)'s trajectory is further altered by \\\\( z^m \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). This intervention disrupts the straightforward influence of \\\\( C \\\\) alone, reflecting compounded effects of \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "g(z) → g(z(T)); f(z) → z^n; h(z) → z^m",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final outcome g(z(T)) is influenced by C through the evolution of g(z), and is not directly affected by m or n unless they are part of the initial conditions or constraints of z. An intervention h(z) = z^m at a specific instant t_1 may indirectly influence g(z(T)) through changes in z, but this influence depends on the relationship between m and the evolving state of z."
