  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\), represented by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\nIf an additional Fourier operative, represented by a filtering process \\( h(s) \\), is applied to transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\), will the resulting output be fundamentally dependent only on \\( \\omega \\) and not the initial condition \\( z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a filter \\( h(s) \\) adds another layer of transformation, making the filtered output dependent not just on \\( \\omega \\), but also significantly on \\( z_0 \\). The initial conditions and the specific nature of the filter would influence the resultant spectral composition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The output is fundamentally dependent only on ω and not z_0 because z_0 directly influences z(t), z(t) directly influences the Fourier transform F{z(t)}(s), and h(s) filters F{z(t)}(s) but the result does not depend on z_0."
