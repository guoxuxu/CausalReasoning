  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process where the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx = Ax \\\\, dt + B \\\\, dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) refers to a Wiener process increment. An operator \\\\( T_t \\\\) defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is constant is considered as a transformation.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( T_t \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the use of the transformation \\\\( T_t \\\\), tracing back to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) becomes ambiguous, particularly because the stochastic element and the potential matrix transformation obscure the path taken by the system starting from the initial condition.",
