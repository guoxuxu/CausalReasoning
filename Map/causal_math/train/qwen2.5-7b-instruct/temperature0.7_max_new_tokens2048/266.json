  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which is modeled by the Laplace Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)] = \\\\frac{1}{s-2} \\\\), to transfer into the frequency domain. We manipulate the function with an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(f)(s) = f(s+1) \\\\). We then explore the changes back in the time domain, represented by the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the function in the time domain obtained after applying \\\\( T \\\\) and performing the inverse transform, can we confirm if this function was initially the result of applying \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-2} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation merely shifts the argument and multiple different functions could produce the same result after the application of \\\\( T \\\\), it's impossible from the final function alone to verify with certainty the original function or the application of \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) in the time domain results from applying the integral operator T to the function 1/(s-2) in the frequency domain, and 1/(s-2) in the frequency domain is the result of applying the inverse Laplace transform to the function z(t) in the time domain."
