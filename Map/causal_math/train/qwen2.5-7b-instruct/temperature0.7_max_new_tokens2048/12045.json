  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represent a complex function governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Consider the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then exploring the causal relationships between different transformations applied to \\\\( z \\\\) at various times.\n\nCan we revert to the precise initial form \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by inverse transforming \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) back to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), without knowing the specifics of the transformation applied (e.g., the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform requires knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to accurately reconstruct the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Without this, the phase and frequency characteristics embedded in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) hinder accurate reconstruction of the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z with respect to time t (z(t) → z'(t)) is directly influenced by the complex constant ω, and applying the Laplace transform L to z(t) results in Z(s), which can be inverse transformed back to z(t) without needing the specific value of ω."
