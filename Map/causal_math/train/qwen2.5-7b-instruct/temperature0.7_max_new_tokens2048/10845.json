  "Problem": "Consider the flow behavior of a fluid characterized by the complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\), where \\\\( w(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\) represents a complex potential in the z-plane. Analyze the effect of a conformal map \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is a complex function and evaluate its implications on the fluid flow.\n\nIf the conformal map \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\) is applied to the initial fluid flow pattern defined by \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to the usual fluid dynamics equations without further intervention, will the flow pattern at t = T be the same as if the fluid flow had been directly evolved from \\\\( w(z) \\\\) to t = T without the map?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the conformal map alters the geometry of the domain which impacts the behavior of the fluid flow. Since the fluid dynamics are sensitive to boundary conditions and domain shape, the transformation \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\) changes these conditions, thus affecting the consequent behavior of the fluid at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z = e^f(w) → new flow pattern; new flow pattern → evolution according to fluid dynamics equations; evolution according to fluid dynamics equations → flow pattern at t = T",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the conformal map \\( z = e^{f(w)} \\) to the initial flow pattern \\( w(z) \\) results in a new flow pattern, which then evolves according to fluid dynamics equations over time, leading to a flow pattern at time \\( t = T \\)."
