  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where its Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), with constants a and b. We assess the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) under different transformations and alterations to the original Laplace transform equation.\n\nIf we modify the constants a and b to a' and b' respectively, and then calculate the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + a's + b'} \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) at x = T be the same as the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T without any change to a and b?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constants a and b to a' and b' alters the poles of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), which affects the form of the inverse Laplace transform. Therefore, the time-domain representation \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) will differ from \\\\( z(x) \\\\), as these parameters directly influence the damping and oscillatory behavior of the resulting function.",
