  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. We assess the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform applied to both components x(t) and y(t).\n\nGiven the final observed states at time T, can we unequivocally ascertain whether a Laplace transform, a Fourier transform, or both were applied during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Since both transformations affect the spectral content of the system in distinct yet potentially overlapping ways, the final state may not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the type or sequence of transformations applied. The compounded effects of the transforms make it difficult to disentangle them based solely on the outcome at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
