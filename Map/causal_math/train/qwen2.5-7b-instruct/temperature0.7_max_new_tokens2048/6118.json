  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected in series, described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = E(t) \\\\), where \\\\( q(t) \\\\) is the charge and \\\\( E(t) \\\\) is an external voltage source. The relationship to be studied involves examining the behavior of this RLC circuit under the transformation of an applied impulse response function denoted as \\\\( F(t) = e^{-st} \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original charge \\\\( q(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( q(T) \\\\), without knowing whether an impulse response \\\\( F(t) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( F(t) \\\\), the transformation can render the initial condition \\\\( q(0) \\\\) untraceable by solely observing \\\\( q(T) \\\\). The exponential factor in \\\\( F(t) \\\\) may affect the state in a non-reversible manner without additional data or constraints on the system's dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An external voltage source E(t) influences the charge q(t); the inductance L affects the second derivative of charge with respect to time, resistance R affects the first derivative of charge with respect to time, capacitance C inversely affects the charge, and an impulse response F(t) modulates the external voltage source E(t)."
