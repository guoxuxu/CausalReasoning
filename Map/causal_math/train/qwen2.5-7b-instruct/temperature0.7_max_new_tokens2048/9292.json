  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{(iBt)}z\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another real constant, on the behavior of the function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations that were applied at different times is not feasible just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The phase shifts introduced by the coefficients \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) and the possibility of overlapping effects from these transformations complicate the unique identification of the interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
