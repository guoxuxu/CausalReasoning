  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) describing heat distribution along a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) with constant diffusivity k. Investigate the implications of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x, t)e^{-i\\\\omega x}dx \\\\) applied to this model.\n\nCan the specific intervention \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) be determined from the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), given knowledge of the heat distribution at T and the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Deciphering \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) alone is impossible because different interventions might produce similar transformations of heat distributions at time T. The overlap in possible spectral effects from various filters obfuscates direct inference of specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Heat distribution u(x, t) changes over time ∂u/∂t and space ∂²u/∂x², with the rate of change of heat distribution ∂u/∂t directly caused by the spatial second derivative k∂²u/∂x². Applying the Fourier transform to u(x, t) yields hat{u}(ω, t), which at time T is hat{u}(ω, T), and the final state hat{u}(ω, T) is influenced by the intervention g(ω)."
