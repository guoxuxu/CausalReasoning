  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an additional signal shaping function \\\\( h(x) = e^{-bx^2} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) is applied during the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(x)f(x) \\\\), will the resultant spectrum be solely influenced by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and not by \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces another level of signal shaping, which influences the final spectrum alongside \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) together alter the signal’s spectrum by their combined filtering effects, resulting in a convolution of effects in the frequency domain.",
