  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(q)(\\\\omega) \\\\) of the product \\\\( q(x) = p(x)h(x) \\\\) is known, can we determine \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing what \\\\( p(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge about \\\\( p(x) \\\\), especially its parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the Gaussian function, it's impossible to accurately deconvolve \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(q)(\\\\omega) \\\\) to retrieve \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). The result literally depends on the extent and nature of modification by \\\\( p(x) \\\\).",
