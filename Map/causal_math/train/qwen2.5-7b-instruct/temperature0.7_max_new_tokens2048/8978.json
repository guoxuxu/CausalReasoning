  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) evolved under \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\) without knowing about any transformation, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of stochastic integral \\\\( dB_t \\\\) introduces randomness into the system, making it impossible to accurately backtrack the exact initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) due solely to the information at time T, particularly without explicit knowledge of applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in X_t over time (dX_t) is caused by the current state of X_t, the constant matrix A, and the Brownian motion B_t. The state X_t at time T is a result of its initial state X_0 evolving according to the given stochastic differential equation. Therefore, without additional information or constraints, the initial state X_0 cannot be conclusively determined solely from the final state X(T)."
