  "Problem": "Assess the causal relationship in a vector field defined by \\\\( z(x, t) = Ax + tBx \\\\) where A and B are fixed matrices and x is an input vector. An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{sC}z(x, s) ds \\\\) is applied to z(x, t), involving a matrix C.\n\nIf an additional operation, such as \\\\( G(z) = e^{Dt}z(x, t) \\\\) where D is another matrix, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( T(z) \\\\) only depend on the effect of G and ignore the transformations induced by A, B, and C?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing G does not isolate the effects of A, B, and C; rather, it adds another layer of complexity. The resulting outcome \\\\( T(z) \\\\) reflects a mixture of influences from A, B, C, and now D, complicating direct attribution to a single cause or matrix.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → z; B → z; C → T; D → G",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A and B determine z, which is then transformed by T. D influences G, which operates on z at time t1, but the outcome of T(z) is independent of G and focuses solely on the effects of A, B, and C."
