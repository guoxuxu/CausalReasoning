  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nKnowing the final state \\( u(T) \\), can we determine without ambiguity whether the Fourier transform or the intervention by M was applied, just by examining \\( u(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potentially complex interaction between the Fourier transform, the differential operation by L, and the exponential scaling by M, multiple function evolutions could yield the same \\( u(T) \\). Disentangling whether M, the Fourier transform, or both were used in reaching \\( u(T) \\) is not feasible just from the final form of the function, especially without initial condition information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator L transforms u(x) into -u''(x), the Fourier transform converts u(x) to U(ω), and M intervenes to change u(x) to u(T)."
