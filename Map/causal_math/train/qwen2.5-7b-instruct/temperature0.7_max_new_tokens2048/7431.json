  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\\\). This transformation is applied to a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int h(x) K(x, s) dx \\\\). Investigate the effects of the transformations and their reversibility across different conditions.\n\nIf an additional transformation, \\\\( p(x) = x^2 h(x) \\\\), is applied to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) before the integral transformation, is the effect observed in \\\\( g(s) \\\\) purely determined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) irrespective of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation modifies \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to \\\\( p(x) \\\\), which when used in the kernel transformation changes the nature of the output \\\\( g(s) \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is influenced both by the nature of \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) and the quadratic transformation, meaning the outcome is not determined purely by the kernel.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation p(x) → g(s) and h(x) → p(x) indicate that p(x) is derived from h(x) through the transformation p(x) = x^2 h(x). The integral transformation K(x, s) → g(s) shows that g(s) is influenced by the kernel K(x, s) after integrating over h(x). Therefore, the effect on g(s) is not purely determined by K(x, s) alone but also depends on the transformation applied to h(x) to obtain p(x)."
