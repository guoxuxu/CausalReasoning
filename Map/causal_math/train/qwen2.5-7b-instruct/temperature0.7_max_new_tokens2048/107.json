  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional space where a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y)) \\\\) influences particle trajectories. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation defined by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), which rotates vectors by a fixed angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( L' \\\\) (rotates vectors by a different angle \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the subsequent trajectories of particles depend solely on the original vector field without considering the influence of \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( L' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces another layer of modification on the vector field. The particle trajectories after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) are now influenced by both initial transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( L' \\\\), making them dependent on the rotational properties of both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( L' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of transformation L' directly influences the subsequent trajectories of particles, while the original vector field v(x,y) also directly influences the trajectories."
