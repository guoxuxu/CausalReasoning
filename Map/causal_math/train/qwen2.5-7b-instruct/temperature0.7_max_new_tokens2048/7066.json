  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), known as the wave equation. We explore the influence of a Fourier transform applied initially (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\)) and how it impacts the propagation of the wave over time.\n\nFrom the wave profile at time T, can we uniquely reconstruct the original wave profile \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of the Fourier transform, it is not possible to accurately reconstruct \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\). The transformation could significantly alter the initial frequency characteristics, and some information about the phase and amplitude could be irreversibly modulated by the dynamics of the wave equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
