  "Problem": "Consider a system involving variables \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(z\\\\) with the relationship governed by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The impact of altering variable \\\\(x\\\\) through a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) further with another function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, will depend on matrices A, B, and C due to the compound effects of both transformations applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) influenced by both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) will alter the input to the integral transformation, leading to values in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) that are a consequence of cumulative transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
