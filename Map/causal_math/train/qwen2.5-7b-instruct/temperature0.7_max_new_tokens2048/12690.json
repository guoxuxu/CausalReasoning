  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and i is the imaginary unit. We study the influence of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nSuppose that at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), another integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{B(t-s)}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) (where B is another constant complex matrix) is applied. Will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be independent of the transformations applied by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The successive applications of the transformations summarizing as \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then \\\\( g(z) \\\\) with different matrices introduce complex interdependencies in the function’s evolution, thereby making the final state at T dependent on both A and B in a potentially non-trivial way.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
