  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F[z] = \\\\int e^{iBt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) over time interval [0, T], where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nBy observing the result of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we deduce the original function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowledge about the transformation \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation involves convolution with \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) which blends with the structural properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of the presence and form of \\\\( F \\\\), retrieving \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely from the outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is unfeasible due to loss of information and possible diverse solutions fitting the resultant transformation.",
