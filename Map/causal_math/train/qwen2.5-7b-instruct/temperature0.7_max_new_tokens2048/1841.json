  "Problem": "Assume a system where the Laplacian operator \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) governing heat distribution in a two-dimensional plane. Consider further if the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int u(x,y) e^{-x^2-y^2} dx dy \\\\) is applied to evaluate system behavior over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) is initially defined and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if initially \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was calculated at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) extracts certain features of the function that depend on the distribution of \\\\( u \\\\) which evolves over time. The action of \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) changes the spatial characteristics of \\\\( u \\\\), thereby altering the result of the integral transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u(x, y) evolves over time due to the Laplacian operator ∇², leading to changes in its partial derivative with respect to time ∂u/∂t. The integral transformation T(u) evaluated at different times reflects the state of u(x, y) at those times."
