  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Laplace transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\) with a constant matrix A on a complex function space. The transformed function is \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(s) \\\\). We will analyze the function after applying an inverse Laplace transform, possibly with an operational matrix M applied to it.\n\nIf an operational transformation given by an additional matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) is applied after inversely transforming \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(s) \\\\) to \\\\( g^{\\\\prime}(t) \\\\), will the end function \\\\( g^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}(t) \\\\) purely reflect the effects of matrix A without being affected by matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The operational transformation by \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) post inverse Laplace transformation will convey additional dynamics imposed by M. Thus, the resultant \\\\( g^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}(t) \\\\) represents a mixture of influences from both matrices A and M, altering the original dynamics characterized solely by A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function g(t) influenced by matrix A transforms to g'(t) via the inverse Laplace transform, and then g'(t) is further modified by matrix M to become g''(t). Matrix A directly affects g(t), while matrix M affects g'(t), but g''(t) does not purely reflect the effects of matrix A alone."
