  "Problem": "We consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) that maps complex numbers to complex functions, given by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function. We investigate the impact of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and examine the causal effects in the Laplace transform domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we determine precisely the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific transformation \\\\( t^2 \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific transformation applied (\\\\( t^2 \\\\)), reconstructing the exact original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is impractical. The additional \\\\( t^2 \\\\) term modifies the integral in such a way that unique inversion to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is obscured.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
