  "Problem": "Consider a system which can be modeled by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), shifting through complex numbers in a unit circle over time. An external transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nAssuming an intervention that further applies a transformation \\\\(g(z) = dz\\\\) (where \\\\(d\\\\) is another complex constant) at some \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the magnitude of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on \\\\(|c|\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state's magnitude at \\\\(T\\\\), given as \\\\(|cd e^{iT}|\\\\), will depend on the product of magnitudes \\\\(|c|\\\\) and \\\\(|d|\\\\). Thus, it is dependent on both values, not just \\\\(|c|\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The magnitude of z(T) for T > t_1 depends on |c| and |d|, but the intervention g(z) = dz at t_1 does not change the dependency on |c| alone after t_1."
