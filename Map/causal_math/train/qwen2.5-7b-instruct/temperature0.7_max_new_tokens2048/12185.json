  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t) \\\\), where P is a complex constant. We study the effects under the integral transform \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Qt}z(t)dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant and T is a fixed time.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) exactly after processing through \\\\( G(z) \\\\) without knowing the value of Q?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( G(z) \\\\) with unknown Q is impractical because the integral transform with \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) masks the original dynamics under exponential weights, which are critical to reverse the transformation accurately.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
