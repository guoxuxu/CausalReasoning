  "Problem": "Examine the influence of a nonlinear transformation \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant, on a discrete dynamical system \\\\( w_{n+1} = z(w_n) \\\\). Evaluate how these changes affect the behavior of sequences generated by this dynamic system over iterations.\n\nAfter observing a sequence generated by the dynamics of \\\\( z(w) \\\\), is it possible to unequivocally determine the initial value \\\\( w_0 \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex and potentially chaotic behavior introduced by the quadratic transform, multiple different initial conditions can lead to similar sequences or behavior, particularly in the presence of attracting cycles or Julia sets, making back-calculation complex.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value w_0 directly influences w_n through the iterative transformation z(w_n), which in turn directly determines w_{n+1}. The complex constant c affects the transformation z(w) but does not directly cause changes in the sequence values without passing through z(w_n)."
