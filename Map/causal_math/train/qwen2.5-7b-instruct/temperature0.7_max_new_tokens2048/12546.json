  "Problem": "The system under study is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. The impact of an integral transformation represented by the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a kernel function, is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention by another convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast J \\\\), where \\\\(J\\\\) is a different kernel, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformation only depend on \\\\( L \\\\) excluding influences from \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( J \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( u \\\\) has already been affected by \\\\( K \\\\) due to the initial convolution, and applying \\\\( u \\\\ast J \\\\) introduces yet another convolutional influence. The resulting system's behavior by time \\\\(T\\\\) is a combined effect of \\\\( L, K, \\\\) and \\\\( J \\\\), with each contributing to the final state in a potentially interdependent manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of u over time (∂u/∂t) is influenced by L(u), and applying convolutions u * K and u * J can modify u, but the partial differential equation primarily describes the effect of L(u) on ∂u/∂t."
