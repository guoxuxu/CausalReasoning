  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We investigate the causal effects of operations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and their expression through the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine whether a scaling was applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) just by observing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "Again, since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) involves integration over time, extracting the precise moment and nature of interventions on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from subsequent values of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is inherently ambiguous. Changes to the integral could be the result of various different operations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), not necessarily identifiable as scaling at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
