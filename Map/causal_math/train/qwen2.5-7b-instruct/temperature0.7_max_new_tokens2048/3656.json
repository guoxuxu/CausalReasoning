  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + p\\\\frac{dz}{dt} + qz \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), on this function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some terminal s-domain point, can we accurately identify what interventions were applied (originating from \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), or both), just by analyzing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the transformed state \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is challenging without additional information about the sequence and nature of operations applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Similar transformations can result from various combinations of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), creating ambiguity in backward inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
