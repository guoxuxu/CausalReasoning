  "Problem": "Consider a linear canonical transformation system governed by complex function integration \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} w(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and w(t) represents an external input function. We explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( h(w) = \\\\int e^{Bt} w(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nIf a modifying function \\\\( j(w) = \\\\int e^{Ct} w(t) dt \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the transformations by B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( j(w) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the system, affecting \\\\( w(t) \\\\)'s contribution to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) beyond the influence of A alone. The modifications introduced by both B and C through their respective transformations dictate the ultimate behavior of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), resulting in a dependency on all involved transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The external input function w(t) influences the behavior of z(t), h(w), and j(w) through the matrices A, B, and C respectively. Introducing the modifying function j(w) at time t_1 does not affect the final output z(T) for T > t_1, given that z(t) is determined solely by A and not by B or C."
