  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation given by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\\\) where \\\\(W_t\\\\) is a standard Brownian motion, \\\\(\\mu\\\\) is the drift coefficient, and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) is the volatility coefficient. We explore the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( Z_t = e^{\\lambda t}X_t \\\\) for some constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\).\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( Z_t \\\\) over time, can we infer the exact value of \\\\( X_0 \\\\) without knowing the transformation constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\(\\lambda\\\\), the scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\lambda t} \\\\) applied to \\\\( X_t \\\\) to get \\\\( Z_t \\\\) is unknown. This ambiguity in the scaling factor means we cannot accurately back-calculate to find the exact value of \\\\( X_0 \\\\) from \\\\( Z_t \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
