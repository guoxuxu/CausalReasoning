  "Problem": "Investigate the stability of a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number denoting angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We consider the effect of an external transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( k(z) = dz \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the function form at any \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be solely determined by \\\\( w \\\\), regardless of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) alters the system's trajectory fundamentally, affecting both magnitude and phase based on the values of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\). The overall impact is dependent not just on \\\\( w \\\\), but also how \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) modify the system state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency w directly influences the function z(t) over time; the constants c and d directly influence z(t) and z(t_1) respectively."
