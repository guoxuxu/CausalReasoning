  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex number. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) transforms the system at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it’s uncertain if the transformation \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) influenced the initial state. Without this information, multiple original states \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could lead to the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially if \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) are not aligned.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
