  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the state of a system z(t) is transformed by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-iB)s} z(s) ds \\\\), where A and B are matrices, and i is the imaginary unit. This system's behavior under temporal evolution is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z(t) \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention at time t_1. Will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, only depend on the linear evolution through C and not be affected by the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or the intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces a new layer of transformation, compounded by the earlier application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Both these alterations, alongside the natural evolution dictated by C, shape the trajectory to the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent on A, B, C, and D, defining a path influenced by each transformation's properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on the initial state z(t) which is influenced by both the transformation h(z) and the intervention k(z). The linear evolution through C affects the rate of change of z but does not directly depend on the initial application of h(z) or the intervention k(z) after the initial time t_1."
