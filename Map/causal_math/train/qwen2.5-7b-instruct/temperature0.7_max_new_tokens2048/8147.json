  "Problem": "Consider a linear system subject to the equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where D is a constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of applying the transformation \\( T(x) = Lx \\) where \\( L \\) is a linear map represented by a constant matrix, and examining the behavior over a duration \\( t \\).\n\nIf a new transformation \\( U(x) = Mx \\) (where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\( t_1 \\), will the state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( D \\) and not on \\( L \\) or \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\( x(T) \\) is influenced by the initial transformation \\( L \\), the system dynamics \\( D \\), and the intervention \\( M \\). Both \\( L \\) and \\( M \\) affect how the state evolves from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\), introducing composite effects that vary depending on their interplay with \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
