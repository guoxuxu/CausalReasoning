  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and z is a complex-valued function of time t. Investigate the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is another real constant, on the evolution of z.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which interventions (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the interval [0, T], solely from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of interventions with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at different times, especially considering that these transformations can neutralize or reinforce each other depending on their application timing. The non-trivial interaction between exponential scaling and complex rotation introduces ambiguity in determining the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k directly causes the transformation g(z). The value of ω directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time. Time t directly causes both z and g(z). The initial value of z at time 0 directly causes the values of z and g(z) at any time t."
