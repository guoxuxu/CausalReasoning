  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t)dt \\\\. Analyze the causal impact on the transformed function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) given an intervention \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) with an additional function \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\).\n\nWill the Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of the function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) follow the standard transformation without any modification to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) throughout the time?",
  "Explanation": "Since there is no intervention or external modification to \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\), the Laplace Transform will strictly follow the standard transformation given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\), assuming ideal conditions without external influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
