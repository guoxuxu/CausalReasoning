  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by applying a complex Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-i\\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\). Analyze the impact of a linear differential operator \\\\( L = \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and how it affects the transformed function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the precise sequence and types of operations (whether \\\\( L \\\\) alone, \\\\( M \\\\), or both) applied on \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by just analyzing the final Fourier transform result?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant transformations and potential overlaps between different operations' effects in Fourier space make it challenging to conclusively determine what operations were applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from the final Fourier transform alone. Without discrete identification or additional information, multiple operation sequences could result in similar transforms.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
