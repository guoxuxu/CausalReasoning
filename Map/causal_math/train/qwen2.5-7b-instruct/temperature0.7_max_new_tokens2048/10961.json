  "Problem": "Assess the causal relationship in a vector field defined by \\\\( z(x, t) = Ax + tBx \\\\) where A and B are fixed matrices and x is an input vector. An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{sC}z(x, s) ds \\\\) is applied to z(x, t), involving a matrix C.\n\nWill the properties of the matrix A solely determine the output \\\\( T(z) \\\\) after applying the transformation over the interval [0, T], assuming only the initial setup without further interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T(z) \\\\), is affected not just by A but also by B and C through the dependencies in the integral transformation. The addition of tBx and modulation by e^{sC} ensures that matrices B and C also significantly influence the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
