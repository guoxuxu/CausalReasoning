  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant thermal diffusivity. An external heat source modifies this equation by a term \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\), making it \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + v(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf the system starts at initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and evolves based on the original heat equation without the external source term \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\), will the temperature distribution at a later time T, \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), be the same as if it evolved under the modified equation?",
  "Explanation": "The external source term \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) introduces an additional heating effect which alters the temperature distribution over time. Without this term, the system evolves differently, leading to a dissimilar temperature profile at any given time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
