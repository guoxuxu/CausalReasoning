  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the electric potential \\\\( V \\\\) in a region is governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 V = 0 \\\\). An external operator manipulates the boundary conditions or introduces additional charge densities \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\), which changes the solutions of the equation.\n\nIf at some point a function \\\\( \\\\rho_1 \\\\) is introduced to modify the charge density, will the resulting potential distribution \\\\( V(T) \\\\) strictly depend on the initial boundary settings and not the subsequent changes in \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention involving changing charge densities \\\\( \\\\rho_1 \\\\) directly affects the solution to the Laplace equation, making the resulting potential distribution \\\\( V(T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial boundary conditions and the modified charge density. Both aspects contribute to shaping the electrical field.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
