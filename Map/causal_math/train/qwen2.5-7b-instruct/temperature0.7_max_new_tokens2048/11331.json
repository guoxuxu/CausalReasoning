  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = (K * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is a kernel representing a transformation and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(t) = e^{At}K(t) \\\\) where A is a constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an additional modification \\\\( K''(t) = e^{Bt}K(t) \\\\) (where B is another constant) is introduced as an intervention, will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 represent only the effect of \\\\( K(t) \\\\) and not of \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive modifications to the kernel through \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) will collectively affect the integral transformation, and hence the output. Both modifications impact how the input is transformed, and their compounded effect makes the output dependent on both A and B along with the original kernel properties.",
