  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(\\ z = h(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\)\\), where x and y are variables modified by a transformation \\(\\ T(u, v) = (e^{Au}v, e^{Bu}v) \\)\\) dependent on parameters A and B.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\(\\ Q(w, z) = (w^3, z^3) \\)\\) is applied as an intervention at \\(\\ t_1 \\)\\), will the endpoint \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) for \\(\\ t > t_1 \\)\\) reflect only the effects of the original transformation \\(\\ T \\)\\) and not \\(\\ Q \\)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\(\\ Q(w, z) \\)\\) introduces additional modifications, making the final value of \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) dependent on both transformations \\(\\ T \\)\\) and \\(\\ Q \\)\\). The cubic transformation can significantly alter the values of x and y, affecting the output of \\(\\ h \\)\\) in ways varying from the original trajectory set by \\(\\ T \\)\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
