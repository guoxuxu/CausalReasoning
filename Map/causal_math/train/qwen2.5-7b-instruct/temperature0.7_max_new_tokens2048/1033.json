  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex scalar function z(t) governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\), where A and B are complex constants, and w is a real constant. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{Ct}z + D\\\\), where C and D are complex constants, at different points in time.\n\nIf transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T evolve identically as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\) without applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) alters the initial condition to \\\\(z_0' = e^{C0}z_0 + D = z_0 + D\\\\) due to the implementation of the transformation at t = 0. This modified starting point impacts both the magnitude and trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time, differing from the trajectory had no transformation been applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences z(t) through the evolution governed by \\(\\dot{z} = Az + B\\sin(wt)\\). Applying the transformation h(z) at t=0 changes z_0 to a new state, which then evolves differently under the same differential equation."
