  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\) without any further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(x) \\) initially transforms the state by a complex exponential factor, which affects the system’s trajectory. The transformation \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) introduces a rotation in the complex plane, altering the evolution of the state which is further compounded by the system dynamics under M, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(x) = e^(iωt)x to x_0 at t = 0 and allowing the system to evolve under M → x(t) for time t results in the same x(t) at t = T as directly evolving x_0 under M → x(t) for the same duration."
