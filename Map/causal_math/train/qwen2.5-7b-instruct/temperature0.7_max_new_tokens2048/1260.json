  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex constant, in the context of an integral transformation. We are particularly interested in the causality analysis between transformations and original functions.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform resulting from an operation involving A and an uncertain linear transformation M, can we unerringly deduce the exact form of M?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform is affected by the composition of A and M, leading to generalized forms that do not uniquely specify M. Different M matrices could yield similar effects on the transformation outcome, obscuring a direct determination of M from the Laplace transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
