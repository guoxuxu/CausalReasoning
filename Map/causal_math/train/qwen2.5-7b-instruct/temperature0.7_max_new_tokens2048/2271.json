  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network consisting of resistors and capacitors governed by the equation \\\\(V(t) = U(C, R, t)\\\\) where V is the voltage, U is a function of capacitor values (C), resistance values (R) and time (t). Let a transformation be defined by \\\\(f(V) = Z^{-1}e^{At}V\\\\), where Z is the impedance matrix and A is a diagonal matrix representing frequency-dependent behavior.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system’s impedance Z to a new value \\\\(Z'\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final voltage \\\\(V(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the new impedance and not by the initial transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(V(T)\\\\), while influenced significantly by the updated impedance matrix \\\\(Z'\\\\), is also dependent on how the initial state was transformed by \\\\(f(V)\\\\). Both the initial condition modified by A and the changes due to \\\\(Z'\\\\) will affect the system’s voltage at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final voltage V(T) is determined by the new impedance Z' and not by the initial transformation f(V). Impedance Z affects voltage V through time t, and a change in impedance to Z' at time t_1 influences the voltage V(T) for T > t_1."
