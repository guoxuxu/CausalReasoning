  "Problem": "Examine the causal impacts within a system described by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. The study involves the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s, x) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) on the function over time.\n\nIf a modification is made by an operator \\\\( H \\\\), changing the system to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (A + H)\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the solution at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) exhibit independence to changes in \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\\\( H \\\\) influences the system's evolution alongside \\\\( A \\\\), implying that the final solution at time \\\\( T \\\\) is dependent on both matrices. Any alteration in \\\\( A \\\\) post-intervention by \\\\( H \\\\) modifies the trajectory and consequently the solution at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → u; H → u; t1 → u; T → u",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of u at time T depends on the modifications introduced by H and the initial conditions through the evolution of the system from time t1."
