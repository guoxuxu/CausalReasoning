  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) on the complex plane, and we are studying its transformation through a complex contour integral \\\\(I(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u(z) dz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple, closed contour and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\\\(k\\\\) is increased by 1, resulting in a new function \\\\(u'(z) = z^{k+1}\\\\), and we compute the integral \\\\(I'(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u'(z) dz\\\\) without any other changes, will \\\\(I'(t)\\\\) evolve exactly as \\\\(I(t)\\\\) if \\\\(k\\\\) had not been changed?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the power of \\\\(z\\\\) in \\\\(u(z)\\\\) to \\\\(u'(z)\\\\) changes the nature of the function within the integral, contributing an additional factor of \\\\(z\\\\) which alters the contour integration results. This can significantly modify the evaluated integral, thereby affecting how \\\\(I'(t)\\\\) evolves compared to \\\\(I(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing k by 1 changes the function u(z) to u'(z) which in turn changes the integral I(t) to I'(t)."
