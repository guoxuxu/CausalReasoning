  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. The transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) with another constant matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) is applied to assess various impacts on the function.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "Upon applying the intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the trajectory of z will now also be influenced by R in addition to P and potentially Q. The transformations by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\) introduce additional dynamical elements, affecting the evolution and final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in a way that inherently depends on all three matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
