  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where the function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), with C being a real constant. The evolution of the system is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the differential equation and not on the initial transformation by \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics altering the endpoint, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on the differential equation process but also significantly on the integral transformations previously applied. The interaction between \\\\( e^{-iCs} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCs} \\\\) across different segments would produce compositional changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
