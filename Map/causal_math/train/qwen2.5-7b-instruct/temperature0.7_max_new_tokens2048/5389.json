  "Problem": "Consider a linear system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the implications of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the system, affecting the solution characteristics over time t.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the initial function into its frequency components, changing how the operator L acts on \\\\( u(t) \\\\). Since L may affect different frequency components variously, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time T will not generally match the untransformed evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F(u) to the initial function u_0 and then evolving under ∂u/∂t = Lu yields the same result as directly evolving u_0 under ∂u/∂t = Lu for the same duration."
