  "Problem": "Analyze a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied on an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) within a linear system governed by \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\). The concern here is how transformations and external interventions affect the evolution of the system over time.\n\nGiven only the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations were used, be it the initial application of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) or the intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\\\) at t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not inherently disclose the specifics about which transformations or interventions were applied due to potential overlaps in outcomes from various combinations of initial phase, frequency changes, and interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z_0, through the transformation e^(iωt), influences z(t). Additionally, the intervention h(z) = e^(iθt)z at t_1 also affects z(t), which then evolves to z(T)."
