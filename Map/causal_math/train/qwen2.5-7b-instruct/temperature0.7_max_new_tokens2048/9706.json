  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar frequency. Analyze the behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform result \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we conclude that the non-intervened function was exactly \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the unique correspondence between exponential functions and their Laplace transforms under conditions where \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\neq i\\\\omega \\\\), the inverse transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) recovers the original function uniquely as \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω determines the form of z(t), which is influenced by the time variable t. The Laplace transform L[z](s) of z(t) results in a function of s, and given L[z](s) = 1 / (s - iω), we infer that without intervention, z(t) was likely e^(iωt)."
