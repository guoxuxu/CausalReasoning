  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is different from \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the final transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) be affected solely by the new \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not by the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) will reflect both the impact of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the new \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). The transformation accumulates contributions from both intervals: from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T governed by \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Thus, it is dependent on both values.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
