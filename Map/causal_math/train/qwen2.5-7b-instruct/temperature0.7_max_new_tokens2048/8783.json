  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Let's analyze the effect of applying the Laplace transform with respect to time on the equation, transforming the wave equation into the s-domain.\n\nAssuming that an impulse or modification is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influencing \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\), and subsequently the system is again transformed by Laplace transform, will the final s-domain representation \\\\( U(s,x) \\\\) of the wave at time \\\\( t_2 > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original conditions modified by the impulse, disregarding the initial transform application at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final s-domain outcome not only depends on the modified conditions post-impulse but also on how the initial Laplace transform was applied, which could have altered the original state or introduced factors that persistently affect the evolution of the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
