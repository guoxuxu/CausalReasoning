  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) that governs the temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is a constant. We consider the impact of an initial condition modification \\\\(u(x, 0) = h(x)\\\\) and the application of a transformation \\\\(u(x, t) = v(x, t) + w(x, t)\\\\), where \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) solves the original PDE and \\\\(w(x, t)\\\\) is another function introduced as an intervention.\n\nCan we infer the exact function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) used to establish the initial condition at t = 0 by solely examining the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different initial conditions can lead to similar thermal states at a later time T due to the diffusion nature of the heat equation. Without additional information, reversing the time evolution accurately to retrieve \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is generally infeasible.",
