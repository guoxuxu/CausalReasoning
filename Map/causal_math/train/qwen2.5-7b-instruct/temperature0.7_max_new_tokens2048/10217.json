  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf initially we apply \\\\(f(z)\\\\) to each point \\\\(z\\\\) on contour C, and then compute the integral of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) around C, will this integral be the same as the integral of 1/(z-a) around C without applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the integrand significantly, transforming it from \\\\(1/(z-a)\\\\) to \\\\(e^{z^2}/(z-a)\\\\). This change alters values across the contour path, potentially affecting the result of the integral depending on the location of \\\\(a\\\\) and the nature of C.",
