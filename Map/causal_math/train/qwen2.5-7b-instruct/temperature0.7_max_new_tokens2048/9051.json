  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) represents a complex-valued function where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. This function is transformed by a complex exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf an intervention applies a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t}z(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original function and not on the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further modifies the phase and potentially the amplitude of the function, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the original function, as well as the effects of both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The presence of these transformations introduces additional rotations and scaling effects in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
