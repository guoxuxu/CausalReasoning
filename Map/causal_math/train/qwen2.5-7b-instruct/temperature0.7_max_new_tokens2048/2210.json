  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nAfter observing the transformed value \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) at some point, can we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z \\\\) successfully?",
  "Explanation": "Given the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane, multiple values of \\\\( z \\\\) can result in the same outcome due to the \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\) periodicity. Without additional information about the range or restrictions on \\\\( z \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely recover the original \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) = e^(iz) transforms the complex number z into a transformed value, and knowing this transformed value allows us to deduce the original complex number z."
