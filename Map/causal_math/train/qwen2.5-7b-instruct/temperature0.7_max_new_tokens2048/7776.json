  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a space defined by linear operators. We have the operators \\\\( L \\\\) for differentiation and \\\\( M \\\\) for multiplication by function \\\\( t^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the impact of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), on this setup.\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform result after applying \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and an unknown subsequent operation, can we deduce definitively which operation (\\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\) or another possible operation) was applied last?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform results, influenced by complex interactions of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) with any subsequent operation, do not uniquely determine what the last operation was. Different operations could produce similar transforms, making it impossible to specify without extra information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
