  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) evolving under the dynamics described by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) is a complex constant. The impact of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Qt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is another complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nAfter observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we deduce the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), the transformation via \\\\(e^{Qt}\\\\) might have altered the initial conditions such that reconstructing the original \\\\(z_0\\\\) uniquely is infeasible, particularly given the complex nature of \\\\(Q\\\\) and \\\\(P\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) is driven by P, and the transformation g(z) affects z(t) over time t. Knowing z(T) allows us to trace back to z(0) if g(z) was not applied, but this requires P and the absence of g(z)."
