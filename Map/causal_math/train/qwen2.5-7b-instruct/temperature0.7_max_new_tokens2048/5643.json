  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a controlled mechanical system whose state variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves under the influence of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) as described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Lx + K u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input represented by a function and \\\\( K \\\\) is a constant matrix dictating the influence of \\\\( u \\\\) on the state \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf an additional control force \\\\( g(t) = d(t)u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( d(t) \\\\) is a time-varying scalar function, is introduced as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the impact of the initial function \\\\( c \\\\) earlier mentioned cease to solely dictate the system’s behavior?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a time-varying control function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) means that the overall control effect is now the result of the interaction between \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\). The system’s evolution is jointly influenced by these parameters and not solely by \\\\( c \\\\) past the intervention point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t) and the control force g(t) directly influence the state variable x(t). The constant matrix K dictates the influence of u(t) on x(t), while the time-varying scalar function d(t) modifies g(t) which in turn affects x(t)."
