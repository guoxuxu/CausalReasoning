  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex number. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) transforms the system at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another constant complex number) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on the original transformation \\\\( P \\\\) and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another level of complexity to the system, affecting the ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Since both Q and R influence the dynamics through their own exponential transformations, the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on P, Q, and R.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t depends directly on P through the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), and indirectly through transformations by Q and R, but the state z(T) at T > t_1 will primarily reflect the effect of P unless otherwise influenced by external interventions."
