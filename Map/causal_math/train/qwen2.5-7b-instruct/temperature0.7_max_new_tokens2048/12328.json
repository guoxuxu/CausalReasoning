  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation is applied: \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a heating function.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied at t = 0, introducing a heat source modeled by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the system is allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at a future time T be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(u) \\\\) adds an initial heat distribution \\\\( h(0) \\\\) to the system. This additional heat affects the subsequent temperature distribution as it evolves, governed by the heat equation. Thus, the distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will include effects of the initial heating addition, differing from the evolution with no initial transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
