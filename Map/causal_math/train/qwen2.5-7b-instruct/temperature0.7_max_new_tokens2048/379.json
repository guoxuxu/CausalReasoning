  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a vector function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx}z(x)dx \\\\), commonly known as the Laplace Transform. We examine the impact of pre-multiplying the vector \\\\( z(x) \\\\) by a constant matrix Q before applying the Laplace Transform.\n\nIf, during the transformation process, an additional constant matrix R is used to alter the transformed function as \\\\( RZ(s) \\\\), will the final transformed state be independent of the initial matrix Q?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation state, represented as \\\\( RZ(s) \\\\), is still dependent on the initial matrix Q because the original modification by Q directly influences the resultant \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) before the secondary modification by R. Thus, both Q and R influence the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial matrix Q influences z(x), which in turn affects Z(s). The matrix R then modifies Z(s) to produce RZ(s). The final transformed state RZ(s) is dependent on both Q and R."
