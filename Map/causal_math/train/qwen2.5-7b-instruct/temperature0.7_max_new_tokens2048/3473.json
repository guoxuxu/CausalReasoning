  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\), where R is also a constant, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Rt}z_0 \\\\), which changes the initial conditions of the differential equation. As the function evolves, the evolution encompasses the influence of R, resulting in a trajectory that differs from one that starts directly from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the original equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) = e^(Rt)z to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under dz/dt = Pz + Q for time T results in z(t) being equivalent to evolving z_0 directly under dz/dt = Pz + Q from t=0 to t=T."
