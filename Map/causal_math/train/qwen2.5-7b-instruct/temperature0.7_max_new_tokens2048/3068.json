  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. Let us examine the impact of an integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, over the time interval [0, t].\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we conclusively determine which transformations (either \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both) were applied, just by knowing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) could result from various combinations of the transformations \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\), as well as natural evolution under \\( C \\). The effects of \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) may overlap or interplay in a way that makes it impossible to decipher precisely which transformations were applied.",
