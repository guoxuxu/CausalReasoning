  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where F(s) represents the transformed complex function. We explore the impact of modifying the function to \\\\( f(t) + tg(t) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is another function, on the Laplace transform over variable s.\n\nIf we initially modify \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) + tg(t) \\\\) and obtain the Laplace transform without further modification, will \\\\( L\\\\{f(t) + tg(t)\\\\} \\\\) be the same as \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} + L\\\\{tg(t)\\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By linearity of the Laplace transform, the transform of a sum is equal to the sum of the transforms. Thus, \\\\( L\\\\{f(t) + tg(t)\\\\} \\\\) equals \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} + L\\\\{tg(t)\\\\} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the sum of functions f(t) and t*g(t) is the sum of their individual Laplace transforms."
