  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t,x)]\\\\) at time t = T, can we recover the initial condition \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(0,x)]\\\\) without knowing any specific details about the spatial evolution or initial spatial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution equation in the frequency domain following the Fourier transformation remains linear and reversible for this unidirectional wave equation. The inverse Fourier transform applied to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t,x)]\\\\) adequately recovers \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(0,x)]\\\\), since the effect of time evolution under linear translation is known and invertible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
