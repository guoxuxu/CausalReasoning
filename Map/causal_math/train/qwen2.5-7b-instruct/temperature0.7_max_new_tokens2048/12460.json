  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Examining the impact of the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) changes the initial condition by applying \\\\(e^{Ct}\\\\) to \\\\(z_0\\\\), which affects the evolution path of both \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\). The structure of matrix C influences how these paths deviate from their original trajectories without the transformation, leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial values of x and y at t=0 (x(0) and y(0)) determine their respective values at any time t through the differential equations A → x(t) and B → y(t). The transformation f(z) = e^(Ct)z at t=0 does not change the evolution of x(t) and y(t) under the given differential equations. Therefore, applying f(z) followed by evolution under the differential equations is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 to t=T under the same equations."
