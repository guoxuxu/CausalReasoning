  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and it's operated on by the Laplace transform defined by the integration transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). We examine how the operations affect the function over time and how interventions alter its behavior.\n\nCan we deduce the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from the transformed function \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) value at a given \\\\( s \\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the frequency \\\\( w \\\\), it’s impossible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\). The transform encodes the function into the frequency domain that depends on \\\\( w \\\\) and losing this crucial information impairs causally linking back to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency w influences the time-domain function z(t), which in turn affects the Laplace transform L[z(t)]. The value of s influences the Laplace transform L[z(t)]. Knowing L[z(t)] at a given s does not allow deducing z(t) without knowing w."
