  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We analyze the system’s behavior when exposed to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = De^{Nt}z \\\\), where D and N are constant matrices and D is diagonalizable.\n\nKnowing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), just from the final state and knowing the original dynamic equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of parameters for D, N, F, and Q can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially since different matrices might not commute. The relationships between the transformations and the base dynamics introduce ambiguities that prevent uniquely identifying which transformations were applied just by looking at the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time (Mz → dz/dt) determines its final state (z(T)), which in turn influences the determination of the transformations applied (z(T) → determination_of_transformations)."
