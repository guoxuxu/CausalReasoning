  "Problem": "Assume that we have a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z(t + 1) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a linear operator represented by a matrix. We consider the modification caused by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = N^t z \\\\), where N is also a matrix representation of a linear operator.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve under the original model \\\\( z(t + 1) = Mz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T equal the state obtained by evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the model for T steps without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to the initial state modifies it by \\\\( N^t z_0 \\\\), which changes the trajectory of the system. The resultant state at any future time point, including t = T, will differ unless N and M commute, which is not generally the case.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) to the initial state z_0 and then evolving it under the original model z(t + 1) → z(t) for T steps will result in the same state as evolving z_0 under the model for T steps without any transformation."
