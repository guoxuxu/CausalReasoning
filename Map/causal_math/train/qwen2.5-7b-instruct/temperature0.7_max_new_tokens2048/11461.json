  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function scenario where the initial function is \\\\( z(t) = C t^2 + iD \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) being real numbers. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, with A being a real constant.\n\nAssuming the initial conditions apply at t = 0 and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolved without further external changes, will the complex function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly evolved under the same initial conditions but without the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) changes the initial state of the complex function exponentially. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduces an exponential factor dependent on time, distinguishing it from a standard quadratic temporal evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
