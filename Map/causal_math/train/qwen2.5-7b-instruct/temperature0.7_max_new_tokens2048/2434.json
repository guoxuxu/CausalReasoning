  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a system described by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where f(t) represents a function of time t. We explore the transformations of this function through multiplication by another function g(t), and how it impacts the system using another transform, the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) be accurately deduced from the Laplace transform of the product \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)f(t)\\\\} \\\\), given that no information about \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is available?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( g(t) \\\\), it is impossible to precisely retrieve \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)f(t)\\\\} \\\\) due to the convolution in the s-domain with an unknown function, which obscures the inversions and manipulations required to isolate \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
