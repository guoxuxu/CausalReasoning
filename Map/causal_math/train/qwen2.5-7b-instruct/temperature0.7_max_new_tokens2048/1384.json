  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + \\gamma \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider transformations of the form \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z + \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, merely by knowing the endpoint value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity arising from the additive and multiplicative nature of the transformations applied (\\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)), combined with their influence on the system's trajectory, means that multiple intervention combinations could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This makes it difficult to uniquely pinpoint which transformations were applied.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constants ω and γ determine the rate of change of z with respect to t (dz/dt). The constants α and β define the transformation f(z). The time T leads to the endpoint z(T). Knowing z(T) allows us to determine the applied transformations."
