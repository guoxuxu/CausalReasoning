  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex function equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. Investigate the behavior under the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, the modulating factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) could have altered the initial condition in a complex exponential manner. Because this changes the nature and magnitude of the trajectory, it isn't possible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) directly causes the value of z(t) at any time t. The constant α directly causes the transformation T(z) applied to z. The time t directly causes the value of z(t) after applying the transformation T(z)."
