  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), yielding a new function defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the functional relation \\\\( s \\\\) as it affects the behavior of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) over the complex s-plane.\n\nGiven the result of the Laplace transform, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) where s is assured to be a positive real number greater than 1, can we determine that this result came from a Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and under the conditions specified (s > 1 and s real), the original function must be \\\\( e^{t} \\\\). This is because the inverse Laplace of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) uniquely corresponds to \\\\( e^{t} \\\\), given the transform's specific properties and the absence of any other typical functional forms that would result in the same transformed expression under these conditions.",
