  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function z on an integral transformation defined by the integral operator T, where \\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\) over a contour \\( \\\\gamma \\) in the complex plane. Here, z is a complex number and \\( f(t) \\) is a function of the complex variable t.\n\nAfter observing an output from \\( T[f](z) \\) and knowing an intervention modified f(t), can we exactly pinpoint what the initial function f(t) was and the type of intervention applied solely based on the output?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple functions or different interventions could yield the same or similar output for a given z in the transformation \\( T[f](z) \\), particularly because the nature of complex exponential functions can mask unique characteristics of initial conditions in the integration, leading to indistinguishable results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T[f](z) depends on the function f(t), and an intervention on f(t) changes its form. Knowing the output of T[f](z) and that f(t) has been intervened upon does not allow us to exactly pinpoint the initial function f(t) or the specific type of intervention applied."
