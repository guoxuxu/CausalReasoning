  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function. We explore the impact of applying an additional operation defined by multiplying with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a complex function in the s-domain.\n\nIf \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at s = 0, resulting in \\\\( H(0)F(s) \\\\), and then the inverse Laplace transform is taken without further intervention, will the resulting time-domain function \\\\( h(t) * f(t) \\\\) be the same as \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution operation in the time-domain, represented by \\\\( h(t) * f(t) \\\\), fundamentally changes the resultant function, as \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alters the spectral components of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), thus modifying the output in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "H(0) → (H(0)F(s)); (H(0)F(s)) → h(t); (H(0)F(s)) → (h(t) * f(t))",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of H(s) at s=0, when multiplied with F(s), results in H(0)F(s), which inversely transforms to h(t). The product of h(t) and f(t) in the time domain is h(t) * f(t)."
