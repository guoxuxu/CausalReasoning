  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) is a constant. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) versus simply evolving \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) \\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the result is then evolved subject to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t be the same as directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under the given partial differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the problem space from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, where the governing equation transforms differently due to properties of the Fourier transform on differential operators. Direct evolution and evolution post-transformation are not equivalent processes in this context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
