  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\). Let's introduce a complex transformation represented by \\\\( p(x) = e^{i \\\\theta}x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number. Analyze the behavior of a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) within this framework.\n\nGiven the endpoint after applying \\\\( h \\\\), then \\\\( N \\\\), and followed by \\\\( p \\\\), can we determine exactly which linear transformations (\\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\), or both) were chosen, merely by analyzing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Determining back the exact transformations, particularly distinguishing between \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), from the final state only, would be difficult, if not impossible, without additional information. The resulting state vector is a product of all applied transformations, and multiple combinations of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) could yield the same final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying h(x_0) first transforms the vector x_0 linearly, then applying p to the result of h(x_0) rotates it, making it impossible to uniquely determine whether M or N was used without additional information."
