  "Problem": "Consider a complex mapping scenario given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, over the complex plane.\n\nBy observing the outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at some point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) knowing that \\\\( g \\\\) was applied initially without knowing a?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\) modifies the input by an unknown complex shift, multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could lead to the same \\\\( z_1 \\\\) under different values of \\\\( a \\\\), specifically any \\\\( z_0 \\\\) such that \\\\( z_1 = z_0 + na \\\\) for integers n, creating an ambiguity in determining the unique cause without additional information about \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of g(z) transforms z by adding a constant a, resulting in z + a, which is then input into f(z) for further transformation."
