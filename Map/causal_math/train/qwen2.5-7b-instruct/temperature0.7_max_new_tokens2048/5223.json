  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a function \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a transformation through a Laplace Transform, represented by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = X(s) \\). Afterward, an inverse operation is applied via \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{X(s)\\} \\) over numeric domain s, using a different parameter set \\( p \\).\n\nIf at a certain step in the transformation, a different parameter \\( p \\) was used for the inverse Laplace Transform instead of the standard one, will \\( x(t) \\) after \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{X(s); p\\} \\) at the end still match the original \\( x(t) \\) without alteration?",
  "Explanation": "Changing parameters \\( p \\) in the inverse Laplace Transform represents an intervention that alters the correct inverse correspondence to the initial Laplace Transform, thus modifying the output \\( x(t) \\) from its original state because of the parameter discrepancy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
