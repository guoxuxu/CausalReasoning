  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing the angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time is analyzed.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T without prior knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation adds a convolution-like effect which modifies the phase and amplitude, obscuring the original form. Without knowledge of how \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, recovering the exact initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) just from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) is unachievable.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at t=0 is determined by ω, which also influences the form of T[z](t). The observed form of T[z](t) at t=T provides information about ω and, consequently, about z(t) at t=0."
