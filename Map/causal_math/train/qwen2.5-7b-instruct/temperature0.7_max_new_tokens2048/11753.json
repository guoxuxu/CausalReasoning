  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing an electric voltage across a resistor in a circuit, governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\). The influence of the Laplace transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is examined to understand the circuit's behavior over time.\n\nObserving the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely identify the original function at t = 0 without knowledge of whether a Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform shifts the function to the complex domain, determining the precise pre-transform function just by observing the effects at t = T is not possible without knowing the intervention of the transform, due to potential alterations in phase and amplitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the voltage function z(t) at any time t=T causally influences its value at t=0, but without knowledge of the Laplace transform, this influence is indirect and does not allow for unique identification of z(0). The Laplace transform L{z(t)} directly influences Z(s), which represents the transformed voltage function."
