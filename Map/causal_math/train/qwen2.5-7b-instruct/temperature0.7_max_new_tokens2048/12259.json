  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine the effects of a linear fractional transformation \\\\( L(z) = \\\\frac{cz + d}{bz + e} \\\\), with constants \\\\( b, c, d, e \\\\) on the transformed function.\n\nKnowing the final output, can we determine whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\) or \\\\( I(z) \\\\) was applied first, or whether both interventions were used together?",
  "Explanation": "The final output could potentially be the same under different sequences of applying \\\\( L(z) \\\\) and \\\\( I(z) \\\\) due to the properties of complex functions and transformations. Disentangling the sequence of applications from final output alone is generally infeasible without additional constraints or information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
