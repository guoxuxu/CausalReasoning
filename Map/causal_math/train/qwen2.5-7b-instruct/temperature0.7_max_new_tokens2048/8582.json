  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} = Ku\\\\) with a constant coefficient K. Analyze the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(u) = Cu \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied to the initial condition.\n\nCan we establish the exact initial vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) by observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing if \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( h(u) \\\\), the transformation by C may change the initial condition in a manner that cannot be reversed uniquely. The system's linearity does not necessarily assist in distinguishing between an altered and an unaltered initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
