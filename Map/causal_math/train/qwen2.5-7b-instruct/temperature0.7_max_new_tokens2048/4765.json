  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function space such that \\\\( L \\\\) represents a Fourier Transformation, and we investigate the impact of an additional operator \\\\( M \\\\) which applies a convolution transformation with a fixed kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Fourier transformation to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) followed by evolution under the convolution operator \\\\( M \\\\) result in the same outcome as applying \\\\( M \\\\) then \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations matters. Applying \\\\( M \\\\) after \\\\( L \\\\) changes how the convolution interacts with the frequency components altered by the Fourier transformation, leading to different outcomes compared to first applying the convolution and then transforming.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
