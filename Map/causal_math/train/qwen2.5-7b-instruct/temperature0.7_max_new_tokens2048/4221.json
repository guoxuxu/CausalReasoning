  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) changes the initial conditions of both real and imaginary components of \\\\(z_0\\\\), affecting how the function evolves under the given differential equations. The phase factor introduced can shift the trajectory of the function, thus altering \\\\(z(T)\\\\) from what would have been if no transformation was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences z(t). The constant matrix A directly causes changes in both x(t) and y(t). Applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving z under A until t=T results in z(T), which is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under A from t=0 to t=T."
