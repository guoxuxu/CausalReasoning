  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\) where A is a constant matrix describing the system dynamics, B is the input matrix, and u is the control input. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, is applied to this system resulting in the transformed equation \\\\(sX(s) - x(0) = AX(s) + BU(s)\\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, without tracking the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\), can we definitively deduce the exact initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) or the control input function used?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and only observing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), it is impossible to unquestionably backtrack and determine both the precise initial condition and the exact input function applied. Multiple initial conditions and input functions can yield the same state at time T under the given system dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
