  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant. Let's focus on its behavior under the mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing an angular frequency, and t represents time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initialized at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and subjected to time evolution under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) at some later time T be the same as \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) changes the input to the function \\\\( g \\\\) over time, because it rotates the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Therefore, the output at time T, \\\\( g(e^{i\\omega T}z_0) \\\\), generally will not equal \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\), as the function involves a non-linear transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
