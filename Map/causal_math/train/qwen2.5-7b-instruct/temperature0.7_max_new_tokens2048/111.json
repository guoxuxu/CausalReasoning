  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is subjected to the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of another transformation \\\\(j(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a complex constant) is applied at time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), will the system's state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T solely depend on \\\\(i\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\(j(z)\\\\) introduces another transformation with a different scaling \\\\(e^{\\\\beta t}\\\\). The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is influenced by the initial transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\), the differential equation's inherent characteristics (\\\\(i\\\\omega\\\\)), and the intervention \\\\(j(z)\\\\). Thus, the endpoint state at time T will depend on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), showcasing combined effects of these parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
