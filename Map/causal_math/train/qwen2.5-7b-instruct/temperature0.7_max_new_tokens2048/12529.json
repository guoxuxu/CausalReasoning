  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a real variable y depends on x through the relation \\(y = x^2 + 2x + 1\\). We study the transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) and examine its impact on y, in the context of solving the related differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 2 \\).\n\nAfter observing \\( y = 16 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\), can we deduce whether g(x) was applied to a previous value of x without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( y = 16 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\) only reveals the current state, not how x attained that value. Since \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\) is not injective due to its quadratic nature, multiple transformations or direct evaluations might lead to the same \\( y \\), obscuring the causal path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
