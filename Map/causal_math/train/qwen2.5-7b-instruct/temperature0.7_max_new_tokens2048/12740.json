  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The function is modified by an integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt}z(t) dt \\\\), with B as another real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( G(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at the start and the result is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) integrates the effect of \\\\( e^{iBt}z(t) \\\\) over time, effectively changing the trajectory from its original. Since the transformation introduces integration over a path influenced by B, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from this new initial state will not coincide with the unaltered evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex value z_0 directly influences the state z(t) through the evolution equation z(t) = e^(iAt)z_0. Applying the integral transformation G(z) to z_0 at t=0 results in a new initial condition that, when evolved to time T, does not yield the same final state z(T) as directly evolving z_0 to time T under the given evolution equation."
