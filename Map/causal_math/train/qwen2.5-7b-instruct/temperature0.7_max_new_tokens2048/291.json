  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system expressed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then subjected to a Laplace Transform, transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{C}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\).\n\nIf an operational intervention of adding a dampening factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, is applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) remain unaffected for any value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a dampening factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) fundamentally alters the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), changing it to \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{-(\\\\alpha - i\\\\omega)t} \\\\). Consequently, the Laplace Transform also changes to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{C}{s + \\\\alpha - i\\\\omega} \\\\), indicating a dependency on the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) for the resultant in the s-domain.",
