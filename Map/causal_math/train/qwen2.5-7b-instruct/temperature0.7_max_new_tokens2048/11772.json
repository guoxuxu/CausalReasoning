  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem involving an initial matrix \\u0027X\\u0027. The function \\u0027f(X) = e^{At}X\\u0027 transforms \\u0027X\\u0027 over time \\u0027t\\u0027, where \\u0027A\\u0027 is a constant skew-symmetric matrix. This explores changes under the integral transformation using the Laplace Transform of \\u0027X\\u0027.\n\nIf \\u0027f(X)\\u0027 is applied at time \\u0027t = 0\\u0027 to an initial matrix \\u0027X_0\\u0027 and subsequently evolves without further transformations under natural properties, will the spectrum of \\u0027X(t)\\u0027 at \\u0027t = T\\u0027 be the same as without applying \\u0027f(X)\\u0027?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\u0027A\\u0027 is skew-symmetric, the exponential matrix \\u0027e^{At}\\u0027 is orthogonal. Orthogonal transformations preserve the spectrum of a matrix. Therefore, the spectrum of \\u0027X(t)\\u0027 remains unchanged regardless of the initial application of \\u0027f(X)\\u0027.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial matrix X_0 directly causes X(t), time t directly causes X(t), and time T directly causes the spectrum of X(T). Applying f(X) at t=0 transforms X_0 into X(t) which evolves without further transformations, thus the spectrum of X(T) remains the same as that of X_0."
