  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by a matrix \\( M \\) in a vector space and its effect on the vector \\( x \\). The transformation is then followed by an integral transformation represented by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\} \\), which is the Laplace transform of the vector function \\( x(t) \\).\n\nIf a matrix \\( N \\) is applied as an intervention to \\( x(t) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), resulting in \\( Nx(t) \\) before applying \\( M \\), will \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ M(Nx(t)) \\} \\) be the same as \\( MN \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( N \\) first still results in a linear combination, and thus \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) can be merged into a single transformation before applying the Laplace transform. As both operations are linear, \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ MNx(t) \\} = MN \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\}.",
