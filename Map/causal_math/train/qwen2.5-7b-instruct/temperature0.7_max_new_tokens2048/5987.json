  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its transformation by a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nIf an external time-dependent function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier Transform, will the outcome \\\\( F(z + w)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) still reflect characteristics solely of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without showing influence from \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding \\\\( w(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before the transformation results in the Fourier Transform of the combined function, \\\\( F(z+w)(\\\\omega) = F(z)(\\\\omega) + F(w)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Therefore, the transformed output at each frequency is influenced by both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\), not just \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alone.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Adding an external time-dependent function w(t) to z(t) before applying the Fourier Transform introduces additional components to F(z+w)(ω) that reflect characteristics of w(t), thus influencing the outcome to show some influence from w(t)."
