  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention using a function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a fixed complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) exclusively depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention adjusts the trajectory once more, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) contingent upon the effects both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) as they are additional influences that affect the system's trajectory after their respective application times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) is directly influenced by A and C. An intervention with k(z) at time t1 modifies z(t), but this change depends on C rather than B."
