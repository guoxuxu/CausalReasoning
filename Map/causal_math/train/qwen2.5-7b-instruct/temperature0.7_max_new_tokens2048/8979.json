  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Dt}X \\\\) is applied as an intervention, and the system then follows the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) \\\\), does the final output \\\\( F(X_t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( g(X) \\\\) alters the state of the system, which then affects how further dynamics unfold under the integral transform. Therefore, the final output \\\\( F(X_t) \\\\) depends on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\), due to the compounded impact of these transformations on the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
