  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{Bt} f(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan one precisely identify the specific transformations applied (both \\\\( T[w] \\\\) and \\\\( S[g] \\\\)) based solely on observing the state at z = Z?",
  "Explanation": "The output at z = Z is influenced by the combined effects of matrices A, B, and C within their respective transformations. The complex interactions and possible equivalence of different transformation combinations lead to ambiguity in reverse engineering the exact transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
