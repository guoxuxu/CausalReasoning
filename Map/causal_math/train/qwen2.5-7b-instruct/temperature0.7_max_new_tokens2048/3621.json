  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an alternating current (AC) described by the complex function \\\\(I(t) = I_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(I_0\\\\) is the initial current amplitude and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation with a Laplace operator defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt\\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at t=0 and then \\\\(I(t)\\\\) evolves under its original differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\(I(s)\\\\) at s=\\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\) be a valid representation of the current in the circuit over time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform to \\\\(I(t)\\\\) gives a representation of the circuit's current in the s-domain, which accurately reflects the behavior of \\\\(I(t)\\\\) over time if no modifications to the system occur. This analysis remains valid as it provides a comprehensive view of the system dynamics under the original configuration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial current amplitude and angular frequency of the alternating current (I(t)) determine its Laplace transform (I(s)) at a specific value of s, and the transformed current (I(s)) represents the frequency-domain equivalent of the time-domain current (I(t)), which can be used to analyze the circuit's behavior."
