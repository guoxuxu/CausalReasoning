  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in the domain describing a physical system. The transformation is defined by an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( v(x) = (T u)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} U(x, y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nCan we uniquely determine \\\\( u(x) \\\\) from the observed \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( u(x) \\\\) from \\\\( v(t) \\\\) requires the inverse operation of both \\\\( T \\\\) and the evolution under \\\\( A \\\\). Without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, multiple potential initial functions \\\\( u(x) \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( v(t) \\\\), especially when considering the variability introduced by the kernel \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x) is transformed by the integral transform T with kernel U(x, y) to produce v(x), and this transformation allows v(x) to be determined from u(x)."
