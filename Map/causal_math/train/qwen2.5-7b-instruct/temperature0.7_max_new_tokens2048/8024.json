  "Problem": "Consider a complex system defined by the equation \\( z' = Cz \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex function and C is a constant complex matrix. The system transformation is analyzed through the lens of the integral transform \\( L(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{Mt}z(t)dt \\) across time interval [0, T], where M is a constant complex matrix and T is the endpoint of the considered interval.\n\nKnowing the outcome \\( L(z)(T) \\) at T, can the specific types and timings of interventions (either \\( L(z) \\) or \\( H(z) \\), or both during their operational intervals) be distinctly identified just from \\( L(z)(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the convolution-like nature of these transformations involving exponential terms \\( e^{Mt} \\) and \\( e^{Nt} \\), it is challenging to disentangle and precisely identify from \\( L(z)(T) \\) the nature and timing of interventions. The overlapping effects and complexity introduced by M and N in their respective time intervals create ambiguities in mapping back to specific interventions solely based on the endpoint value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The type and timing of interventions through the system described by the differential equation (C → z') and the integral transform (M → L(z)(T), z → L(z)(T), T → L(z)(T)) can influence the outcome L(z)(T) at time T."
