  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\alpha s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition before the evolution by adding a scaled integral transform effect, which affects both the amplitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The resulting state at T significantly differs because the initial addition via \\\\( g(z) \\\\) does not evolve as merely \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency w directly causes the evolution of z(t). The constant alpha directly causes the transformation g(z). The initial complex state z_0 directly causes the evolution of both z(t) and g(z). The time t directly causes the evolution of z(t) and g(z)."
