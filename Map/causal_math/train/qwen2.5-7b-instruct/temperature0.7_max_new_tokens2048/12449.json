  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at some time \\( T \\), can the initial condition \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(0)) \\) be accurately deduced without knowing the specifics of \\( P(D) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of the initial condition \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(0)) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) demands knowledge of the linear differential operator \\( P(D) \\), as it dictates the evolution of the frequency components of \\( z(t) \\). Without this information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the original spectral distribution.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "P(D) influences the time derivative of z(t), which in turn affects z(t); z(t) transforms into its frequency domain representation through the Fourier transform; the Fourier transform at time T indirectly depends on the Fourier transform at time 0 through the dynamics of z(t)."
