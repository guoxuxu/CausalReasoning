  "Problem": "Imagine a system involving heat transfer on a rod modelled by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\), where \\( u \\) represents the temperature, \\( t \\) is the time, and \\( x \\) the position along the rod. The transformation \\( v(x, t) = u(x, t) + h(t)e^{ax} \\) is considered, where \\( h(t) \\) is a specific heat source function and \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\( v(x, t) \\) is applied by adding \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) at t = 0 to a constant initial temperature profile \\( u_0 \\), then allowed to evolve under \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\) without further intervention, will \\( v(x, t) \\) at t = T differ from the temperature profile if \\( u_0 \\) was directly evolved under \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) alters the initial state, creating a new temperature profile that evolves differently due to the influence of both the heat conduction and the additional term \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\). The transformed state \\( v(x, t) \\) thus deviates from the mere evolution of \\( u_0 \\) under \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\).",
