  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u + ku\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We explore the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) solely from the Fourier transformed state \\\\(F(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\(F(u)\\\\) was applied at the onset or later?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether or when the Fourier transform was applied, the deduced initial conditions can vary because the Fourier transformation can either pre-exist or be part of the evolving equation, impacting the frequency components in ways that are not reversible purely based on the transformed state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
