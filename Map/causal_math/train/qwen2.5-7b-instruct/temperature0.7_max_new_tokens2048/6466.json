  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We investigate the causal effects of operations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and their expression through the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nIf we observe \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after some time T, and it shows a change, can we conclude that exactly \\\\( h(z) = z(t) + ce^{-dt} \\\\) was applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting \\\\( g(z) \\\\) being a complex integral, many different modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), such as scaling or other forms of time-decaying functions, could produce similar changes in the integral, thus an exact deduction of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is not possible.",
