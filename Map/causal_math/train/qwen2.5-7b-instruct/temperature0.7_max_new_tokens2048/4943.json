  "Problem": "Investigate the response function R(z) in a complex system, where \\\\( R(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), with complex coefficients a and b. The system's behavior is probed using a transformation \\\\( T(s) = e^{st} \\\\) where s is a complex number and t represents time.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( U(q) = q^t \\\\) where q is another complex number, is applied as an intervention at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the subsequent behavior of \\\\( R(z) \\\\) for z = U(q) depend solely on the initial response function parameters a and b?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the transformation \\\\( U(q) \\\\) adds another complex dynamic to the system, influencing the result in a way that is dependent on the properties of q and t as well as the initial parameters a and b. Hence, the behavior of R under this intervention is a function of multiple parameters above and beyond the original a and b.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
