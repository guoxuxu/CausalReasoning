  "Problem": "Assume we have a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex square matrix that represents the system's dynamics. Assume further that we can apply a transformation function \\\\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( D \\\\) another complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modifier function \\\\( g(z) = Ee^{Ft}z \\\\) (where \\\\( E \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( F \\\\) another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the system's behavior at \\\\( t = T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) but not on \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( E \\\\), or \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces yet more complex dynamics involving \\\\( E \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\) in addition to the original effects of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) from \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Thus, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) will depend on all these matrices, and not merely on \\\\( A \\\\). Furthermore, interactions between these transformations add additional complexity.",
