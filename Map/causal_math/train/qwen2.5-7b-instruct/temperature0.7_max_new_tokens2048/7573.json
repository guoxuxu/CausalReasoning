  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), with P being a constant complex number. Consider the Beta transformation defined as \\\\( h(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve naturally under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial starting point by a factor of \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), and since \\\\( Q \\\\) may alter the path, the development path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ from the path taken by simply evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the influence of P alone.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 evolves to z(t) under the differential equation dz/dt = Pz. Applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 at t=0 results in h(z_0) which, when evolved for time T under the same differential equation, reaches z(T). Therefore, the state of z(t) at t=T after evolving from z_0 directly under Pz equals the state of z(t) at t=T after applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 and then evolving it under Pz."
