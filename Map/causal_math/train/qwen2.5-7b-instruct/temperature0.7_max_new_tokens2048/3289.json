  "Problem": "Analyze the interplay of linear transformations and differential operators in a vector space. Assume we have a set of equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. Then, explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\), where R is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\) changes the initial state of the vector, which modifies the trajectory of the system. Although the subsequent evolution obeys \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), the initial application of R makes the final state at time T different due to the changed starting conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation R to z_0 yields z_1, which then evolves over time t under the dynamics defined by D to become z(t). Directly evolving z_0 under D from t=0 to t=T results in z'(t), while applying R to z_0 first and then evolving it under D also results in z'(t) at t=T."
