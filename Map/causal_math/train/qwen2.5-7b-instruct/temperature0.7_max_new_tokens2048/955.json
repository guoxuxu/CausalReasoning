  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}y(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where y(t) is the response of a circuit involving a unit step function shifted by a time delay \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\cdot y(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention before taking the Laplace transform, will the resulting \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) still reflect the characteristics of the original shifted step function without any distortions?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\cdot y(t) \\\\) before computing the Laplace transform significantly changes the response, as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{t^2y(t)\\\\} \\\\) introduces additional poles into the Laplace domain expression, significantly altering the transformation and not merely reflecting a scaled version of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The response y(t) of the circuit directly influences its Laplace transform Y(s). The transformation g(t) = t^2 * y(t) introduces an additional factor that modifies y(t) before the Laplace transform is applied, potentially distorting the characteristics of the original shifted step function."
