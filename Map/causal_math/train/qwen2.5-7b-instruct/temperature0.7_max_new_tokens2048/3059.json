  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\) as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the system continues to evolve under the diffusion PDE, will the population distribution at a later time \\\\( t_2 > t_1 \\\\) be solely determined by the initial diffusion process?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with Fourier transform alters the state of \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\), potentially adding new frequency components or redistributing existing ones. Thus, the population distribution at any later \\\\( t_2 \\\\) is a result of both the initial diffusion process and the changes introduced by the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
