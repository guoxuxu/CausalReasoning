  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-dependent signal in the complex plane where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This scenario analyzes the impact of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), applied to this function and its influence over frequency domain representation.\n\nBased on the observed Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) after an intervention, can we determine exactly whether the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) has been multiplied by another exponential signal or not?",
  "Explanation": "If the Fourier Transform of the observed signal shows a frequency that deviates from the expected \\\\( \\omega \\\\) associated with the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it indicates the multiplication by another exponential signal that effectively shifts the frequency. Thus, it's possible to determine if such an intervention occurred.",
