  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a system defined by complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. The system transformation is examined by applying the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another complex constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the system at time T, can we deduce the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) might have altered the initial conditions and, depending on the properties of N relative to M, the transformation may not be reversible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

The matrix N directly causes the transformation of z through h(z). Applying h(z) directly influences the state of z at time T (z(T))."
