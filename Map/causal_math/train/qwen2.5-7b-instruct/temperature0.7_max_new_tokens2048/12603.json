  "Problem": "Assume a system of partial differential equations governing heat flow in a rod, described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where u is the temperature and k is the diffusion constant. Explore the consequences of applying a temperature-dependent transformation \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda u} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), solely based on knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature profile at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of the transformations \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\) due to their exponential effects and the nature of heat diffusion. The overlap in potential effects from different transformations makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact interventions used solely based on the endpoint data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion constant k influences the temperature profile u(x, T) over time. The constant λ influences the transformation f(u) applied to u, resulting in transformed_u. Knowing the final temperature profile u(x, T) does not uniquely determine whether f(u), g(u), or both transformations were applied."
