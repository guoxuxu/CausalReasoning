  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor having capacitance C described by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\\\omega^2 q = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q\\\\) is the charge on the capacitor and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. Investigate the transformation of the system state when subjected to an external sinusoidal voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied such as changing the capacitance to \\\\(C'\\\\) at time t = \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) for t > \\\\(t_1\\\\) depend solely on the new capacitance value \\\\(C'\\\\) and not on the original \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) will depend on both the new capacitance \\\\(C'\\\\) and the conditions of the circuit prior to \\\\(t_1\\\\), including the original capacitance \\\\(C\\\\). Transient dynamics just after \\\\(t_1\\\\) will affect how the circuit adjusts to this new parameter, making the response dependent on both capacitances.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changing the capacitance to C' at time t = t1 will directly influence the behavior of q(t) for t > t1; the original capacitance C and the external sinusoidal voltage V(t) do not affect the behavior of q(t) after the intervention."
