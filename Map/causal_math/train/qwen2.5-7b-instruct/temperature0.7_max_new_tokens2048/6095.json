  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) under an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf an adjustment is made partway through the interval of integration, modifying \\\\( s \\\\) to a new value \\\\( s' \\\\) after a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting function after transformation still only depend on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new decay rate \\\\( s' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) contributes an additional variable influencing the resultant transform. This change not only affects the integration process but also creates a complex dependency on both the original and the modified parameters, hence the output will depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( s \\\\), and \\\\( s' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Adjusting s to s' at t_1 changes the integral transform output, impacting s' → T[z] and s → T[z] depending on the interval of integration."
