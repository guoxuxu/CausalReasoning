  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the impact of altering this system using a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T, is it possible to uniquely identify the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\), it is impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\(x_0\\\\) because the transformation could have modified the initial state and trajectory in a non-traceable manner, unless additional information about S or its effects is known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
