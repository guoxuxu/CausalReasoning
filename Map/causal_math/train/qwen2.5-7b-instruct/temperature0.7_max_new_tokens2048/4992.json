  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a Fourier Transform \\( F(k) \\) applied to a function \\( f(x) \\). We analyze various scenarios where \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\), and ‘a’ is a real constant, to understand the impact of this transformation on the system.\n\nGiven the final transform \\( F(k) \\) at \\( T \\), can we accurately ascertain what modulations were applied (whether \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both), only based on the final \\( F(k) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since both modulations \\( g(x) \\) and \\( h(x) \\) affect the frequency components of \\( F(k) \\), multiple combinations of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) could result in the same frequency shifts. Without additional information, it's impossible to disentangle which modulations were applied solely based on \\( F(k) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
