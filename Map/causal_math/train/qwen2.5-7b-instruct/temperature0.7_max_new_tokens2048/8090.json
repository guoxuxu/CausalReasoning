  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential, \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 \\\\psi + V(x) \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is the potential energy function. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\\\hbar} \\\\), where H is a Hamiltonian operator.\n\nCan we deduce the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\), the initial state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) could have been any state that, when transformed and evolved, results in the observed \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\). Multiple potential initial states could evolve to the same final state, especially without knowing the action of \\\\( U(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential energy function V(x) influences the wave function ψ, the Hamiltonian H generates the unitary operator U(t), and the initial wave function ψ0 evolves to ψ(t) under the action of U(t), but observing ψ(t) at time T does not allow us to deduce ψ0 without knowledge of U(t)."
