  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. Let's examine the system's behavior under the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and perform perturbations using multiplication by another function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive real constant.\n\nDoes applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\) and then allowing the system to evolve without further action yield a frequency spectrum centered solely at \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\), \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\xi) \\). Without further action, the spectrum remains centered at \\( \\omega \\), indicating a frequency component solely at \\( \\omega \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of ω directly influences z(t) through its role as the angular frequency in the exponential function. The presence of α directly causes the function h(t) to decay exponentially with time. Multiplying z(t) by h(t) directly results in z(t)h(t). Applying the Fourier Transform to z(t)h(t) directly yields the transformed_spectrum."
