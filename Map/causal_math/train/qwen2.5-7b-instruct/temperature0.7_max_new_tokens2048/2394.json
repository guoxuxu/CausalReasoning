  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We investigate the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\) on the function over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) exactly after observing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the specific form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a purely exponential function like \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a distinct frequency spike (delta function) at \\\\( \\omega \\). Thus, observing the Fourier transform allows us to exactly deduce that the original function was indeed \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), given the characteristic nature of this transformation.",
