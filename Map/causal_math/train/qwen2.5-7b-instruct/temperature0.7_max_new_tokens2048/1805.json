  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz + D\\\\), where C is a matrix and D is a vector constant. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Mz + N \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector, at an initial time t = 0.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz + D\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T end up differently than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was allowed to evolve directly under the differential equation for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies both the scale and the translation of the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This changed initial condition, now being \\\\( Mz_0 + N \\\\), will evolve differently under the differential equation due to the distinct starting vector, which affects the entire trajectory governed by both C and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving under the differential equation leads to a different z(t) compared to evolving z_0 directly under the differential equation for the same duration."
