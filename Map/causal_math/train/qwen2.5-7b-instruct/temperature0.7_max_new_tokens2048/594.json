  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex scalar. A transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(m\\\\) is a complex scalar.\n\nKnowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at some time \\\\(T\\\\), can we unequivocally determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) fundamentally alters the original state \\\\(z_0\\\\). Without knowing if \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied, multiple potential original states could map to the same \\\\(z(T)\\\\) due to the properties of the exponential function in the complex domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Given z(T) at time T, we cannot uniquely determine z_0 without knowing if the transformation h(z) was applied. The parameter s influences z(T), and the transformation h(z) also affects z(T), but knowing z(T) alone is insufficient to backtrack to z_0."
