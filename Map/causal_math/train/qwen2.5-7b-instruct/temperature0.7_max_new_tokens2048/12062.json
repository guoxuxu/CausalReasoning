  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) and A is a matrix. We analyze the causal effect of a matrix intervention \\\\( B \\\\) on function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+B)t} \\\\) and its corresponding transformed function over time.\n\nIf an intervention applies a new matrix C at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), so the function changes to \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+C)t} \\\\), will the resulting transform \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of the initial matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention leads to a new function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+C)t} \\\\), and the resulting transformation \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) will contain the effects of C along with the initial matrix A. The transformation's result at any time T > t_1 is influenced by both A and C, and potentially B if it affects conditions preceding t_1.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
