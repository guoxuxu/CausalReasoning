  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. We introduce a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that takes the form \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a finite time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) initially at t = 0 and then evolved over time up to \\\\( T \\\\), will \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\) be identical to applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly on \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) up to \\\\( T \\\\) without first evaluating \\\\( L(z)(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) when applied initially or at any subsequent time up to \\\\( T \\\\) essentially computes the same integral over the interval from 0 to \\\\( T \\\\). This is because \\\\( L \\\\) acts linearly and time-invariantly across the entire range specified, thus yielding the same result regardless of when it's computed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at time T is influenced by the parameters w, s, and T through the linear operator L. Evaluating L(z) at t=0 before evolving z(t) over time does not affect the final value L(z)(T) because the integral from 0 to T captures the entire behavior of z(t) over the interval."
