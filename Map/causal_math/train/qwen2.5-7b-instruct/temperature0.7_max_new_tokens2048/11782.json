  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Rt} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention via another function \\\\( g(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{St} \\\\) (where \\\\( S \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( R \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional variable that modifies the state parallel to the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), reflecting changes induced at different instances through \\\\( T \\\\) in addition to the inherent evolution under \\\\( P \\\\).",
