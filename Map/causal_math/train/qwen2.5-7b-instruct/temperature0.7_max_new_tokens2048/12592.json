  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and let an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. The study involves analyzing how transformations affect the function and its integration outcomes.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) without any modifications to \\\\( s \\\\), will the transformed function reflect solely the properties of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) over the integration bounds?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( T(g) \\\\) applied directly to \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) is indeed an expression of its properties without modification, accounting for the effects of the exponential function over the entire range of integration given by the defined limits.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
