  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega \\\\tau} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real-valued continuous function of time, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We seek to determine the implications of introducing a perturbation by the function \\\\( f(x) = x + c\\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve normally, will the transformed integral \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T still represent the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\)'s Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The perturbation introduced by \\\\( f(x) = x + c \\\\) adds a constant term to \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in an additional term \\\\( c \\\\int e^{i\\\\omega \\\\tau} d\\\\tau \\\\) in the integral. This addition modifies the result, thus altering the integral's correspondence to the original Fourier transformation of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
