  "Problem": "Assess the interplay between a time-varying voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) applied across a linear system with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\. The output voltage across the system is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (v * h)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf at certain time \\\\( t' \\\\), an additional voltage \\\\( v'(t) = U_0 e^{i \\\\phi t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t' \\\\) remain a simple superposition of the original and the new voltage responses?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system's response to individual inputs is linear, applying an additional voltage \\\\( v'(t) \\\\) results in an additive combination of responses linearly. Thus, \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) is essentially a simple superposition of the separate responses to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v'(t) \\\\)",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input voltage v(t) and the additional voltage v'(t) each independently cause the output voltage y(t) and y'(t) respectively, and their combined effect results in a superposition of their individual outputs y(t) + y'(t)."
