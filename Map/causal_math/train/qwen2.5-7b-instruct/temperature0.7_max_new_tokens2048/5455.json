  "Problem": "In the context of a quantum mechanics framework, the time evolution of a quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, where the Hamiltonian operator \\\\( H \\\\) may involve time-dependent terms. We study the effect of applying an initial quantum gate transformation, represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U \\\\), on the state \\\\( \\\\psi(0) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by another unitary operation \\\\( V(t) \\\\), time-dependent, is applied at a selected time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) depend solely on the properties of the Hamiltonian \\\\( H \\\\) and not on the initial operation \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) is influenced by all transformations along its evolution, including both the initial operation \\\\( U \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( V(t) \\\\). These transformations interact with the evolving Hamiltonian, making the final state a result of a complex interaction between \\\\( U \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), and \\\\( H \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An initial unitary operation U transforms the initial state ψ(0), and a time-dependent unitary operation V(t) further transforms the state ψ(t) at time t1. The Hamiltonian H governs the time evolution of the state from ψ(t) to ψ(T). Therefore, the final state ψ(T) depends on both U, through ψ(0), and V(t) and H, through ψ(t)."
