  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subjected to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant complex number. Analyze how the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\) affects z over time t, where \\\\( U \\\\) is also a constant complex number.\n\nCan we infer the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( e^{Ut} \\\\) potentially modifies z_0, without knowledge of its application, it\\'s not possible to accurately trace back to z_0 because \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could represent multiple potential origins due to the effect of \\\\( U \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation f(z) = e^(Ut)z directly causes z(t) to evolve over time t, with the initial complex number z(0) determining z(t). The constant D in the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\) directly causes z'(t)."
