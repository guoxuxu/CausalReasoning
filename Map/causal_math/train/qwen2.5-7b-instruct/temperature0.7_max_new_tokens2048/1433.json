  "Problem": "Assume a system of linear equations modeled by the matrix equation \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a constant vector. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the equation system \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T depend on the initial application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state by integrating over a function of time, thus changing the trajectory in the system governed by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). This transformation affects the evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) under the linear system, leading to a state at time T that is dependent on both the transformation and the original system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
