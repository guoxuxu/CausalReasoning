  "Problem": "Assume a linear system of equations represented in matrix form \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is an invertible matrix. Analyze scenarios applying the Laplace transform to the function \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), with \\\\( x_0 \\\\) being the initial conditions, over the time domain.\n\nIf an intervention occurs by modifying the equation to \\\\( Ax = b + c \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant vector introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Laplace transform of the system's state at T > t_1 be solely influenced by \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\), and not by \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( c \\\\) as an intervention modifies the system equation, thereby altering the solution and its corresponding Laplace transform. Since \\\\( c \\\\) directly affects the homogeneity and particular solution of the system, its impact will be reflected in the transformed state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
