  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector. The system is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt'}N dt' \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively trace back and ascertain the exact transformations used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the state at T?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different combinations or sequences of the transformations due to the additive effects and the nature of integral transformations. These effects yield overlapping possible trajectories, making it impossible to uniquely determine the specific transformations or sequence of events that led to \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
