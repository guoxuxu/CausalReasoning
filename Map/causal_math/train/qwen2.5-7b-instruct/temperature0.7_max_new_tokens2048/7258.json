  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = T, is it possible to determine if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and lack of further information on how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved over time, we cannot uniquely determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied originally — especially since both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) contribute complex rotations that could result in similar outcomes at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) at t=0 leads to changes in z(T). The rate of change of z with respect to time (ω) determines how z evolves, and the phase shift parameter (α) affects the initial value of z through the transformation."
