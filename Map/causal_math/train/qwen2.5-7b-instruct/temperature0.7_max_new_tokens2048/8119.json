  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing the motion of a particle in a plane, influenced by the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf an intervention altering the phase by multiplying by \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still be predictable solely based on the initial dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new phase factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) alters the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting the subsequent evolution. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the initial dynamics and the nature of the intervention, so it's not solely predictable from the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial position (x(t) and y(t)) and the complex transformation (e^(iωt)z) determine z(t). An intervention at t_1 (multiplying by e^(iθ)) changes z(t_1), which then influences z(T) through the continuous application of the transformation e^(iωt). Therefore, z(T) can still be predicted based on the initial dynamics and the intervention."
