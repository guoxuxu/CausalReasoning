  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature (T) at any spatial point (x,y) in a region follows the heat equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We study the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the temperature distribution, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), and analyze its influence over time.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution T at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution at t = T follow the same evolution as an untransformed initial T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\) alters the initial condition in the frequency domain. Since the heat equation and its solutions depend heavily on the initial conditions, the transformation changes how the system evolves, resulting specifically in different frequency components dominating the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution T(t=0) directly causes the temperature distribution T(t=T) after time T under the heat equation. Applying the Fourier transform mathcal{F}(T) to the initial temperature distribution does not change this causal relationship, meaning the transformed initial condition still evolves according to the heat equation to produce the same temperature distribution T(t=T) at time T."
