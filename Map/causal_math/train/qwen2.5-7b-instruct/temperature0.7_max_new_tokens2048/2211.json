  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\) where c is a real number is applied at some time after \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\( g(f(z)) \\\\) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the resulting value by adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\), shifting the phase of the complex exponential. This change makes the final outcome dependent on both the original function and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) = z + c modifies the output of f(z) = e^(iz) by adding a constant c, thus the final outcome of g(f(z)) depends on both the transformation f and the intervention c."
