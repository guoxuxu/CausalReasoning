  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a complex domain, \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), for a function \\\\( u: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\). We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\), evaluated at complex number z, and how its impact is observed over space without and with additional transformations.\n\nAfter observing the transformed and evolved state \\\\( u(z) \\\\) at a point in the complex domain, can we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial use of the Fourier transform, predicting the original function is infeasible because the Fourier operation might have significantly modified the initial condition's frequency spectrum, which directly influences the solution under Laplace's equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
