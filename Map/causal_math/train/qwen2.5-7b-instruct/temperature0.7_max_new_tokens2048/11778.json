  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time linear system controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Consider the application of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nx} \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, and study its effects over time.\n\nIf an intervention via a function \\\\( k(x) = e^{Qx}x \\\\) (where Q is a constant matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend solely on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(x) \\\\) adds an additional layer of complexity. The state trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward will depend on the effects of M, N, and now Q, especially how these matrices influence the system dynamics through their respective transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
