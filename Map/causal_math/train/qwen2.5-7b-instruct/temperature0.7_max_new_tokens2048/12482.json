  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further alters the trajectory of the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the interplay between \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and the solution to the differential equation driven by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Each parameter contributes to the scaling and rotation in the complex plane, affecting the endpoint.",
