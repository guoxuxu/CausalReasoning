  "Problem": "We have a LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) system characterized by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Lx(t) = y(t) \\\\). In addition, we consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse transformation applied to \\\\( X(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( y(t) = L(h(t) * x(t)) \\\\) after the convolution intervention, can we determine exactly what the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was, merely from the outputs and knowing the Laplace transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) intertwines its properties with those of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), complicating the extraction of the exact original function just from the system outputs. Even knowing the Laplace transformations were utilised, multiple candidate functions for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) might result in the same output.",
