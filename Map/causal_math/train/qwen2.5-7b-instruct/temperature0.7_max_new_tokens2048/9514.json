  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant, is applied.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was applied during the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( F \\\\) modifies the trajectory in a way that integrates the changes without preserving pointwise information about the initial function state \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\). Consequently, reconstructing the exact initial function just from the integral transformation result at T without knowing the specifics of \\\\( F \\\\)'s application (like B) is unfeasible.",
