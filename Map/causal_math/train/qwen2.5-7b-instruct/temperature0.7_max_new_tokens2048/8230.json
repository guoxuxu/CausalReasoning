  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t)dt \\\\. Analyze the causal impact on the transformed function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) given an intervention \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) with an additional function \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) accurately up to time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by observing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at some point s without knowing if any transformation like \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), it is unclear if the observed \\\\( H(s) \\\\) results solely from \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) or if it has been affected by \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\). This uncertainty prevents precise determination of the original function up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
