  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) x(t) \\\\). The signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nUpon observing the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both) were applied throughout the evolution, based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) could result from a variety of transformation combinations and timings. Without detailed historical information on when and which transformations were applied, the signal's path cannot be uniquely retraced to identify the specific interventions. The transformations' effects might overlap and interfere, obscuring their individual impact.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
