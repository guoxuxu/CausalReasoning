  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, which follows the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied over a time period \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after evolving under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) naturally to T, can we determine the specific impact or contribution of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) had it been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Only knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after natural evolution does not provide sufficient information to infer back the effects if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, due to the irreversible and non-unique integration process in \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
