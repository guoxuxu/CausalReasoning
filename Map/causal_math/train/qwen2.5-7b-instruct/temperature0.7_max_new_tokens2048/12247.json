  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving in time under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) are real constants reflecting oscillatory and exponential behaviors, respectively.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (initial, and at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)), using only the data of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from multiple exponential transformations affecting both magnitude and phase, making it difficult to distinguish between the compounded effects of the initial transformation and the intervention without additional information about the time or nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0, the angular frequency ω, the growth rate λ, and the time t each directly cause the final value z(T)."
