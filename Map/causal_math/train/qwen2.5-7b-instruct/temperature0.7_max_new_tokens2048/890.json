  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables. We study the function transformation by the integral kernel \\\\( K(s, t) = e^{-st} \\\\) under operation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(s,t) f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed function at time T, can we accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(t) = t + it^2 \\\\) without the original function form?",
  "Explanation": "The irreversible nature of the integration under the exponential kernel means information about the exact power of t in the original function could be lost, and multiple original functions could yield similar transformed outputs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
