  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) applied to a time-dependent differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u = g(t) \\\\). We investigate the effect of an external transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(t) = te^{kt} \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is set as \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in the differential equation at t = 0 and evolved according to the equation until t = T, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same compared to if the system evolves with \\\\( g(t) = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( h(t) \\\\) transforms the driving function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), it changes the input to the differential equation, thus altering the system's response. Therefore, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) when driven by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) would not be the same as when driven by \\\\( g(t) = 0 \\\\), due to the specific influence of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) on the system dynamics.",
