  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions related to the real and imaginary parts of a complex function subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the initial conditions of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) are doubled at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve without any intervention, will the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for the modified system at s = a (where a is a constant) be twice that of the original system's transform at the same point?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the initial conditions of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) directly scales the entire function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by 2. Given the linearity of the Laplace transform, this results in \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) also being scaled by a factor of 2 for any s, including s = a.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial conditions x(0) and y(0) directly cause the Laplace transform Z(s) of the function z(t). Doubling x(0) and y(0) at t=0 will double the transform Z(s) at s=a."
