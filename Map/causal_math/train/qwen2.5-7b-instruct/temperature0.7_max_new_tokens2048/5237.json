  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x + e^{iBt}y \\\\) where x and y are constant vectors and A, B are constant matrices. The function describes the evolution of a vector in a complex plane subjected to two rotational effects.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( z(0) = x + y \\\\) evolves under the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz + iBy \\\\) without any intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if the system followed a different rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iA'z + iB'y \\\\) with A' and B' being different from A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is uniquely determined by the matrices A and B. Changing A and B to A' and B', alters the frequencies and phases of the rotations, leading to a different trajectory and hence a different state at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
