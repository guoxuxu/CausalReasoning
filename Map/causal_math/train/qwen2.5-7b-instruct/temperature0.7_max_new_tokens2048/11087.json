  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effects of applying Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as well as its inverse and interactions due to various potential modifications.\n\nIf after performing the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(z) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\), an additional filtering operation represented by multiplication with a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) in the s-domain is applied, will the final inverse-transformed function reflect only the original \\\\( g(z) \\\\) characteristics?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an extra filtering operation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifies the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by convolution in the time-domain upon taking the inverse Laplace Transform. The final function would represent a blend or modified version of the original function, influenced by both \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the filter's characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace transform to g(z) results in F(s), multiplying F(s) by H(s) modifies it to F(s)H(s), and the inverse transform of F(s)H(s) yields G_final(z) which incorporates the effect of H(s)."
