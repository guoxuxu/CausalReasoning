  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( u(z) \\\\) represents a potential field. We're exploring the effect of a linear transformation on this field, specifically through the function \\\\( T(w) = (Aw + b) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( w \\\\) is the transformed variable.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( u(T(w)) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( w \\\\), can the original value of \\\\( w \\\\) be conclusively determined without knowing whether a transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the linear transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, and not knowing the specific parameters of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it is not possible to unique map back to the original variable \\\\( w \\\\). The transformation could have altered \\\\( w \\\\) in ways that are not recoverable simply by observing the output of the potential field.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
