  "Problem": "Let us consider a complex function initially defined on the real axis: \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are real functions representing components in the complex plane. A transformation \\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\), where A is a complex constant and t is time, is applied.\n\nGiven \\( z(T) \\) at time T, can we deduce the original function at \\( z_0 \\) knowing only that the transformation \\( f(z) \\) could have been applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( f(z) \\) could involve a complex exponential function that changes both magnitude and phase of \\( z_0 \\), without specific knowledge of A, retrieving \\( z_0 \\) from \\( z(T) \\) accurately is not possible, as multiple original conditions could lead to the same \\( z(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex function z(t) is determined by its real components x(t) and y(t). The transformation f(z) depends on the constant A and time t. Applying the transformation at t=0 leads to z(T), allowing us to trace back to the initial function z_0."
