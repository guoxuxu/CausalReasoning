  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex number representing an initial value in the complex plane. This scenario deals with the evolution of the complex function over time and explores the possible effects of external complex transformations.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{i \\theta t} \\\\) was applied at some point, only based on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional data about time intervals or \\\\( \\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different paths involving varying applications or non-applications of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or different values of \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and intervals. Without explicit knowledge of these factors, it's impossible to confirm the specific intervention based solely on \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0, the angular frequency ω, and the imaginary unit i directly cause the final state z(T). The time T also influences z(T)."
