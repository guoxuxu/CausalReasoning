  "Problem": "Consider the fluid dynamics described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Let \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid, where \\\\( x \\\\) is the position and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We investigate the behavior of the fluid under a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\vec{u}) = \\\\nabla \\\\times (\\\\vec{u}) \\\\), which represents the curl of the velocity field.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(\\\\vec{u}) \\\\), \\\\( g(\\\\vec{u}) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(T) \\\\) may result from different types and combinations of interventions due to the possible overlapping effects in the transformations. Particularly, both curl and divergence operations affect the fluid dynamics in ways that may not be distinguishable at time T without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
