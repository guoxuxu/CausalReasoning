  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). The impact of a Fourier transform on the wave function is studied to see how it affects the system's evolution.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi)(k, t = 0)\\\\) is applied to the wave function at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = 0)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the Schrödinger equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = 0)\\\\) and evolving it in the momentum space does not change the physical content of the wave function. Since Fourier transform is invertible and due to the linearity and unitarity of the Schrödinger equation, the evolved wave function in position space at time T will be equivalent to that obtained from direct evolution of the initial wave function in position space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential V(x) influences the wave function ψ(x, t) through the Schrödinger equation. The initial wave function ψ(x, t=0) evolves to ψ(x, t) over time under the Schrödinger equation. Applying the Fourier transform to ψ(x, t=0) results in F(ψ)(k, t=0), which can then be inverse transformed back to ψ(x, t) at any time t."
