  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the original function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transformation into the complex s-plane. We study the effects of a convolution operation with a kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented by its transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is convoluted with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to produce \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\), then transformed without further modification, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at a later time t be the same as the product of the initial transforms, i.e., \\\\( F(s)G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual transforms. Therefore, the transform of \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) will be \\\\( F(s)G(s) \\\\), consistent over time if there are no further modifications.",
