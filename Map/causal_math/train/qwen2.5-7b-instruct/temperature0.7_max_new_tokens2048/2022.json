  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed using \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to analyze its behavior over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the scaling effect on the amplitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) introduced by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) remains unknown. This uncertainty prevents uniquely determining the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) based solely on the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T.",
