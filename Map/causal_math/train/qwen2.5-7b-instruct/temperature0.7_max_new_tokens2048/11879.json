  "Problem": "Let's consider a scenario involving an electrical network with a linear resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit. The circuit's voltage response \\( v(t) \\) across the capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{1}{RC}v = \\frac{1}{RC}v_{\\text{in}} \\), where \\( v_{\\text{in}} \\) is the input voltage source and R and C are the resistance and capacitance, respectively. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\} \\) to convert the system into the s-domain making analysis potentially different.\n\nGiven the output \\( v(T) \\), can we determine what interventions were made (whether and when \\( R_2 \\) was introduced) only by knowing the final state \\( v(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "While knowing \\( v(T) \\) provides insights on the system state at time T, it doesn't necessarily reveal the history of interventions like the addition of \\( R_2 \\). Multiple scenarios could lead to similar \\( v(T) \\), especially if interventions were temporary or partially reversible. Path dependency and possible multiple solutions obscure direct inference of historical actions from final states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "v(t) → v(T); R → 1/RC; C → 1/RC; v_{in} → dv/dt; R2 → (intervention)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage response v(t) across the capacitor at time T (v(T)) is influenced by the resistance R and capacitance C through their reciprocal product 1/RC, the input voltage v_in affecting the rate of change of v(t) (dv/dt), and the introduction of R2 as an intervention."
