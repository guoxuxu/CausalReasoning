  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a closed container, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity constant. We investigate the effect of a spatial transformation \\\\( u' = T(u) \\\\) where \\\\( T \\\\) is a rotation matrix.\n\nGiven the velocity field \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we determine precisely what transformations (\\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) were used, solely by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) can result from various sequences of transformations due to the rotational properties of the matrices and the underlying dynamics of the fluid equations. This overlap in potential trajectories and the effects of non-linear terms make it impossible to uniquely identify whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both were applied.",
