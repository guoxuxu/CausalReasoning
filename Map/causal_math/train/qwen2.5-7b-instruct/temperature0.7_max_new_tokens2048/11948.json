  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency, representing the circuit's impedance. An integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to analyze the circuit's behavior in response to various input signals represented as functions of \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf an input signal \\\\( X(s) \\\\) characterized by a certain Laplace Transform is applied to the circuit, and the circuit is allowed to respond naturally without additional modifications, will the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) be solely determined by the original characteristics of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in a linear circuit described by Laplace Transforms is the product of the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and the system's impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). In absence of any intervention, \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is directly determined by these characteristics through the relation \\\\( Y(s) = Z(s) X(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
