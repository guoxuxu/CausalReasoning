  "Problem": "Imagine an electrical RLC circuit with a voltage source described by a sinusoidal function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the amplitude, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The response of the circuit is analytically described by the Laplace transform of the voltage across different circuit elements.\n\nIf the input voltage function \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is varied by changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), without any changes to circuit parameters, will the Laplace transform of the steady-state current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) through the inductor change?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) affects the sinusoidal frequency of the input voltage, which directly influences the Laplace transform of the current through the dynamic impedance offered by the inductor, specifically altering the terms involving \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the transform equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
