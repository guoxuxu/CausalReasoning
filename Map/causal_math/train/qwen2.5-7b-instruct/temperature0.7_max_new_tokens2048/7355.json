  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-dependent system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. An integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) is applied at some time t = t_1, will the final transformed function \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original PDE without considering the effect of G?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transformation \\\\( G(u) \\\\) modifies the state of the system by potentially altering the terms of the solution. The inverse Fourier components introduced by \\\\( G \\\\) will affect the evolution such that the final state at T cannot be described solely by the initial PDE variables and \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
