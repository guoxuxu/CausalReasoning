  "Problem": "Imagine a system where the temperature distribution on a plate is modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), and as an experiment, a function \\\\( h(u) = e^{-kt}u \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant) is applied at different times to alter the temperature pattern.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(u) \\\\), the initial conditions could have been any distribution consistent with the observed steady-state, affected uniquely by the scaling factor \\\\( e^{-kt} \\\\). Hence, there is insufficient information to reconstruct the original distribution precisely.",
