  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of the system is analyzed when a transformation through a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) represented by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Lz \\\\) is introduced.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( M \\\\) (also represented as a matrix acting on \\\\( z \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) and not affected by \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) as an intervention adds another layer of complexity. The state at endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) not only evolves under the influence of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) but is also significantly influenced by the transformations \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), each potentially altering both magnitude and direction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) for T > t_1 is determined by the original function z(t) = e^(at) and the interventions L and M, with t_1 influencing the timing of M."
