  "Problem": "Evaluate the system of differential equations characterized by the Laplace transform of functions and their inverse. Let \\\\( X(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of a function x(t), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) the transfer function of a linear system. The response of the system is given by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the system is observed to be zero, can we definitively conclude that the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was zero without knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "A zero output \\\\( y(t) = 0 \\\\) does not necessarily imply a zero input \\\\( x(t) = 0 \\\\) unless we know that \\\\( H(s) \\\\) does not include any zeros in its transfer function. Thus, without information about \\\\( H(s) \\\\), we cannot conclusively determine the nature of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) based on output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the input function X(s) directly causes the Laplace transform of the output Y(s), and the transfer function H(s) also directly causes Y(s). If Y(s) is zero, it implies that either X(s) is zero or H(s) is such that it nullifies the effect of X(s)."
