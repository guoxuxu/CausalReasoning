  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. This function models the summative effects of two evolving systems on a complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the vector \\\\( y \\\\) is modified at t = 0 to a new vector \\\\( y' \\\\), then allowed to evolve based on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be solely dependent on the change in \\\\( y \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the modification to \\\\( y \\\\) influences the \\\\( e^{Bt}y \\\\) term in \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the component \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\) also significantly contributes to \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( x \\\\) and the modified \\\\( y' \\\\), not just on the change in \\\\( y \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
