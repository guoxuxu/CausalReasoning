  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z}\\\\) and its effect through a contour integral \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\), where C is a closed contour path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of modifying the path C to another path C' and the use of another complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nIf the contour C is altered to a different contour C' enclosing the same poles with the same orientation, and we compute \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{C'} g(w) dw \\\\) under the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of the integral \\\\( f(z) \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "By Cauchy's integral theorem, since \\\\( g(z) = e^z \\\\) is analytic everywhere in the complex plane except at infinity and if C and C' enclose the same poles with the same orientation without crossing any branch cuts (non-existent for \\\\( e^z \\\\)), the value of the integrals along C and C' will be the same.",
