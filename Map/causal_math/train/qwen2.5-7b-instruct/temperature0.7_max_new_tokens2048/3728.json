  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a functional relationship between input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The equation governing the system is \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nAfter observing the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at a particular s = S, can we determine precisely which operations or scaling were applied to \\\\( V(s) \\\\), solely based on the outcome \\\\( I(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of linear systems and potential overlaps in the effects of different operations (like scaling or network operations), the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) can result from various combinations of interventions on \\\\( V(s) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of these interventions, it's impossible to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied based on the output alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input voltage V(s) directly influences the output current I(s), and the transfer function H(s) scales this influence. Given I(s) at a specific s = S, we can infer the effect of H(s) on V(s), but cannot precisely determine the exact operations or scaling applied to V(s) without additional information."
