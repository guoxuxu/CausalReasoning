  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. The system is subject to manipulation by a transformation \\\\(h(u) = u + e^{Kt}\\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) after observing \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing if \\\\(h(u)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the initial application of \\\\(h(u)\\\\), retracing to \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) becomes ambiguous since \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\) may have altered the initial state in a way that is not recoverable merely through observing the system's state at a later time \\\\(t = T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
