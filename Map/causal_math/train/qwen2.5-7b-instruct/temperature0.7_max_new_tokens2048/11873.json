  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) dt \\\\). The behavior of the function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is analyzed under different settings, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\), can we uniquely determine that the original function was \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\) is uniquely determined by the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\). Hence, observing this result allows us to infer that the input function must have been \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\).",
