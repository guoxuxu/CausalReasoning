  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the effects of differentiating this function and the application of an operation \\\\( T(z) = z' \\\\), where \\\\( z' \\\\) denotes the derivative of z.\n\nGiven \\\\( u(x) = z'(x+1) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied to \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) (i.e., the argument shift by 1) to get \\\\( u(x) \\\\), just by knowing \\\\( u(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While it is clear that an intervention has modified \\\\( z'(x) \\\\), it's not possible to unambiguously ascertain the exact nature of the transformation just from examining \\\\( u(x) \\\\). Without specific knowledge about the intervention (shift by 1), other transformations producing similar adjustments in the output could be equally plausible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z evaluated at x+1 transforms z'(x) into u(x), indicating a horizontal shift transformation."
