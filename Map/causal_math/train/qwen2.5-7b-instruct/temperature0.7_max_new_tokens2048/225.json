  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) in a complex domain where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are complex variables. Analyze how linear transformations \\\\(T(x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)\\\\) (where \\\\(a, b, c, d\\\\) are constants) affect the function.\n\nIf the initial conditions are \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve naturally under the function \\\\(f\\\\) without further intervention, will the result at a given later instance be the same as directly applying \\\\(f\\\\) on the transformed coordinates \\\\(T(x_0, y_0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome will differ as the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) changes the coordinates non-trivially (unless \\\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2 = 1\\\\) and \\\\(ac + bd = 0\\\\), which preserves the norm in the complex plane), hence altering the result of function \\\\(f\\\\) applied to these coordinates.",
