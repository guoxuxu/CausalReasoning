  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( z(t) \\) is a complex function and \\( s \\) is a complex parameter. Analyze the Laplace transform's effect on \\( z(t) \\) modified at \\( t = 0 \\) by \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) and impacted by \\( h(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\( f(z) \\) at a specific \\( s \\), can we infer whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) based on \\( z(t) \\)'s initial squared condition?",
  "Explanation": "The integration process in the Laplace Transform masks specific details about initial conditions due to its global nature over all \\( t \\). Without additional information, the resulting transform \\( f(z) \\) does not unambiguously indicate whether \\( g(z) \\) (squaring) was applied initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
