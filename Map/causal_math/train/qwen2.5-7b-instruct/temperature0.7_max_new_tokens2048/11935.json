  "Problem": "A two-dimensional linear system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) represents a rotation. We examine the effect of the function \\\\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t, where \\\\( B = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), which also results in a rotational transformation.\n\nBy only observing the state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine what interventions were implemented (whether \\\\( f(y) \\\\), \\\\( g(y) \\\\), or both) throughout the process?",
  "Explanation": "Given that different matrices have distinct effects (rotational vs. shearing), and considering the linear superposition and potential symmetries in linear transformations, different combinations of A, B, and C could theoretically result in the same endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\). Thus, the exact interventions (whether rotations by B, shearing by C, or both) cannot be uniquely determined just from the final state.",
