  "Problem": "Consider a partially observable system where the state at time t, denoted by \\\\( x(t) \\\\), evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx(t) = Cx(t) dt + dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the noise in the system. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the specific sequence and type of interventions (\\\\( h(x) \\\\) or \\\\( m(x) \\\\), or both) be uniquely determined by observing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) may result from multiple potential sequences of transformations due to the overlapping effects of matrices \\\\( D, E \\\\) and system dynamics \\\\( C \\\\), as well as the intrinsic noise. This overlap makes it impossible to accurately distinguish which interventions were precisely used, especially without additional information or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state at time t (x(t)) directly influences the state at time T (x(T)); the linear transformation h(x) directly influences the state at time T (x(T)); no information about m(x) is provided, so its relationship with x(T) cannot be determined from the given causal links."
