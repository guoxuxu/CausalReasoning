  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the state of a system \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), with \\( A \\) being a complex matrix. We inquire about the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) which modifies the system's frequency components.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system is then evolved according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further modifications, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T match the evolution of the untransformed state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at T under the same dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform alters the spectral composition of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), resulting in a modification of the initial conditions. Thus, the trajectory and final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) of the system will be different from those of an untransformed state due to changes in the frequency-domain characteristics imposed by \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F(z_0) results in a modified initial state z_0', which when evolved according to e^(At) yields z(T). The untransformed initial state z_0, when evolved using the same dynamics, also yields z(T). Therefore, whether the state z(T) matches the evolution of the untransformed state z_0 at time T under the same dynamics depends on the relationship between z_0 and z_0'."
