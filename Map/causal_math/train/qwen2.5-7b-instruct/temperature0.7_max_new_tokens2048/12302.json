  "Problem": "In a control system analysis, the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) acts on a state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. We explore the changes in state space when applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) at different points in time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be conditionally influenced only by D and not by C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation influencing the trajectory of the system. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by both the earlier application of \\\\( e^{tC} \\\\) and the scaling impact of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), rendering the endpoint dependent on both C and D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
