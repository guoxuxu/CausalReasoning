  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p \\\\dot{x} + qx = 0 \\\\), where p and q are constants. We introduce a Fourier transform of the displacement function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nIf, during observation, an additional damping term represented by function \\\\( d(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant) is introduced to the system, will the Fourier transform section corresponding to the new system represent only the effects of the original parameters p and q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the damping term \\\\( d(t) \\\\) alters the system's dynamics significantly by adding an exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\). Accordingly, the frequency spectrum obtained from the Fourier transform will reflect the influences of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) along with p and q, confusing the isolated effects of each parameter due to their interaction in the frequency domain.",
