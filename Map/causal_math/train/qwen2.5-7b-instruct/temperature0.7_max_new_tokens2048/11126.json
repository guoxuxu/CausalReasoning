  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), and given the effect of C on the initial condition, it becomes impossible to accurately trace back to \\( z_0 \\) solely based on the observed state at t = T, especially if A and C do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Given z(t) at t = T, z_0 directly influences z(t) through the differential equation. A directly causes changes in z(t). t advances time, affecting z(t). C and t jointly cause g(z). Without knowledge of g(z), deducing z_0 from z(T) is challenging."
