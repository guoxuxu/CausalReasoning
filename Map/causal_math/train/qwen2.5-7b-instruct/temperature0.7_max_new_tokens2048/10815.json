  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source influences the system described by \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) being added to certain regions at specific times.\n\nIf a specific heat source profile \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and then removed at \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the temperature distribution at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_2 \\\\)) be independent of the heat source profile?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction and subsequent removal of a heat source alters the temperature distribution transiently, and these changes persist even after the source is removed. The final temperature distribution at time \\\\( T \\\\) retains memory of this intervention, thus not being solely dictated by the initial conditions or natural diffusion.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The heat source profile h(x, t) directly influences the temperature distribution u(x, t) at any given time. The introduction of h(x, t) at t_1 and its removal at t_2 affects u(x, t) up to t_2, but after t_2, u(x, T) depends only on the initial conditions and the heat diffusion process, not on the specific h(x, t) profile."
