  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = z e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The exponential modification introduced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) affects both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), complicating backward deduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) causally influences the initial condition z_0. The constants A and B, through their effect on dz/dt, determine the dynamics of z. The constant ω also affects dz/dt. The constant C determines the transformation f(z)."
