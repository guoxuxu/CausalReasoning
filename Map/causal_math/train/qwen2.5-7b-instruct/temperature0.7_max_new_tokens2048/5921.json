  "Problem": "Analyze the causal relationship in a model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing periodic motion in the complex plane, modifies a dynamical system described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a diagonalizable matrix. Consider the effects of transforming the state by applying the function \\\\( h(z, x) = z(t) \\\\cdot x \\\\) at an initial time 't'.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z, x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) naturally without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) up to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z, x) \\\\) incorporates a complex multiplication which modifies the initial conditions by adding a rotation in the complex plane dependent on the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This initial phase shift affects the system's trajectory, making it different from the straightforward evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
