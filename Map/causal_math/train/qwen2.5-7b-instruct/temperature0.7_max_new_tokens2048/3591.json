  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over a period \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nIf a function manipulation, such as \\\\(z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta) t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) is a small perturbation, is applied midway through the interval, will the result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) still be zero?",
  "Explanation": "An additional frequency component introduced by \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) will alter the integral computation. The change in frequency, even if small, affects the orthogonality condition required for the integral to result in zero, leading to a nonzero value usually dependent on the relationship between \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\), \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), and the integration limits.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A small perturbation δ in the frequency ω causes T(z) to no longer be zero, while the original frequency ω and the integration period T determine whether T(z) is initially zero."
