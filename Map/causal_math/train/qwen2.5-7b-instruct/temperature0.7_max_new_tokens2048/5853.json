  "Problem": "A continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the complex plane follows the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. Let us consider the influence of a transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nWhen the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) for a time T without further intervention, will the \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was just evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by scaling it, and since the scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) grows or decays exponentially with time, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is modified by this exponential factor, distinct from mere rotation under \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0 evolves over time t under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) to become z(T). The transformation parameter α affects the form of the transformation function h(z), but does not change the evolution of z under the given differential equation. Therefore, applying the transformation h(z) before evolving z under the differential equation results in the same z(T) as directly evolving z_0 under the differential equation."
