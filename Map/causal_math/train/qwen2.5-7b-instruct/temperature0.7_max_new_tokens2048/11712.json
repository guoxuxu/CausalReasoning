  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions describing a signal. The signal undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nKnowing the modified transform \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\), can we determine the exact nature of temporal interventions (specifically whether a damping function was applied, and what was the value of \\\\(a\\\\)) only from \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modified transform \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\) will often resemble the convolution with an exponential decay, but distinguishing whether this specific function or another similar transformation was applied, and determining \\\\(a\\\\) precisely from \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\) alone, is generally not feasible due to potential overlaps in effects from different possible interventions.",
