  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)](k) \\\\) on the function u(x, t).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the Fourier transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or type of interventions from the final transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) is generally impossible without additional information. This uncertainty arises due to possible alterations and interactions between the Fourier transformation and the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) which are not uniquely reversible just by observing the endpoint in the transformed domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, t) is transformed by the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) into \\( \\hat{u}(k, t) \\), which at time T becomes \\( \\hat{u}(k, T) \\). The value of \\( \\hat{u}(k, T) \\) indicates the result of the transformation and can be used to infer the interventions applied."
