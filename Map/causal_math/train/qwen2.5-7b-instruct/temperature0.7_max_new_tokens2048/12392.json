  "Problem": "Assume a system governs the motion of a particle along a path on the complex plane, given by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial position and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant complex frequency. We consider transformations of the path using a mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling parameter.\n\nIf we initialize the system with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then let it evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without any further manipulations, will the trajectory of the particle at time t = T be the same as if the system was started at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolved to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) initially modifies the path by scaling the amplitude, introducing a dependency on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). As a result, the trajectory of the particle not only rotates but also scales differently due to the exponentiation with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), altering the final position at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
