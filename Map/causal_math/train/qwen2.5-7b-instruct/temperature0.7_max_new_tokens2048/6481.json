  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the impact of altering this system using a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\(x_0\\\\) directly under \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\) alters the initial state to \\\\(Sx_0\\\\). The evolved state at t = T will be \\\\(e^{Dt}(Sx_0)\\\\), which generally differs from \\\\(e^{Dt}x_0\\\\) unless \\\\(S\\\\) commutes with \\\\(e^{Dt}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(x) to x_0 and then evolving under x(t) = e^(Dt)x_0 from t=0 to t=T results in the same state as directly evolving x_0 under x(t) = e^(Dt)x_0 from t=0 to t=T."
