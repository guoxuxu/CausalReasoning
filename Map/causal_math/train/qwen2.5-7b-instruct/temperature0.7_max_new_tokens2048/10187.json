  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a control system operates following a linear equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), with K being a constant coefficient matrix and u representing external control influences. Suppose an experimental transformation \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) is introduced, where A is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new control vector \\\\( u \\\\) is introduced, changing the system's dynamics, does the system's state at time T > t_1 depend only on K, ignoring the effects of A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new control vector \\\\( u \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) indeed modifies the system trajectory based on K. However, since the initial state modification by \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) potentially changes the basis in which the dynamics evolve, the final state at time T is influenced by both A and K. The system’s response reflects composite effects of both matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of a new control vector u directly influences the system state y, and this influence is mediated through the constant coefficient matrix K. The matrix A does not directly affect the system state y under the given conditions."
