  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The differential equation governing the dynamics is \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). When this new initial condition evolves, the solution to the differential equation is \\\\( z(t) = e^{-i\\\\lambda t}e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) rather than \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda t}z_0 \\\\), representing a phase shift introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) transforms z_0 over time t to z(t), while the differential equation dz/dt = -iλz directly evolves z_0 to z(t) over the same period, with λ determining the rate of change."
