  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\), where D is a linear differential operator. Investigate the influence of a transformation characterised by \\\\( h(z) = z^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\) on the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where k is a non-zero scalar and C is a constant.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new function \\\\( j(z) = z^{m}e^{Dt} \\\\) (where m is a scalar and D is a constant) is applied at some point \\\\( x_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(X) \\\\) for X > x_1 be influenced only by the operator D and not C or k?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( j(z) \\\\) as an intervention at \\\\( x_1 \\\\) adds another dimension of transformation, affecting the ultimate state at X. This state depends not only on D but also significantly on the effects of transformations C and k from \\\\( h(z) \\\\) as well as m and D from \\\\( j(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The differential operator D influences the rate of change of z, while the transformations h(z) and j(z) directly affect z. Applying j(z) at x_1 will change z's behavior such that its end state for X > x_1 is influenced by the constants D and m in j(z), but not by C from h(z) or k."
