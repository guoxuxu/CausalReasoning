  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a circular motion in the complex plane. We then examine the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nGiven the state at \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\), and knowing an intervention occurred, can we determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the value of \\\\( z(\\pi) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the transformations and intervention can overlap in the complex plane due to their respective impacts on phase and magnitude. Multiple combinations of applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could yield the same endpoint, especially given the periodic nature of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This non-uniqueness prevents clear inference of the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
