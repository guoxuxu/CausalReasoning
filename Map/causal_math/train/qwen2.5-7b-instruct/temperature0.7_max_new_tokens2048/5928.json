  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), that changes the representation of \\\\(u\\\\) from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nGiven only the function at time \\\\(T\\\\) after interventions involving potential changes in operators from \\\\(L\\\\) to \\\\(M\\\\) and application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), can the specific nature of the interventions (i.e., whether and when \\\\(L\\\\) was switched to \\\\(M\\\\)) be clearly determined?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint data at \\\\(T\\\\) after multiple possible transformations and operator changes does not uniquely identify which interventions occurred or their exact timing. The effects of different operators and the properties of the Fourier transform create multiple plausible intervention paths leading to the same observable end state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in the operator from L to M directly influences the time derivative of u (u_t), which in turn affects the state of u at time T (u_T). The Fourier transform (\\(\\mathcal{F}\\)) converts u from the time domain to the frequency domain (u_freq)."
