  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(z(t))dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace-like transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) results in a loss of information specific to initial conditions since it aggregates the influence of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over an infinite range. The transformation's irreversible nature means that multiple possible initial states could lead to the same transformed outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences T[f](z) through the integral transformation. The constant ω affects z(t) by governing its dynamics. The complex number s influences T[f](z) by shaping the weight of z(t) over time in the integral."
