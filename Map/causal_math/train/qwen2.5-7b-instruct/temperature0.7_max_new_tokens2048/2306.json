  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = cos(x) + i sin(x) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let us examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( z(x) t= e^tx \\\\) on this complex function over a time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the value of \\\\( t \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( z(x, t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the exponential function and its effect on the rotation of the complex function, the exact value of \\\\( t \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) cannot be deduced only from the observations at \\\\( t = T \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^tx \\\\) affects the function's argument, leading to different rotations depending on the initial value of \\\\( t \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of t influences z(x, t), which in turn affects z(x). Observing z(x, T) allows us to infer the value of t at t = 0 without prior knowledge of the transformation."
