  "Problem": "A complex line integral is evaluated along different paths in a complex domain. The function is \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and the integral paths are circles centered at 0 with varying radii. We explore the impact of modifications to the path (change in the radius).\n\nGiven the integral result along a path (circle), without knowing the specific radius of the circle, can we deduce the exact radius used?",
  "Explanation": "The integral result of \\\\(2\\\\pi i\\\\) is the same for any circle centered at the origin that encloses the singularity at z=0. Multiple radii produce the same integral result, making it impossible to identify the specific radius just from the integral value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
