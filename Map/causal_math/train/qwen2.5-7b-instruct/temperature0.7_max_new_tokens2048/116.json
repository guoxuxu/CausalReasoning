  "Problem": "Consider a complex system represented by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant indicating the angular frequency. The behavior of the system under two different types of transformations, the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) and its inverse \\\\(L^{-1}\\\\) is examined over time.\n\nGiven the end behavior observed in \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we exactly determine which transformations (\\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(F\\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the end behavior?",
  "Explanation": "The end behavior at \\\\(t = T\\\\) could result from different combinations of transformations, especially if interactions between the operations of the Laplace and Fourier transforms yield non-unique modifications. This ambiguity means specific interventions cannot be uniquely determined only from the end behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at time t=T influences the observed end behavior; applying the Laplace transform L to z(t) results in transformed behavior; applying the inverse Laplace transform L^{-1} to the transformed behavior yields the original behavior."
