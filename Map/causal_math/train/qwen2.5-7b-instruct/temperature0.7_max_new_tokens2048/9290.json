  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{(iBt)}z\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another real constant, on the behavior of the function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nCan we accurately deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), determining whether the evolution included a transformation by \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) initially is not possible. The phase shift introduced by \\\\( B \\\\) impacts the trajectory such that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could correspond to various possible initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to t is influenced by A, and the transformation h(z) applied to z results in z(T) at time T."
