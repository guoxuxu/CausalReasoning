  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}u \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex constant vector. This function is acted upon by a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original vector \\\\( u \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from either \\\\( e^{iAt}u \\\\) or \\\\( e^{iAt}Cu \\\\). Since C can fundamentally change the vector space and e^(iAT)'s effects cannot be uniquely reversed without this knowledge, multiple potentials for \\\\( u \\\\) exist.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
