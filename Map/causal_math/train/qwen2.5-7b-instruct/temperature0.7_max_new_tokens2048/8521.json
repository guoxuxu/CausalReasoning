  "Problem": "Assume we are examining two parameterized functions, \\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\) and \\( g(w) = e^{\\lambda w} \\), where \\( c \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are complex numbers. We explore the effects of transformations involving these functions on the complex plane over parameter \\( t \\).\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is substituted into \\( g(w) \\) such that \\( w = f(z) \\), i.e., \\( w = z^2 + cz \\) and then \\( g(w) \\) evolves over \\( t \\), will the resulting function \\( g(w(t)) \\) merely be \\( e^{(z^2+cz)\\lambda t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Direct substitution of \\( w = f(z) = z^2 + cz \\) into \\( g(w) \\) transforms \\( g(w) = e^{\\lambda w} \\) to \\( g(f(z)) = e^{\\lambda(z^2 + cz)} \\). Applying the time parameter \\( t \\) simply advances this function to \\( e^{\\lambda t(z^2 + cz)} \\), following exponential rules naturally without altering the functional relationship.",
