  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in terms of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), such that \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a positive real constant. Analyzing the effect of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant. Observations are made over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) until time T without further modification, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) equal the result of evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) directly to T?",
  "Explanation": "By applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0, the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( e^{iB0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\). Although it appears unchanged initially, the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) changes due to the exponential multiplier affecting the phase of the complex plane. \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus evolves to \\\\( e^{i(AT+BT)}z_0 \\\\) rather than \\\\( e^{iAT}z_0 \\\\). The additional phase shift due to B results in a different endpoint.",
