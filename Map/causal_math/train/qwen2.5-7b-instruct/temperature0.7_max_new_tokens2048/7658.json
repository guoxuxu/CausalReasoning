  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain, can we uniquely determine the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the system's response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), the inverse transformation to recover \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is not uniquely determinable because there could be many different input functions that, when combined with different system responses, could yield the same output spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
