  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing the amplitude and angular frequency respectively. For analysis, a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) is used, representing a Fourier transform component.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed at t = 0 using \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and then evolves over time T without further intervention, will the transformed function be constant over time?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is effectively an integral transformation capturing the frequency component of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since this transformation extracts a constant coefficient from the periodic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the result does not change over time T, yielding a constant value.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The amplitude r and angular frequency ω determine z(t); time t influences z(t); duration T determines the transformation f(z); the initial function z(t) at t=0 through transformation f(z) results in a function that may vary over time T."
