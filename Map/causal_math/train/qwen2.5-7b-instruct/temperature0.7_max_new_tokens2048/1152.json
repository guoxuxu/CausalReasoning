  "Problem": "Assume a function defined on complex numbers \\\\(z\\\\) as \\\\(f(z) = e^{az}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. This function undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\) for \\\\(\\\\operatorname{Re}(s) > \\\\operatorname{Re}(a)\\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation on various scenarios.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform output \\\\(G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2}\\\\), can we precisely infer the original function type (was it \\\\(e^{az}\\\\) or another function) and the nature of the intervention applied?",
  "Explanation": "While we can guess that the original function involved the parameter \\\\(a\\\\), we cannot definitively determine if the original function was exclusively \\\\(e^{az}\\\\) or if other functions involving \\\\(a\\\\) were used before the intervention, nor can we specify the exact nature of the intervention just based on \\\\(G(s)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(z) = e^(az) directly influences the modified Laplace transform G(s) = 1/((s-a)^2), and the complex constant a directly influences both f(z) and G(s)."
