  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where c is a constant. Investigate the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{-sx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied at t = 0.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively determine which transformations were applied (\\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( G(u) \\\\), or both) at earlier times, based only on the state at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping integral effects of \\\\( e^{-sx} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{kx} \\\\) in the transformations can result in similar outcomes for \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\) that might be indistinguishable without additional information. Therefore, the exact details of the interventions can't be uniquely identified from the final transformed state alone due to the convolution-like nature of the process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T applied to u results in T(u)(T), which depends on the function u(x,t) and the parameter s. The transformation T(u) at time t = 0 influences the state of the system at later times through the given PDE."
