  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) and transformations are applied as \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, deducing the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous as \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduces a multiplicative factor \\\\( e^{kT} \\\\) that cannot be unfolded or identified solely from observing the state at time T.",
