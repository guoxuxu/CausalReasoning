  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Analyze the response of the function under an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) solely depend on the properties of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) without any external factors?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) acts directly on the complex function, integrating it over the specified interval. The outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depends only on the behavior of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) in the interval from 0 to T under the given transformation, without additional influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of T[z](T) depends on e^(it) and e^s, where the integral transformation T aggregates the effect of e^s over the interval [0, T] to determine T[z](T)."
