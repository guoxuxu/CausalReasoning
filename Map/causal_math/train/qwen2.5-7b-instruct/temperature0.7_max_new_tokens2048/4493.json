  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a linear transformation on a complex function. Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, representing a unit circle in the complex plane. The transformation given is \\\\( T(z) = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) = kz \\\\) scales the radius of the circle by \\\\( k \\\\), altering the magnitude of the initial point. Therefore, while the angle traversed after time T remains the same, the radius (magnitude) is different, leading to a different complex number at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T to z_0 results in T(z_0), which evolves over time as z(t) = e^(it). Without further intervention, z(t) at t = T under the transformation T is equivalent to evolving z_0 directly to t = T under z(t) = e^(it)."
