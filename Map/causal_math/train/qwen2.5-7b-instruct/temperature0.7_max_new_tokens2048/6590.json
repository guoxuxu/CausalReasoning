  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and A is a complex constant. The transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B being another complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowledge about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, and considering the properties of exponential functions with complex numbers, the original value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can be obscured due to various potential modulations by \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) which can significantly alter trajectories.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0, through the transformation by the complex exponential function with constant A, determines z(T). Similarly, the constant B in another transformation function affects z(T)."
