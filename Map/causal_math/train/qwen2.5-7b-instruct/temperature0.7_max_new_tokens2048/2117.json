  "Problem": "Consider a functional equation \\\\( v(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(x,t)u(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input function. The transformation applied is \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the input function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( u'(t) = u(t) + d \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) at t = 0, and the system evolves naturally without further intervention, will the transformed output \\\\( w'(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was directly processed to generate \\\\( w(x) \\\\) at x = X?",
  "Explanation": "The modification in \\\\( u(t) \\\\) by adding a constant \\\\( d \\\\) will lead to a corresponding change in the integral computation of \\\\( v(x) \\\\), shifting it by \\\\( d \\\\) times the integral of the kernel over t, and thus \\\\( w'(x) \\\\) will also be shifted by the same amount, differing from the original \\\\( w(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When the input function u(t) is modified to u'(t) = u(t) + d at t = 0, the output v'(x) becomes v(x) + c due to the integral transformation. Consequently, the transformed output w'(x) = v'(x) + c equals v(x) + 2c, which is different from w(x) = v(x) + c unless c = 0."
