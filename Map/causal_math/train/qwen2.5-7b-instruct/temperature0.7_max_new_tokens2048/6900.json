  "Problem": "Assess the interplay between a time-varying voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) applied across a linear system with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\. The output voltage across the system is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (v * h)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the combined response output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) after the intervention with the new voltage source, can we precisely identify what the original voltage \\\\( v(t) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( v'(t) \\\\) were?",
  "Explanation": "Ascertaining the exact forms of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v'(t) \\\\) solely from the combined output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) is impractical without further information, due to the superposition principle of linear systems. Without knowing the specifics of each source's frequency and amplitude, multiple voltage configurations might yield the same convolution output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time-varying voltage function v(t) directly causes the output voltage y(t), and the intervention voltage v'(t) directly causes the modified output voltage y'(t). The original output y(t) and the intervened output y'(t) are related through the changes introduced by v'(t)."
