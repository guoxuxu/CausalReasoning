  "Problem": "Investigate a linear system governed by \\\\( dX = NX dt + M dW_t \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Wiener process (Brownian motion). We hypothesize a transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Kt} X \\\\) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) being another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(X) \\\\), the original vector \\\\( X_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced because the transformation \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\) can significantly alter the initial state, interacting uniquely with the system's dynamics and the stochastic noise.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
