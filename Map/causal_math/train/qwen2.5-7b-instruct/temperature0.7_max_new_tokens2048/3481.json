  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We study the implications of modifying this integral using a linear transformation of the variable x given by the function \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x \\\\) and then \\\\( F \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will \\\\( F(ax + b) \\\\) at x = T be the same as if \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was calculated directly at x = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\) changes the limits of integration in the function \\\\( F \\\\), which in turn affects the result of the integral. Since integration is sensitive to its variable's upper and lower bounds, the value of \\\\( F(ax + b) \\\\) will differ from \\\\( F(x) \\\\) at the same point due to the linear transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation g(x) = ax + b to x and then calculating F(ax + b) at x = T will generally yield different results compared to calculating F(x) directly at x = T, unless specific conditions on a and b are met."
