  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\) that describes heat diffusion in a rod. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{w x} \\\\), where w is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial profile by adding \\\\( e^{w x} \\\\), which affects the solution to the heat equation. The solution will differ from the profile evolved directly from \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at time T because the added exponential term evolves differently under the heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying g(u) to the initial condition u_0(x) transforms it to a new initial condition which then evolves under the heat diffusion PDE to produce u(x, t) at time t, whereas directly evolving u_0(x) under the same PDE produces a different u(x, t) at the same time; thus, the two temperature profiles are not the same."
