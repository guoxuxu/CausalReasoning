  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time t according to the integral transform \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with K(s) being a complex kernel function. The initial condition at t = 0 is \\\\(z_0\\\\). An intervention function \\\\(h(t, z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves from \\\\(z_0\\\\) over a period T according to the given integral transformation without any intervention, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) be independent of the choice of the kernel function K(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is directly dependent on the form of the kernel function K(s). Different choices of K(s) will generally result in different trajectories and endpoints for \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
