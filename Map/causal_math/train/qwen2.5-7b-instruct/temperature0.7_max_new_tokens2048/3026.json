  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). We examine how the system evolves with and without the application of \\\\( T \\\\) over time.\n\nKnowing the function state at time T, and assuming no transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, can we unequivocally reconstruct the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "In this case, the path is uniquely determined by the natural evolution of the function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), and with knowledge that no transformation was applied, reconstructing the path from initial state to T is straightforward as it follows the known exponential behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves over time t, and this evolution is integrated by T(z) to produce T(z). The initial state z(0) determines the form of z(t), and the application of T(z) over time t transforms z(t) into T(z)."
