  "Problem": "Consider the impact of two different integral transforms on a function h(t), one being the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and the other being the Fourier Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). These transformations are applied to h(t) to evaluate their influences and potentially infer properties of h(t) from their transformations. The function \\( h(t) = e^{-kt} \\) for \\( k > 0 \\).\n\nSuppose an intervention involves modifying h(t) to h'(t) by adding a constant m to k, making h'(t) = e^{-(k+m)t}. Will the Laplace Transform of h'(t) be directly influenced by this modification?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the decay rate from k to k + m. The Laplace Transform of h'(t) will show this as a shift in the pole from \\( \\\\frac{1}{s+k} \\) to \\( \\\\frac{1}{s+k+m} \\), clearly indicating an effect of the intervention on the transformed output.",
