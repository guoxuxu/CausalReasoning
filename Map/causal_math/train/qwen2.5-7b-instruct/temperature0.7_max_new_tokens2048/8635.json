  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier transform scenario where a given function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) on the domain \\\\( t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) undergoes the transformation defined by \\\\( F(\\xi) = \\\\mathcal{F}(f(t))(\\\\xi) \\\\), which is the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The variable \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\) denotes frequency. The effect of a multiplicative modulation by a cosine wave, \\\\( h(t) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\), on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is considered, i.e., the new function becomes \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\).\n\nIf during the process of transformation, an additional modulation by \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega_1 t} \\\\) is applied, will the resulting function's transform, \\\\( H(\\\\xi) \\\\), directly relate solely to \\\\( F(\\\\xi) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional modulation introduces another frequency shift, resulting in \\\\( F(\\\\xi) \\\\) being affected by both \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) from \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_1 \\\\) from the intervention. The resultant spectrum \\\\( H(\\\\xi) \\\\) is a complex interplay of these frequencies, not just a simple transformation of \\\\( F(\\\\xi) \\\\).",
