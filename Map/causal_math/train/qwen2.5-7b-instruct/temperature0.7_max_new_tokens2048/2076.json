  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation on a complex function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\\\), where the integral is taken over a suitable contour in the complex plane. We explore how the transformation affects the inversion of the function via the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nConsidering that an unknown filtering function \\\\( H(z) \\\\) was used along with \\\\( G(z) \\\\), can we determine both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(z) \\\\) from the convoluted output obtained after applying the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(z) \\\\) from their convolution result via inverse Laplace transform requires additional information about either function, as the convolution typically erases unique identifiers that distinguish one from another without extra constraints or data.",
