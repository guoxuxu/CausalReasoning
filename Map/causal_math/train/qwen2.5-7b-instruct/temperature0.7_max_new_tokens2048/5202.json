  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real frequency parameter. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf we observe \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to determine whether the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulted from the natural evolution \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\) or the altered evolution \\\\( e^{aT}e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\). The function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an ambiguity in possible initial conditions, making it impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
