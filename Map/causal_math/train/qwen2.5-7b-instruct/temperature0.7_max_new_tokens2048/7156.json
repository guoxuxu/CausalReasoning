  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we unequivocally determine the parameters \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), given the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after applying both the initial Fourier transform and the phase shift transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of both an original system property \\\\( A \\\\) and an intervening phase shift \\\\( B \\\\) complicates the backtracking process. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can emerge from different combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), especially given the overlap in effects that both parameters might produce on the function's evolution. Distinguishing between these combined effects just from the end state without additional information is generally infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
