  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The scenario investigates how the function's behavior changes under various transformations, particularly a transformation applied by an integral operator \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(Tf(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\alpha s} f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a fixed real constant.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\(Tz(t)\\\\) at a specified time \\\\(t\\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) or the integral transformation parameters without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation process incorporates the integral which convolutes the effects of the original function and transformation parameters, making it challenging to disentangle and uniquely identify the initial function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) or the exact value of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) from the result \\\\(Tz(t)\\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformed function Tz(t) depends on the original function z(t) and the integral transformation parameter alpha. The value of alpha influences Tz(t), and knowing Tz(t) at a specific time provides information about both z(t) and alpha."
