  "Problem": "Examine the causal effects in a system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function f(t), focusing on the response of systems described by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\) where a is a constant.\n\nGiven the output response of the system, can we conclusively determine the value of \\\\( b \\\\) in the input function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) without being aware of the specific value of parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the system's transfer function?",
  "Explanation": "The output response is a convolution dependent on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), and with a change in \\\\( a \\\\), the identical output could be generated by different values of \\\\( b \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( a \\\\), the determination of \\\\( b \\\\) solely based on the output is indeterminate, due to the intertwined effects of these parameters in shaping the system’s response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
