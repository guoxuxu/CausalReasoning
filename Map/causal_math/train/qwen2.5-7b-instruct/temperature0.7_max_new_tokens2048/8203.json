  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( z \\) depends on the input \\( x \\) through a linear transformation and an integral transform with kernel \\( K(s, t) \\). Specifically, \\( z(t) = \\int_0^T K(s, t) x(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( T \\) is a fixed time horizon.\n\nSuppose an intervention modifies \\( x(s) \\) at a time \\( t_1 \\) within \\( [0, T] \\) by applying a matrix \\( B \\), changing the input to \\( x'(s) = Bx(s) \\) for \\( s \\geq t_1 \\). Will \\( z(T) \\) only depend on the post-intervention form of \\( x(s) \\) and not on the integral transformation properties?",
  "Explanation": "The modification \\( B \\) alters \\( x(s) \\) from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, but \\( z(T) \\) remains dependent on both the altered \\( x'(s) \\) and the kernel \\( K(s, t) \\). The entire history of \\( x(s) \\) over \\( [0, T] \\), modulated by \\( K(s, t) \\), influences \\( z(T) \\), making it dependent on both the pre- and post-intervention states and the kernel's characteristics.",
