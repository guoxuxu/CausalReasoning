  "Problem": "Examine a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) with an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\), where L represents a linear differential operator. We consider the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition.\n\nCan the precise sequence of transformations (initial Fourier transform and subsequent \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\)) be ascertained only by analyzing the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compounding effect of multiple transformations (Fourier and any other arbitrary \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\)) on the solution of the PDE makes it complex to unravel the exact sequence or types of transformations that were applied, especially without additional information about the specific operations used during each phase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, t); L → u(x, t); u(x, 0) → u(x, T); Fourier transform → U(k, 0); U(k, 0) → U(k, t); Fourier transform → G(U(k, t))",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) evolves over time under the operator L to become u(x, t), and further transforms to u(x, T) through time. Applying the Fourier transform to u(x, 0) results in U(k, 0), which then evolves to U(k, t) under the same operator L in the frequency domain, and finally, applying transformation G to U(k, t) yields the final state."
