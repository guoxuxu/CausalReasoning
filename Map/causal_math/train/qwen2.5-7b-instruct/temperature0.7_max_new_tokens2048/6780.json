  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) applied to a linear system characterized by \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where \\( D \\) is a constant matrix and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number. The system's evolution is influenced by the Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\), which transforms \\( x(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIs it possible to precisely identify the sequence or specific types of frequency transformations (both \\( z(t) \\) and \\( h(x) \\)) used throughout the evolution by observing the overall spectrum \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that transformations \\( z(t) \\) and \\( h(x) \\) might introduce or alter frequency components in cumulative and possibly overlapping ways, the final frequency spectrum \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) under these conditions will often not provide enough specificity to disentangle which transformations occurred and in which order. This ambiguity arises from the non-commutative properties of the transformations in the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences the Fourier transform of x(t), the system's dynamics governed by D affect x(t), and the Fourier transform of x(t) at time T depends on its Fourier transform at an earlier time."
