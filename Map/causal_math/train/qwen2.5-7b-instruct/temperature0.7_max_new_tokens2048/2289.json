  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. This function describes a circle in the complex plane over time. We investigate the impacts of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then let to evolve under its original dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T still represent a circular motion in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the original trajectory by introducing an exponential growth or decay factor depending on the real part of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The trajectory will no longer strictly represent circular motion, but rather a spiral depending on the nature of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial position z(0) determines z(T) through the evolution of the system's dynamics e^(iωt), and the transformation f(z) = ze^(αt) at t=0 modifies z(0) but the system continues to follow the circular motion described by e^(iωt) for t ≥ 0."
