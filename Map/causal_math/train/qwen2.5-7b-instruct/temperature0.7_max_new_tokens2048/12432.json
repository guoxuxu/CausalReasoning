  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear operator transformation on a Fourier series representation of a function. Let \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} a_n e^{inx} \\\\), and the transformation is defined by \\\\( T(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\), where \\\\( b_n \\\\) are coefficients modifying the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(g(x)) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) initially, and then allowed to evolve naturally (without further transformation), will the spectral characteristics (frequency components and their amplitudes) at some later time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\), thus altering the spectral characteristics of the function from the outset. As these coefficients define the amplitude and phases of the frequency components in the Fourier series, the transformed function will inherently possess different spectral properties compared to the original unmodified function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T(g(x)) → b_n a_n; a_n → g(x); g(x) → spectral characteristics",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of transformation T to g(x) modifies its Fourier coefficients a_n through b_n, which in turn changes the spectral characteristics of g(x). Without further transformation, the spectral characteristics at any later time t will differ from the original g(x) unless b_n equals 1 for all n."
