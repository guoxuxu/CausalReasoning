  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} + Bz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant complex numbers and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The situation investigates the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f(z)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over a period T.\n\nIf an intervention is made by changing the parameter B to a new value \\\\( B' \\\\) after some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the resulting transformation solely depend on the new value B' for the remaining duration from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "The change to B alters the contribution of the linear term \\\\( Bz \\\\) but does not erase the effects of the previously existing B value before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) nor the exponential component \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\). Thus, the transformation contains mixed effects from both B and B', alongside the ongoing impact of A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
