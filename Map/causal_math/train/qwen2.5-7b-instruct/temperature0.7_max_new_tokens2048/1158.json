  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore how the application of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix\\\\xi} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system.\n\nAfter observing the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) in frequency domain at T, can we deduce precisely the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) in spatial domain at t = 0 without knowing other initial conditions or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) precisely from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) is generally not possible without additional information about the operator L and its effect in the frequency space, as the transformation and evolution could correspond to multiple potential initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the Fourier transform L → ∂u/∂t → u → F(u) transforms the function u into F(u) in the frequency domain, and F(u)(ξ, T) in the frequency domain can be inversely transformed to recover u(x, 0) in the spatial domain at t = 0."
