  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the impact of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) applied at t = 0, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially, and since the transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) may change the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), it's impossible to confidently backtrack and uniquely deduce the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t is determined by its derivative with respect to time and the initial value z(0). The transformation g(z) applied at t=0 modifies z(0) to z(0)*e^(α*t) for t > 0. Knowing z(t) at t=T allows us to trace back to z(0) assuming no transformation g(z) was applied, but if g(z) was applied, z(0) cannot be uniquely determined from z(T) alone."
