  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dx = (Ax + u)dt + BdW\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are constant matrices, \\\\(u\\\\) is a control input, and \\\\(dW\\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We analyze how the output function \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) behaves under different conditions, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix outputting the observable state.\n\nIf a control input \\\\( u \\\\) is dynamically adjusted based on a feedback function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) throughout the interval \\\\([0, T]\\\\), will the output \\\\( f(x(T)) \\\\) depend only on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and the function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) irrespective of the stochasticity induced by \\\\( B \\\\) and the Wiener process?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the deterministic influence of \\\\( A \\\\) and the control strategy \\\\( u(x) \\\\), the output \\\\( f(x(T)) \\\\) is also influenced by the stochastic nature of the system due to the term \\\\( BdW \\\\), which introduces variability that the control and matrix \\\\( A \\\\) alone cannot completely dictate or cancel out.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
