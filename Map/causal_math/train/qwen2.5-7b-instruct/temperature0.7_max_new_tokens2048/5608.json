  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform, which transforms the function into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nCan we determine whether the original function or the modified function (after intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) generated a given transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), solely by examining the poles of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The poles of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) directly represent the frequency components embedded within the function. If \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(\\\\omega + k)} \\\\) is found, it indicates the presence of the intervened frequency \\\\( \\\\omega + k \\\\). Conversely, a pole at \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) suggests that the original function was unchanged. Thus, by analyzing the poles, we can determine the source frequency.",
