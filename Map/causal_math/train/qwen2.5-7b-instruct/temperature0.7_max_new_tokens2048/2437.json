  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by \\( Ax = b \\), where A is a non-singular matrix. An operator \\( T \\) defined by \\( T(x) = Ux \\) (where \\( U \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied, modifying the vector \\( x \\) in the space.\n\nIf \\( T(x) \\) is applied altering the initial vector \\( x_0 \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), and \\( x \\) evolves under \\( Ax = b \\) to \\( t = T \\) without further modifications, will \\( x(T) \\) represent the solution to \\( Ax = b \\) as if \\( T \\) were never applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T \\) to \\( x_0 \\) modifies the initial condition to \\( Ux_0 \\). Since the transformation by \\( U \\) changes the vector, and \\( A(Ux_0) = b \\) only if \\( U \\) is the inverse of \\( A \\), in general, the solution at \\( t = T \\) does not satisfy \\( Ax = b \\) unless \\( AUx_0 = b \\), which is generally not the case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying operator T to the initial vector x0 results in x, which then evolves under the linear equation Ax = b to become x(T), representing the solution to the equation as if T had never been applied."
