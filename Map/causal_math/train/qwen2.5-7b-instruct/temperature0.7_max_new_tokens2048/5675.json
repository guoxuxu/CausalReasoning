  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation using a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). This transformed signal is then filtered through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), impacting the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the Fourier Transform to a different integral transformation (say Laplace Transform) after the initial transformation at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the resultant signal at time \\\\( t_2 > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the initial transform and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the integral transformation as an intervention will affect the nature of the signal and thus interface differently with the transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). The output will depend on both the original Fourier Transform and the subsequent Laplace Transform application, reflecting compositional effects on the signal's spectrum.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) transforms via Fourier Transform F(x)(ω) which is then filtered by H(ω) to produce the output y(t). Modifying the Fourier Transform to a Laplace Transform changes the transformed signal F'(x)(ω), leading to a different output y'(t). Thus, the output y(t) at time t2 depends on the initial Fourier Transform F(x)(ω) rather than the subsequent Laplace Transform."
