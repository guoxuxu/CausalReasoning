  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving over time according to their respective differential equations, \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied for causal analysis.\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) for a certain s, can we uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) encapsulates the entire timeline of the system's evolution in a compressed, integral form. As such, it loses certain specific details about initial conditions due to the integration over time, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alone without additional constraints or assumptions about the system.",
