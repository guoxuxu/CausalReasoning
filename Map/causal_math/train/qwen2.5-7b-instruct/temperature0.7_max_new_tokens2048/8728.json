  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) on a vector \\\\( v \\\\) in a vector space, where A is a constant matrix. Assessing the role of an additive perturbation \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) applied to this transformation, where \\\\( w \\\\) is another constant vector.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( v(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations or interventions (\\\\( T(v) \\\\) and/or \\\\( g(v) \\\\)) were applied, based solely on the state \\\\( v(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The eventual state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) could be the result of different combinations of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( w \\\\), especially if the transformations and interventions have overlapping effects. Without additional information about the specific interventions or initial conditions, the exact history of transformations cannot be definitively determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
