  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable and f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact applying a Laplace transform on this function and then examining its behavior under various conditions.\n\nAfter observing the Laplace transform outcome \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of a function, can we categorically reconstruct the exact form of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), without knowing any specifics about its formulation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is generally not injective across all possible functions, meaning different functions can have the same Laplace transform (e.g., functions differing by a null function on the Laplace transform domain). Without additional information about specific constraints or the function behavior, exact reconstruction isn't always feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
