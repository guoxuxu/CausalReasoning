  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a variable capacitor (C(t)) affecting the voltage output across a resistor (V_R). The capacitor can change over time based on a function \\\\( C(t) = C_0 e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. This adjustment in capacitance dynamically influences the charging rate of the capacitor and therefore the voltage drops observed in the circuit.\n\nIf \\\\( C(t) \\\\) is manipulated to follow a specific profile described by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), without other interventions, will the voltage \\\\( V_R(t) \\\\) across the resistor at time T reflect only the changes due to \\\\( C(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in capacitance directly influences the charging rate, which in turn affects the voltage across the resistor. No other factors are considered, implying that the observed voltage change is a direct result of the capacitance change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The capacitance C(t) changes over time based on its initial value C_0 and the constant λ, which in turn affects the voltage V_R(t) across the resistor. Changes in C(t) directly cause variations in V_R(t)."
