  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\). We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform-based controller defined by \\( G(s) = s + k \\) for some constant \\( k \\) on the system's response.\n\nIf the system \\( H(s) \\) processes an input signal \\( u(t) \\) directly without any controllers, will the output \\( y(t) \\) be unaffected by any changes in \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the controller \\( G(s) \\) is not applied, the output \\( y(t) \\) is determined solely by \\( H(s) \\). Changes in \\( k \\) in the controller equation have no influence on \\( H(s) \\) or the output based solely on this system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k affects G(s), which in turn influences Y(s) through H(s). Changes in k do affect the output Y(s) because G(s) modifies the system's behavior before it is processed by H(s)."
