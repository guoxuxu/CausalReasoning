  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing the system's state over time. We analyze the impact of a Hilbert transform \\\\( H \\\\) which transforms a real function into another real function, typically shifting each frequency component by \\\\(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) of the function is transformed by \\\\( H \\\\), then allowed to evolve by the original system's dynamics without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) evolve identically to its evolution from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by the Hilbert transform alters the phase and potentially other properties of the signal’s components. This initial condition change affects the entire trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different state at time \\\\( T \\\\) than if the transformation hadn't been applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Hilbert transform to the initial condition z(0) and allowing it to evolve according to the system's dynamics results in the same z(T) as evolving z(0) without the transform."
