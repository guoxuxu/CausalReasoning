  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t, z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f \\\\) involves a mixture of linear algebraic operations and integral transformations. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} z dt \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the exact original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) throughout [0, T] after observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) is infeasible as the transformation complicates the direct relationship between initial conditions and the final state. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) involves an integral which might not be invertible or determinable from final conditions alone.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
