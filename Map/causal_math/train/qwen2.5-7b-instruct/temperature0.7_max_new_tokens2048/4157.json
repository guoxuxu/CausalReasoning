  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nIf \\(z(t) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\) is transformed at \\(t = 0\\) and then evolved under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) without any further intervention, will \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > 0\\) still mimic the dynamics of \\(z(t) = e^{Ct}z_0\\) in the original, untransformed system?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\) significantly changes the frequency components of the initial vector \\(z_0\\). When evolved under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), the altered frequency components will result in different dynamics, leading to a system state at \\(T\\) that differs fundamentally from \\(e^{Ct}z_0\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0 directly influences z(0), which then evolves over time under the dynamics specified by C to become z(T)."
