  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the impact of a transformation using Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if no Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the representation from time domain to frequency domain and does not affect the state dynamics directly. However, the initial application of the Fourier transform doesn't modify the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself in the time domain; the resulting Fourier transform at time \\\\( T \\\\) reflects the state evolved from the original, untransformed \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition F(z_0) directly influences the Fourier transform of the function F(z) at any time t. The evolution of z(t) under the differential equation Dz directly determines z(t). Consequently, the Fourier transform of z(t) at time T, F(z(T)), depends on the Fourier transform of the initial condition and the dynamics dictated by D."
