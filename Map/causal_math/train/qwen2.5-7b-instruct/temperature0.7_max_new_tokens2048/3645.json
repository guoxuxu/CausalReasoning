  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant complex number. Study the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to initialize \\\\( z_0 = T(z(0)) \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T follow the same trajectory as if \\\\( z \\\\) was evolved directly from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the initial condition transformed by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is essentially a scaled version of its original state with the influence of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) offset by the transformation, the resulting dynamics effectively trace the same path, merely adjusted proportionally by the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) influences T(z(0)), which then determines z_0. Subsequently, z_0 dictates the evolution of z(t) according to the differential equation, while z'(t) represents the rate of change of z(t) that drives its trajectory."
