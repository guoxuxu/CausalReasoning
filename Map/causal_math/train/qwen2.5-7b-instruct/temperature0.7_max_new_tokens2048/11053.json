  "Problem": "We consider a complex function transformation in the context of an integral transformation. The initial function is \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an original real-valued function. We analyze applying a transformation \\\\( h(t) = k(t) * f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( * \\\\) denotes convolution with a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and this new function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is then integrated as in the initial scenario, will the resulting transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) be equivalent to applying the original transformation directly to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) alters \\\\( f(t) \\\\), which changes the integrand in the original transformation. The properties of convolution in integral transforms generally result in modifications of the original function's behavior in the complex plane, hence yielding a different transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(t) influences g(z) through integration, and when f(t) is transformed via convolution with k(t) to produce h(t), h(t) can be integrated to produce a new g(z) that may or may not be equivalent to the original g(z) depending on the kernel k(t)."
