  "Problem": "Consider a physical system characterized by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) represents a potential function in a field. The transformation applied is through a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex representation of spatial coordinates.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the spatial coordinate \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and the potential \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is then allowed to solve Laplace's equation without further intervention, will the solution \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y, t)\\\\) at a time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if the coordinate \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was not transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the spatial argument, effectively altering the boundary or initial conditions under which Laplace's equation is solved. This will generally lead to different solutions, as the original and transformed coordinates would cover different potential solutions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) to the spatial coordinate z_0 at t=0 changes the potential φ, which then evolves according to Laplace's equation independently of further coordinate transformations. Thus, the potential φ at time t=T will differ from the scenario where z_0 was not transformed."
