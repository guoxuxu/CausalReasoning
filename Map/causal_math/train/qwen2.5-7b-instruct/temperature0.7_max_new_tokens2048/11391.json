  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The integral transformation maps the time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at different complex values of \\\\( s \\\\) is of interest.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z * e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) is applied at a point during the transformation process, will the final form of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) be influenced only by the combined parameters of \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( s \\\\), and the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) effectively changes the functional form that is being transformed. Consequently, the final function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is recalculated with the modified \\\\( z(t) = z(t) * e^{bt} \\\\), making the result dependent on \\\\( s \\\\), \\\\( a \\\\), and now also \\\\( b \\\\). The causality flows through these parameters without external factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time function z(t) directly influences the complex function h(z) through the integral transformation. The complex constant s directly influences h(z) by determining the exponential factor in the integrand. The constant b directly influences g(z) by scaling z(t) in the time domain. The transformation g(z) directly influences h(z) by altering the input before the integral transformation."
