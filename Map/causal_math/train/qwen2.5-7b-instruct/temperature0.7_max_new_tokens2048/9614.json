  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the effect of two linear transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = az \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = bz \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are non-zero complex constants, on the mapping described by \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the input complex number \\\\( z \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( T_1 \\\\) or \\\\( T_2 \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( T_1 \\\\) and \\\\( T_2 \\\\) could scale \\\\( z \\\\) differently, leading to multiple potential original inputs that could yield the same output under \\\\( f \\\\). Without knowing the exact transformation, one cannot uniquely determine the original \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Given the output of f(z), we cannot unequivocally determine the input complex number z without knowing if T1 or T2 was applied because T1(z) → f(T1(z)) and T2(z) → f(T2(z)) map different inputs to potentially overlapping outputs."
