  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a vector space described by a matrix 𝐌. An integral transformation \\\\( T[𝐱](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}𝐌𝐱(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where 𝐱(t) is a vector function affected over time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the matrix \\\\( 𝐌 \\\\) is changed to a new matrix \\\\( 𝐍 \\\\) as an intervention, and then \\\\( 𝐱(t) \\\\) is transformed, will the resulting \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\) still only depend on the original parameters of \\\\( 𝐌 \\\\) and not on \\\\( 𝐍 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing 𝐌 to 𝐍 modifies not only the trajectory of \\\\( 𝐱(t) \\\\) from that point onwards but also impacts the overall integral transformation. Therefore, \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\) post-intervention will reflect the effects of both 𝐌 and 𝐍, showing dependency on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
