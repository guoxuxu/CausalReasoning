  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We explore the behavior of the function under different transformations and integration conditions.\n\nAfter applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) = ax + b \\\\) and calculating \\\\( z(h(x)) \\\\), is it possible to deduce the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) solely from the resulting \\\\( z(h(x)) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it is not feasible to reverse engineer the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) from \\\\( z(h(x)) \\\\). The transformation parameters critically affect how the integral's limits and integrand are modified, necessary information for deconvolving back to \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
