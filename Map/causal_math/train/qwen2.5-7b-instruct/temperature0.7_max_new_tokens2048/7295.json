  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator on function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\). To analyze the system's behavior, we explore the effect of applying Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), particularly focusing on the transformation over time.\n\nIf during the evolution an additional transformation defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}[u] = \\\\mathcal{F}[G(x)u]\\\\) (where \\\\(G(x)\\\\) is a spatially varying function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, T)\\\\) depend only on operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not on \\\\(G(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\) alters the spatial domain properties of the function, which when transformed could lead to a different evolution trajectory under \\\\(L\\\\). This makes the final state dependent not only on the original PDE operator but also significantly on the intervention by \\\\(G(x)\\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
