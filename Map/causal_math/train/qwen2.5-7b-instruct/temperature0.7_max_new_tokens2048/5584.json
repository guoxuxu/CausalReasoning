  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real numbers and represent the real and imaginary components of the exponent, respectively. The transformation is studied in the context of its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at time T with a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega = 2B \\\\), can it be definitively concluded that the modification \\\\( e^{2iBt} \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) without knowing other system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "While the peak at \\\\( \\\\omega = 2B \\\\) suggests an intervention influencing the imaginary component, it cannot conclusively determine the nature or timing of the intervention. Multiple interventions or variations in system dynamics could produce similar transformations in the Fourier Spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
