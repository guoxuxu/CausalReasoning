  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing oscillations influenced by a damping constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). The function is transformed using the Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F'(s) \\\\), is it feasible to accurately specify whether the amplification intervention used was scalar or functional (e.g., non-linear transformation) by analyzing the form of \\\\( F'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature of the intervention (scalar versus functional) solely from the Laplace Transform \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) is challenging without additional constraints or data about the temporal behavior of the interventions, as both types of interventions could result in proportional changes in \\\\( F(s) \\\\), but through different mechanisms.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
