  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state in the complex plane. We assess the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then left to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = \\\\pi / \\\\omega_0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T = \\\\pi / \\\\omega_0?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) significantly modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{kz_0} \\\\), which fundamentally alters the initial phase and magnitude in complex plane. Hence, the trajectory and the final state at \\\\( T = \\\\pi / \\\\omega_0 \\\\) will differ from the unaltered evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly causes z(t) through the evolution equation z(t) = e^(iω_0 t)z_0. Applying the transformation f(z) to z_0 at t=0 before evolving it to T=π/ω_0 results in a different z(T) compared to directly evolving z_0 to T=π/ω_0."
