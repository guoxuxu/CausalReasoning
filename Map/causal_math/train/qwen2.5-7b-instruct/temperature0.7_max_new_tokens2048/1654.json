  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Nt} z \\\\, dt \\\\), with N also being a constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time T.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was processed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and subsequently evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and not the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) before evolution under \\\\( M \\\\), leaves ambiguity in backward tracing to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The integral transformation could have modified the trajectory in ways that are non-reversible solely with the knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation h(z) to z_0 results in z(T), and the subsequent evolution of z(T) under the differential equation dz/dt = Mz leads to z(T) as well."
