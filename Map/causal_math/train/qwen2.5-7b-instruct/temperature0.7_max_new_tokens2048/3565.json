  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We study the effect of the Laplace transform applied to \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its subsequent inverse transformation using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\) rather than \\\\( a \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is taken and then the inverse Laplace transform is applied with the original parameter \\\\( a \\\\), will the final expression for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time domain remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse using the same parameter \\\\( a \\\\) completely recovers the original function \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the complex domain, thus remaining unchanged in the time domain representation.",
