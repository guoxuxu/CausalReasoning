  "Problem": "Analyze a complex dynamical system represented by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and z is a complex function. The evolution is studied under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T equate to the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) for time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition, affecting the evolution of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could alter the complex dynamics by interacting with the matrix C, the resultant state at time T could differ significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
