  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform on a causal system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -Ax + u(t) \\\\), where A is a constant scalar and u(t) is an external input. Assume \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of u(t) and consider the impact of transforming the initial conditions via a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the system dynamics are modified at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by changing A to a new constant \\\\( B \\\\), and the input function u(t) is also changed at that time, will the Fourier-transformed state of the system at a later time t depend exclusively on the new dynamics and new input?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier-transformed state depends on the entire history of the system including the effects of the original dynamics characterized by A prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\), as well as the impacts of the intervention with new dynamics B and the changed input function. This history impacts the frequency components and their phases.",
