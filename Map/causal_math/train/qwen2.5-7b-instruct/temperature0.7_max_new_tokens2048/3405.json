  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) be the same as without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the phase of the signal uniformly across all time, resulting in a phase shift in the Fourier transform. This phase shift does not change the amplitude spectrum but alters the phase spectrum, indicating a causal effect from the transformation to the frequency domain representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a phase shift transformation h(z) = e^(iθ)z to the signal z(t) results in a corresponding phase shift in its Fourier transform Z(ω), so Z(ω) after applying h(z) is not the same as Z(ω) without applying h(z)."
