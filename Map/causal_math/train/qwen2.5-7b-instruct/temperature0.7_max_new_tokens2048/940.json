  "Problem": "Consider a system of ordinary differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = M z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Let's analyze the behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = D e^{-Mt} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied and in what sequence – whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), both, or in some specific order – just by the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific influence of non-commutative matrix exponentials and possible overlap in the transformation effects lead to different possible paths or interventions resulting in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). These complexities make it infeasible to distinctly ascertain the type or sequence of interventions used solely based on the end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "z(t) → z(T); M → z(t+dt); D → h(z); t → z(t); M → h(z); k(z) → h(z); T → z(T); h(z) → z(T); k(z) → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(t) evolves over time t according to the matrix M; applying the transformation D to z(t) at time t yields h(z); the final state z(T) depends on the initial state z(t), the transformation D, and the time T; applying another transformation k(z) also affects h(z) and consequently z(T)."
