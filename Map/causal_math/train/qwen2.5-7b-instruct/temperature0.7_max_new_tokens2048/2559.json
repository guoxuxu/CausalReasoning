  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in a complex plane, described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. We introduce a transformation given by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, affecting the amplitude and phase of \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a new mapping \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions using \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) significantly influence the trajectory and the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Each of the transformations associated with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) affects the amplitude and phase of the trajectory, leading to a dependency on both in addition to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω directly influences the state z(t), while the constants α and β influence z(t) through the transformations f(z) and g(z) respectively. Applying the intervention g(z) at time t_1 does not change the fact that z(T) for T > t_1 depends primarily on ω."
