  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) on the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real, positive constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The impact of transforming the system using \\\\( z(t) x(t) \\\\) is studied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( w(t) = e^{i \\\\gamma t} \\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention on the system, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be dependent only on \\\\( -\\\\lambda \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( w(t) \\\\) introduces additional phase shifts and potentially alters the magnitude based on \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), making the final state of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) as well as \\\\( -\\\\lambda \\\\). The system's trajectory can significantly change due to these composite effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
