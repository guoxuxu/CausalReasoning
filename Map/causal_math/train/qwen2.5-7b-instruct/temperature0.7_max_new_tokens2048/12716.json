  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and we examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. This scenario explores the transformations under different conditions and interventions using the residue theorem from complex analysis.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed, will this result in the same outcome as applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and transforming the result using \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation before or after the function yields different results due to the non-commutative nature of addition and exponentiation in the complex plane. Specifically, \\\\( f(T(z_0)) = e^{az_0 + b} \\\\) which does not equal to \\\\( T(f(z_0)) = ae^{z_0} + b \\\\), thus changing the nature of the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation T(z) followed by the function f(z) results in a different outcome compared to applying f(z) to z_0 and then applying T(z) to the result."
