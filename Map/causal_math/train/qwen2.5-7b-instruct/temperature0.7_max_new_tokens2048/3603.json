  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the input and output of an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The input function is \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the output function is defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^T K(t,s)x(s) ds \\\\). Here T is a constant and the transformation is observed up to time T.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), the kernel function is switched from \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\) to a modified function \\\\( K'(t,s) = f(t,s) * e^{A(t-s)} \\\\) (where f(t, s) is a continuous function), will the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) be affected by this change assuming we know A?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the kernel function, even momentarily, with an additional multiplicative factor \\\\( f(t,s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will alter the integral, and thus change the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\). This intervention impacts the way input is integrated from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, affecting the resultant \\\\( y(T) \\\\) even if the original dynamics (A) are known.",
