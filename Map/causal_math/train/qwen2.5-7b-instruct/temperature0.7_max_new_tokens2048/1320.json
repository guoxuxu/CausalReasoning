  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} ds \\), which represents a transformation applied to a real domain variable t. Here, s is a complex parameter and we are analyzing the behavior under linear transformations represented by matrix multiplication.\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were used (initially with A and later with B) by observing only the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the additive and non-commutative nature of integrating over paths affected by different matrix transformations, multiple combinations of A and B can lead to the same result in \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the end result doesn't uniquely define the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A and B both influence s, which in turn influences z(t) through the integral transformation. Observing z(T) allows inference about s but not uniquely about A and B."
