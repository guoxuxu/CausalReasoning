  "Problem": "In a control system environment, the system state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the linear system dynamics \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) where D is a linear operator. An impulse response given by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another linear operator, is considered over time intervals.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a transformation \\\\( j(x) = Mx \\\\) where M is a linear operator is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(x) = Mx \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the trajectory of the system state post-intervention. Therefore, the state at \\\\( T \\\\) will depend not only on D but also significantly on the characteristics of M, influencing how the state evolves from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
