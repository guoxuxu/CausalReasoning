  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Nt} z \\\\, dt \\\\), with N also being a constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time T.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and this new state is then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to the state obtained by evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) directly to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will change the initial conditions. The integral transformation modifies the initial vector by integrating over a path influenced by \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\). This change in initial conditions results in a trajectory different from that of evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation h(z_0) to the initial state z_0 before evolving it under \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\) for time T results in a different state than evolving z_0 directly under \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\) for the same duration."
