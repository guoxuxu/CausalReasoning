  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\), where A and B are constant scalars. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} ds \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nBy observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), you cannot uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The non-linear nature of the differential equation and the potential modification by the integral operator prevent reverse deducing the original state uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
