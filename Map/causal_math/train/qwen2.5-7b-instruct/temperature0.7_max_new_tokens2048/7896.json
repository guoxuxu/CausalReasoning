  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iCs}z(s) ds \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nKnowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine specifically whether either transformation \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\), or both, were applied during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\), while solely determined by the differential equation in a simple scenario, fails to provide conclusive information about intermediate transformations like \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\). Each transformation impacts \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s evolution in a non-exclusive manner, allowing for potential overlap and thus ambiguity in backward determination.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t \\) influences the integral transformation \\( T(z) \\), which in turn determines \\( z(T) \\). The constant \\( C \\) dictates the rate of change of \\( z(t) \\), and knowing \\( z(T) \\) does not uniquely determine whether transformations \\( T \\) or \\( U \\) were applied."
