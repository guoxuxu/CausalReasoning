  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is used. We explore the properties as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoes transformations along the real and imaginary axes respectively in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + bi \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers.\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a transformed point \\\\( z' = h(z_0) \\\\), can one deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unambiguously?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-invertibility and non-linearity in the transformation and exponential function, multiple different complex numbers could yield the same output under \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Without exact information about the transformation parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
