  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. The Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is applied to f, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven an observed transformed function value at a point on the complex domain, is it possible to precisely identify the specific transformations and their sequences (whether B, C, or both) from just this value?",
  "Explanation": "The superposition and convolution effects in the transformations involving B and C can produce similar outcomes from different paths or orderings of interventions. Hence, just the endpoint does not uniquely determine the historical sequence or specific matrices used in the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation B applied to g(t) influences the form of the function, A determines the nature of f(z), and the Laplace transform of g(t) affects the transformed_function."
