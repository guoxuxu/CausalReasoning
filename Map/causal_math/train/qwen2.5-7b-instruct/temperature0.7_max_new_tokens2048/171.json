  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{Y(s)}{s - P} \\\\), where \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of the output variable y(t) and P is a constant pole. An input function is defined as \\\\( u(t) = e^{Dt} \\\\) where D is a constant. The system's response is altered by applying the Laplace transform of the input.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different input function \\\\( v(t) = e^{Et} \\\\) (where E is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the system's response \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at any future time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\), not influenced by \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( E \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another variable \\\\( E \\\\) altering the system's dynamics. The output Laplace transform will thus depend on all three constants \\\\( P, D, \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\), and not just on \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) because of the cumulative effect of both input functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
