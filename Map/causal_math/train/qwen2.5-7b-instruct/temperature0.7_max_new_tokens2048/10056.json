  "Problem": "Examine a system where electric potential V is described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) within a region and manipulate the boundary conditions to observe causal effects. We're especially interested in how transformations such as conformal mappings can infer changes in electric field distributions.\n\nGiven the distribution of \\\\(V\\\\) in a domain after a conformal mapping and introduction of an external field, can we conclusively trace back to identify the type of conformal mapping and original boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific conformal mapping and the original boundary conditions just from the final potential configuration is challenging. Multiple configurations and mappings can lead to similar potential distributions, especially when external fields introduce additional variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "V → E; conformal_mapping → V_transformed; external_field → V_final; V_transformed → V_final; original_boundary_conditions → V",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Electric potential V is influenced by original boundary conditions and can be transformed by conformal mappings. The introduction of an external field affects the final electric potential V_final. Conformal mappings and external fields cause changes in V which can be traced back to determine the original conditions."
