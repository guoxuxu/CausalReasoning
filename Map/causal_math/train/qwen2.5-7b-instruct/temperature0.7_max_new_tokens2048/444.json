  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) and then studying its behavior under this transformation.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the Fourier transform, the application of \\\\( M \\\\), or both) only from knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions used solely from the endpoint in the transformed state is not feasible because the operations in the frequency domain can produce complex interactions that are not distinguishable just based on the endpoint. Multiple combinations of initial conditions and interventions could lead to the same final state, creating ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to u results in F(u), which then behaves under the operator L to produce ˆu(k,T). Applying the Fourier transform to M results in F(M), which also behaves under L to produce ˆM(k,T). Knowing ˆu(k,T) alone does not allow us to determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the Fourier transform on u, the application of M, or both)."
