  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\), where D is a linear differential operator. Investigate the influence of a transformation characterised by \\\\( h(z) = z^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\) on the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where k is a non-zero scalar and C is a constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = X, can we determine the precise initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The unknown application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces ambiguity in back-calculating to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could significantly alter the original condition, and without this knowledge, it's impossible to accurately trace back.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to x (Dz) directly causes changes in z over x (z'). The transformation h(z) directly causes a modified form of z (z^k e^(Ct)). Knowing z at x=X does not uniquely determine the initial condition z_0 without information about the application of h(z)."
