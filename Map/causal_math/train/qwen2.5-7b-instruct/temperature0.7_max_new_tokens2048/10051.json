  "Problem": "In a study of fluid dynamics, let \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid on a plane, subject to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\). We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nIf an additional damping term, introduced at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affects the solution, will the Fourier transform of the solution at \\\\( t = T \\\\) still correspond to the evolution described by the initial PDE without the damping term?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping term (e.g., \\\\( -\\\\gamma u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a damping coefficient) modifies the dynamics of the fluid flow. As a result, the Fourier transform of the final state will incorporate effects of this damping, deviating from the original undamped evolved state.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The velocity field u(x,t) influences its temporal and spatial derivatives (∂u/∂t, ∂u/∂x), which together satisfy the given PDE. The Fourier transform F(u)(k,t) of u(x,t) evolves according to the initial PDE until t=t_1, when a damping term modifies ∂u/∂t, altering the solution's behavior after this point. At final time T, the Fourier transform F(u)(k,T) reflects the solution's state under the influence of the damping term if it has been active since t_1."
