  "Problem": "Consider a scenario wherein we have a Hilbert space and a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined on this space. The function \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied to any function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) in the space, and then the operator operates on \\\\( h(f(x)) \\\\). Furthermore, we consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and check how applying this transform affects the linear operation.\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( L(h(f(x))) \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without knowing whether the square was taken before or after applying \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the order of operations (whether the function was squared before or after applying \\\\( L \\\\)), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( f(x) \\\\) because squaring and the operator \\\\( L \\\\) can alter the function in fundamentally different ways that are irreversible and non-interchangeable.",
