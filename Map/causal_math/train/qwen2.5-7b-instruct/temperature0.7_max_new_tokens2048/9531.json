  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\theta(t)}\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant radial distance and \\\\(\\\\theta(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent angle. We explore the transformation under the matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) & \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) representing a rotation by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using a different rotation matrix \\\\( N(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\beta t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) & \\\\cos(\\\\beta t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) is applied, will the end position at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be dependent only on the original function and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions shift the angle not only by the original rotation \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) but also by the secondary rotation \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), impacting the final state considerably. Hence, the output depends on both angles, affecting the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention at time t_1 using matrix N(t) changes the angle θ(t), which then affects the position z(t) through time t. The original function's radial distance R remains constant, while ω and β influence θ(t) independently but do not directly affect z(t) once θ(t) is determined."
