  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial complex amplitude and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore causal relations incorporating the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + ce^{i\\delta t} \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) being a complex constant and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) a frequency.\n\nIf an intervention involving a second transformation \\\\( h(z) = z \\cdot de^{i\\eta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( \\eta \\\\) another frequency) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's behavior at any T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) from the original transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the original transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) are superimposed, and both contribute to the final state at time T. The multiplication of exponential terms involving different frequencies leads to a complex interaction pattern between \\\\( \\omega, \\delta, \\\\) and \\\\( \\eta \\\\) which affects the system's evolution and outcome significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex amplitude x and angular frequency ω determine z. The complex constant c and frequency δ affect g, which then influences z. Similarly, the complex constant d and frequency η affect h, which also influences z. Therefore, the system's behavior after applying the transformation h at time t_1 depends on both the original transformation parameters c and δ, as well as the new transformation parameters d and η."
