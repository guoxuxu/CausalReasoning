  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{z} \\) acting over the complex plane, where transformations are applied via complex integral transformations such as the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\). The system explores changes in the complex function domain and their propagation through the transformation.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\) of the function \\( e^z \\), can we reconstruct the original function \\( f(z) \\) across the entire complex plane without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, by its nature, limits its focus to specific aspects of \\( f(z) \\) (typically along the real axis), and does not retain all the information about the behavior of the function for all complex values of z. Additional complex extensions or other integral transformations may be required.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(z) is transformed into its Laplace transform L{f(z)}, and this transformation allows for the potential reconstruction of f(z) if certain conditions are met."
