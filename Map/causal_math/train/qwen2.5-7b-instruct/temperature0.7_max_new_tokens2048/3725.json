  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a functional relationship between input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The equation governing the system is \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nIf the voltage function \\\\( V(s) \\\\) is altered by a scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at s = S be proportionally scaled by \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linear nature of the Laplace transform ensures that scaling the input voltage by \\\\( k \\\\) directly scales the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) by the same factor. The system's response being directly proportional to the input is a fundamental property of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
