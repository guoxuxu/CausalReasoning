  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\), represented by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\), can we unequivocally determine the initial complex number \\( z_0 \\) without any knowledge about the transformations applied, such as the effect of \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform provides the frequency representation without clear information on the phase or amplitude associated with the initial complex number \\( z_0 \\). Without additional information or constraints, different \\( z_0 \\) could produce similar transforms depending on their amplitude and phase relationships.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω influences the time-dependent behavior of z(t), which in turn determines the Fourier transform F{z(t)}(s). The initial complex number z_0 sets the initial state of z(t), which also affects the Fourier transform F{z(t)}(s)."
