  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant. Analyses concern how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant, affect the function's behavior over iterations.\n\nGiven the trajectory information at some iteration \\\\( t \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), based solely on the observed iteration outcomes?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of complex plane rotations and their influence on the function iterations, multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) with different intervening points might result in similar or indistinguishable iteration trajectories. Therefore, it is not possible to uniquely determine the interventions from endpoint data alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
