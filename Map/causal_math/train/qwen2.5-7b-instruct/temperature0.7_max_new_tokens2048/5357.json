  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input that can be transformed using an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{F(s)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of a new input function. We study how transformations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) affect the system's behavior.\n\nIf a transformed control input \\\\( u'(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{G(s)\\\\} \\\\) is set at t = 0 such that \\\\( G(s) \\\\neq F(s) \\\\), and then the system is left to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu' \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at some future time t = T be the same as if original control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of the input changes the control function applied to the system, affecting the entire trajectory from the initial state. Since \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) differs from \\\\( u(t) \\\\), even if both are bounded and stable, they lead to different state responses due to the properties of the system dynamics described by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A transformed control input u'(t) influences the state x(t) differently than the original control input u(t), given the same system dynamics described by A and B. The Laplace transforms F(s) and G(s) represent different control inputs, leading to distinct state evolutions."
