  "Problem": "Consider a function z defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are interested in how the Fourier Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), affects this function.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention modifies z(t) to \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + e^{ivt} \\\\), where v isn’t necessarily equal to w, will the Fourier Transform at time T> t_1 only reflect the original frequency w?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( e^{ivt} \\\\) adds a new frequency component to the function. Consequently, the Fourier Transform at any time T > t_1 will reveal both frequencies w and v. The spectrum will contain delta functions at both these frequencies, not just at w.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original frequency w directly influences the function z(t), while the intervention involving frequency v directly changes z(t) to z'(t). The Fourier Transform F reflects the frequency components of its input; thus, F[z(t)] includes w and F[z'(t)] includes both w and v."
