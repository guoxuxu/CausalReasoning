  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied where s is a complex number.\n\nIf we apply the transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then let the system evolve according to the given differential equations, will \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time t = T still provide the same transformational output as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved directly without the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\) fundamentally captures an integral representation over time, changing the perspective of how the state evolves. The subsequent behavior under the differential equations is not incorporated in the transform taken at an initial time, hence the output will be different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transform T(z) applied to z(t) at time t=0 influences the initial condition of x(t) and y(t), which then evolve according to the differential equations determined by A, B, C, and D. Consequently, T(z) at time t=T provides a transformed version of z(t) that reflects the evolution of x(t) and y(t) from their transformed initial conditions."
