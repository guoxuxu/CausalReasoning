  "Problem": "Analyze the implications of applying a Fourier transform to a signal and then filtering with a kernel represented by H(s), an analytic function in the complex frequency domain, on the properties of the signal.\n\nIf a signal is Fourier transformed, multiplied by the filter H(s), and then inverse Fourier transformed, will the resulting time-domain function exhibit altered characteristics compared to the original signal?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform followed by multiplication with H(s) changes the frequency components of the signal based on H(s)'s properties. This manipulation typically alters the signal's time-domain characteristics, such as amplitude, phase, and bandwidth, based on H(s)'s functional form.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transform to a signal converts it to the frequency domain, where multiplying by an analytic function H(s) filters the signal, and an inverse Fourier transform returns the filtered signal to the time domain. The resulting time-domain function may exhibit altered characteristics compared to the original signal due to the filtering process."
