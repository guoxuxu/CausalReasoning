  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. This function models a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane over time t. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function and then examining the implications of manipulations in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the Fourier transform, can we infer that the original function was specifically \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) suggests a sinusoidal component at this frequency, the original function could be a combination of multiple sinusoids or other functions contributing to the same frequency component, without specific amplitude or phase information.",
