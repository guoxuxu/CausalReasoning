  "Problem": "Assume a differential equation governing the temperature \\\\( T \\\\) of a body over time is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant and \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature. Now consider a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + h \\\\) applied at some initial time, where \\\\( h \\\\) represents a heating intervention.\n\nHaving the knowledge of the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t \\\\), is it possible to definitively conclude whether the transformation \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without further data?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( T(t) \\\\) does not disclose whether the initial temperature was originally \\\\( T(0) \\\\) or \\\\( T(0) + h \\\\). The information about whether an intervention occurred is lost as the exponential decay smoothens out initial differences over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature T influences the rate of change of temperature dT/dt, which is also influenced by the environmental temperature T_env and the constant k. Applying the transformation f(T) = T + h at t=0 increases T but does not provide direct evidence of this action solely based on T(t) without additional data."
