  "Problem": "Analyze a complex electrical circuit involving resistors (R), capacitors (C), and inductors (L), modeled by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int I dt\\\\), where V is voltage, I is current, t is time, and R, L, C are constants. Consider the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\\\\), applied to V(t).\n\nIf the initial state of current I(0) is zero and the circuit is subjected to a voltage V0 from t = 0, resulting in a Laplace transform of \\\\(V(s)\\\\), will this transform directly determine the Laplace transform of current \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{I(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) without any additional intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given V0 and the circuit dynamics described by the differential equation, the Laplace transform of V(t) adequately constrains the transform of I(t), as these elements are linearly dependent. The Laplace transform converts the differential equation into an algebraic equation, directly linking V(s) and I(s).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage V(t) and its Laplace transform V(s) are directly related through the Laplace transform definition. The resistance R, inductance L, capacitance C, initial current I(0), and voltage V0 all influence V(t) and consequently V(s). The Laplace transform of the current I(t) is I(s), which is determined by V(s), R, L, C, and I(0)."
