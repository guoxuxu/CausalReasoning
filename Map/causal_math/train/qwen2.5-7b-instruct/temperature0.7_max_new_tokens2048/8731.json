  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\\\\\((z) = ze^{zt}\\\\\\\\) applied to a complex number \\\\\\\\((z = x + yi\\\\\\\\), where \\\\\\\\((x\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\((y\\\\\\\\) are constants and \\\\\\\\((t\\\\\\\\) represents time. The system's behavior is analyzed under an integral transformation \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\), defined as \\\\\\\\((Tf(z) = \\\\int_0^1 f(zu) du\\\\\\\\).\n\nSuppose an intervention by changing the function to \\\\\\\\((g(z) = z^2e^{zt}\\\\\\\\) is applied at \\\\\\\\((t_1\\\\\\\\). Will the outcome at t = T only depend on the original function \\\\\\\\((ze^{zt}\\\\\\\\) and not on the changed function \\\\\\\\((g(z)\\\\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function into a new form \\\\\\\\((z^2e^{zt}\\\\\\\\), which, when coupled with the transform \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\), will yield an outcome distinctly influenced by \\\\\\\\((g(z)\\\\\\\\)'s properties as well as the original function's properties. The end result at t = T will inherently depend on both functions' contributions under the integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
