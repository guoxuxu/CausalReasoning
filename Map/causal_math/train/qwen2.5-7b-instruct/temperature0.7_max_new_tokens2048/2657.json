  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Lz + \\eta(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) represents the influence of noise, which could be stochastic in nature. We explore the effect of introducing a control operation given by \\\\(g(z) = Dz\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nIf the system starts from an initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) and evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Lz + \\eta(t)\\\\) over a time period T without any intervention, will the system's state at time T be identically distributed as if \\\\(D\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the diagonal matrix \\\\(D\\\\) at t = 0 would affect the initial state, leading to different system dynamics due to the interaction between \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\). Also, the inherent stochasticity from \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) can result in diverging paths even from modified initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0, the linear operator L, and the noise η(t) directly cause the system's state z(T) at time T. The diagonal matrix D indirectly influences the system's state through the control operation g(z(T)), but this influence does not change the distribution of z(T) compared to the case without D."
