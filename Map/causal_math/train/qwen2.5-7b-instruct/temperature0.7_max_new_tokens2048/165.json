  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane over time t. Analyze the transformations applied by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and the implications of these transformations over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\\\) and the system is then evolved without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) traversing the same path as \\\\( z_0(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) modifies the initial point to \\\\( z_0^2 = 1 \\\\), maintaining the same point. However, the rate of traversal around the circle changes as \\\\( z(t)^2 = e^{2it} \\\\), resulting in a doubling of the angular velocity compared to the original system without transformation. This means the path traversed will be different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
