  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real frequency. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without clarity on whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied leaves ambiguity. The scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) could significantly alter \\\\( z_0 \\\\), making it impossible to retrieve the initial value uniquely.",
