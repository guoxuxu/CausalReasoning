  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in an electric field described by a vector function \\\\(E(x, t)\\\\). The velocity of the particle \\\\(v(t)\\\\) at time t is affected by this field through the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = qE(x(t), t)\\\\), where q is the charge of the particle and x(t) its position. We investigate the impact of the function \\\\(g(x, v, t) = e^{At}v + \\int_0^t K(t, s) x(s) ds\\\\), with A being a constant matrix and K(t, s) an integral kernel function.\n\nIf \\\\(g(x, v, t)\\\\) is applied to the initial conditions \\\\((x_0, v_0)\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the differential equation without further intervention, will the velocity \\\\(v(T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\((x_0, v_0)\\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = qE(x(t), t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(x, v, t)\\\\) initially alters the velocity and potentially the path, given the contribution from \\\\\\(v_0\\\\\\). The matrix exponential and integral parts of g modify the dynamics from the initial trajectory, resulting in a different state at T.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The electric field E(x(t), t) and the particle's position x(t) directly cause the particle's velocity v(t). The constants A and the integral kernel K(t, s) define the function g(x, v, t), which in turn influences the velocity v(T) at time T. Initial conditions x_0 and v_0 determine the value of g(x, v, t), and thus affect v(T)."
