  "Problem": "In a control system, consider a scalar linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p z \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is a constant parameter. The function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\sin(qz) \\\\) is applied, transforming the state, where \\\\( q \\\\) is another constant parameter.\n\nIf we intervene by applying a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = z^2 \\\\) at a time t1, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend exclusively on the parameter \\\\( p \\\\) and not on \\\\( q \\\\) or the details of the transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) = z^2 \\\\) adds a quadratic modification which, combined with the earlier sine transformation, alters the evolution in a complex way dependent on both the parameter \\\\( p \\\\) and the characteristics of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by \\\\( p \\\\), \\\\( q \\\\), and the form of both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on the parameter p and is influenced by the state at time t1, which in turn is affected by the parameters p and q through the transformations."
