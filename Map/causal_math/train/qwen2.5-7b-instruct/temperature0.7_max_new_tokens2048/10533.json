  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) satisfy the system of differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\). The system is subjected to a Fourier transform defined as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), where \\( Z(s) \\) is the transformed function in the complex s-domain.\n\nIf the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) are set, and the system evolves naturally under its differential constraints to \\( t = T \\), will \\( Z(s) \\) at \\( s = i\\omega \\) (Fourier transform at frequency \\( \\omega \\)) reflect only these initial conditions without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) influenced by their coupled differential equations affects \\( Z(s) \\) which encapsulates the entire frequency domain characteristics of \\( z(t) \\). The calculation of \\( Z(s) \\) includes integrations and transformations from both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), reflecting their intertwined dynamics, not just the initial conditions.",
