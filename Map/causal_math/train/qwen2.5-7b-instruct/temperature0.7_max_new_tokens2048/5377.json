  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(x, y) = \\\\int_{0}^{y} e^{At} x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent vector function. We assess how applying an operational matrix \\\\( H \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) when integrated to time \\\\( y \\\\).\n\nIf the operational matrix \\\\( H \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( x(t) \\\\), transforming it to \\\\( Hx(t) \\\\) before performing the integral transformation, does this affect the outcome of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) at the integration limit \\\\( y \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( H \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes the integrand from \\\\( e^{At} x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{At} Hx(t) \\\\), which influences the outcome of the integral. The transformation modifies the contributions of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) within the integral, thereby altering \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
