  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem where the velocity field of the fluid, represented by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,t) \\\\), is manipulated through transformations \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\nabla \\\\psi \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a scalar potential function varying with spatial coordinates and time. The fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations under incompressible flow conditions.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\) is initially applied to a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}_0 \\\\) and the system is subsequently allowed to evolve according to the Navier-Stokes equations without further manipulation, will the flow characteristics at any future time t = T be identical to those obtained by evolving \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}_0 \\\\) directly under the same conditions without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\psi \\\\) to the velocity field modifies the initial conditions and potentially introduces changes in flow characteristics such as vorticity, which affects the future evolution of the fluid according to the Navier-Stokes equations. The nonlinear nature of these equations means that small initial changes can lead to significantly different states over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(\\(\\mathbf{v}\\)) = \\(\\mathbf{v} + \\nabla \\psi\\) to \\(\\mathbf{v}_0\\) and then evolving it under the Navier-Stokes equations results in the same flow characteristics as directly evolving \\(\\mathbf{v}_0\\) under the same equations."
