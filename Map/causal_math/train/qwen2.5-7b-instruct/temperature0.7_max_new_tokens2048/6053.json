  "Problem": "Consider a system which can be modeled by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), shifting through complex numbers in a unit circle over time. An external transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = 1\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and the system is then left to evolve according to \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be on the unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) will scale the magnitude of \\\\(z_0\\\\) by \\\\(|c|\\\\). Unless \\\\(|c| = 1\\\\), the resultant trajectory will not stay on the unit circle, since \\\\(z(T) = c e^{iT}\\\\), and \\\\(|ce^{iT}| = |c|\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial position z(0) determines z(t) which evolves on the unit circle. The transformation c shifts z(0) to f(z) but does not affect its unit circle property. Therefore, z(T) remains on the unit circle."
