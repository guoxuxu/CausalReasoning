  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) is applied to \\( u(x, 0) \\) and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will \\( u(x, t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( u(x, 0) \\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform to \\( u(x, 0) \\) and its subsequent evolution under the heat equation simply represents a change of basis (from spatial domain to frequency domain). Since the heat equation and the Fourier transform are linear operations and the transformation is reversible, the evolved state \\( u(x, T) \\) will still correspond to directly evolving \\( u(x, 0) \\) to \\( u(x, T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition u(x, 0) and evolving it according to the heat equation leads to the same result as directly evolving u(x, 0) under the heat equation."
