  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform output, can we determine specifically which rotations (either \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-i\\\\phi} \\\\), or both) were applied to the initial complex number?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant Fourier transform output could potentially be a consequence of different combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) owing to the rotational symmetry. Different sets of rotations might result in the same final transformed output, rendering it ambiguous to infer the exact sequence or type of rotations applied without more detailed information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the complex function transformation z(w) = e^(iθ)w, where θ is a constant, directly rotates the complex number w in the complex plane, which then influences the Fourier transform F(w) = ∫[-∞, ∞] e^(-ixw) f(x) dx. The value of f(x) also affects F(w)."
