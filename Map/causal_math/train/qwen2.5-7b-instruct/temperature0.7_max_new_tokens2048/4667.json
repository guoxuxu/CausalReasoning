  "Problem": "Consider a physical scenario where heat propagation in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity. We analyze the system's response to a time-dependent boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional cooling is applied at the opposite end of the rod periodically represented by \\\\( u(L,t) = \\cos(\\mu t)\\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is the length of the rod and \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is a constant, will this intervention impact the heat distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced cooling condition will alter the heat distribution across the rod, influencing the overall thermal gradient and temperature profile at any time T > t_1. The effects combine both boundary conditions dynamically as per the governing heat equation.",
