  "Problem": "Consider the balance of a linear mechanical system with mass, spring, and damper. The governing differential equation is \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} + c\\\\dot{x} + kx = 0 \\\\), where m is mass, c is damping coefficient, k is spring constant, and x is displacement.\n\nIf an external force \\\\( F(t) = F_0 e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), would this intervention solely determine the displacement response of the system for any future time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), irrespective of the previous damping coefficient \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces an additional force, affecting the system's response. However, the overall displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will still depend on the mass, spring constant, previous damping coefficient, and earlier state of the system, not just on the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
