  "Problem": "A function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined in the complex plane and its evolution is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, and analyze its effects on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where \\\\( F \\\\) is a real constant) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on C and not be influenced by D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another dynamic element to the system, so that the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the exponential factors applied by both \\\\( D \\\\) at the initial and \\\\( F \\\\) at the intermediate stage. This results in a final state shaped by \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( F \\\\), reflecting composite effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
