  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a control system operates following a linear equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), with K being a constant coefficient matrix and u representing external control influences. Suppose an experimental transformation \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) is introduced, where A is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) from the state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) observed at time t, assuming no knowledge of whether transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) was applied at the beginning, it's impossible to uniquely determine the original state \\\\( y_0 \\\\). The transformation could have altered \\\\( y_0 \\\\), making different initial states map to the same observed output, particularly if A introduces changes that are not straightforwardly reversible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
