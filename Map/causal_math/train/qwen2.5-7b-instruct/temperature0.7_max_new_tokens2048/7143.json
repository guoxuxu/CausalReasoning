  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being real constants.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend exclusively on \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) and not on the initial parameters \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the dynamics from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, but the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is already significantly shaped by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Thus, the system's final state at T will reflect both the influence of original parameters up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the new dynamics post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The values of A and B determine the rates of change of x and y, while A' and B' determine the rates of change of x' and y' after time t_1. The system state z(T) depends on the cumulative effect of both sets of parameters up to time T."
