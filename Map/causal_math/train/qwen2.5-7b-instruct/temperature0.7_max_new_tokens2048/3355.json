  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where a and b are complex constants. We analyze how the mapping under this function and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\), where c and d are also complex constants, affect outcomes.\n\nIf an intervention of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing the evolution post-\\\\( f(z_0) \\\\), will the final state at time T depend only on parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) and not on \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces new parameters \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\) that alter the trajectory initiated by \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\). The resultant complex state at time T will depend on all four parameters, thus not solely on \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
