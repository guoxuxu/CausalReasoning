  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz + D\\\\), where C is a matrix and D is a vector constant. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Mz + N \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector, at an initial time t = 0.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence or types of initial and intermediate transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) used, solely from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the matrix C?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may be reached through various sequences of transformations due to the overlap in potential transformations and state trajectories. This ambiguity, combined with the linear nature of transformations and their effects on the system's evolution, makes it challenging to uniquely reverse-engineer the exact sequence or types of transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(t) evolves over time to become z(T) under the influence of the differential equation's dynamics (C → dz/dt), and this evolution can be transformed by h(z) at t=0, affecting the initial state."
