  "Problem": "Let us consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z' = i \\omega z\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function of time, \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\(T(z) = z e^{i \\theta t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is a constant real shift in frequency.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(S(z)\\\\), or none), only by knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could arise from multiple pathways including no transformation, one or both transformations occurring at different times or frequencies. This leads to multiple potential histories, making it impossible to deduce the exact sequence or presence of interventions solely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z' → z(T); ω → z'; θ → T(z); t → T(z); z → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z with respect to time (z') is caused by the frequency (ω). The transformation T(z) is caused by the shift in frequency (θ) and time (t). The value of z at time T (z(T)) depends on the initial value of z and the transformation T applied."
