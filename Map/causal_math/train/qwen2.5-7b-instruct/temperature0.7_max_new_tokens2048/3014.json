  "Problem": "Consider a time-varying complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We look at the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) as a delta function centred at some constant \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), can it be deduced that the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) without knowing the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function in \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) precisely indicates that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was a pure exponential function of the form \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\). This specific transformation feature allows exact determination of the cause from the effect in the domain of Fourier analysis of simple exponential signals.",
