  "Problem": "Imagine a physical system that can be modeled by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a region. Consider interventions performed using a boundary condition modification where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) on part of the boundary is altered using a function \\\\(h(t, x)\\\\), which is timedependent.\n\nIf an intervention is performed at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) by changing the boundary conditions to a new function \\\\(h(t_1, x)\\\\), will the final state \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) still be predicted solely based on the initial condition \\\\(h(0, x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the boundary conditions at \\\\(t_1\\\\), thereby altering the solution landscape beyond this point. The final state depends on both the original and the modified boundary conditions, requiring knowledge of \\\\(h(t_1, x)\\\\) along with \\\\(h(0, x)\\\\) to predict \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Interventions made through the boundary condition function h(t, x) at time t1 directly affect the potential φ(t, x) for all times t > t1; however, the initial condition h(0, x) also influences φ(t, x) for all times t."
