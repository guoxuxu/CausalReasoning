  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are also complex constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is used to transform a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the transformed value without further intervention, will \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\) be the same as \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the input to the function \\\\( f \\\\), changing its original input from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( cz_0 + d \\\\). Since the operations in \\\\( f \\\\) are non-linear (specifically the squaring function), the output will typically not be the same unless specific relationships between \\\\( a, b, c, \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) make them invariant under such transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z_0) precedes and influences the application of f, resulting in f(g(z_0)). This transformation changes the input for f, thus f(g(z_0)) is generally different from f(z_0)."
