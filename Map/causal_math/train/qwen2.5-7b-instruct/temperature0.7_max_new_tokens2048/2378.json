  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the function \\\\( p(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) represents the pressure at a point \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). The evolution of pressure is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 p \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Now, analyze the scenario under transformation given by the function \\\\( h(p) = e^{-kt} p \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nBy examining \\\\( p(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine the initial pressure \\\\( p_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if \\\\( h(p) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( e^{-kt} \\\\) modifies the initial state, lacking knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(p) \\\\), we cannot accurately back-calculate to the original state \\\\( p_0(x) \\\\). The decay factor introduced by \\\\( k \\\\) obscures the true initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial pressure p(x, 0) influences p(x, t) over time, which in turn influences p(x, T). The diffusion coefficient D governs the rate of change of pressure with respect to time. The function h(p) transforms p(x, T) based on time constant k, but knowing p(x, T) alone is insufficient to conclusively determine p(x, 0) without additional information."
