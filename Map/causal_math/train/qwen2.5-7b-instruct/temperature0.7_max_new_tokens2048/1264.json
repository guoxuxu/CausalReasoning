  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) shows two delta peaks, at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\), can we determine precisely when the switch from \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform reveals frequency components but lacks temporal resolution to pinpoint the exact time of frequency change. Multiple temporal distributions can lead to the same spectral signature, hence the timing of the change cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
