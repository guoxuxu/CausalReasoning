  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} e^{zt} dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the implication of perturbing the variable \\\\( z \\\\) through a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z + w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain intermediate stage \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to a new value \\\\( z' = z + u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex constant, does the final output of \\\\( F(z') \\\\) depend solely on the last change (from \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z+u \\\\) ) and not the initial transformation by \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations influence the final output; the adjustments to \\\\( z \\\\) accumulate effects due to the exponential component \\\\( e^{(z+u+w)t} \\\\). The dependency of the integral on exponential terms makes the output sensitive to all changes made to \\\\( z \\\\), not just the last transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
