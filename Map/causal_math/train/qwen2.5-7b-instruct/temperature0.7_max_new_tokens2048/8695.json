  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit (Resistor (R), Inductor (L), and Capacitor (C)) in series. The governing differential equation is \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = 0\\\\), describing the charge \\\\(q\\\\) on the capacitor over time. We are interested in the effects of applying a Laplace transform to this equation, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nIf a step voltage is applied as an external input to the RLC system, and then it is operated under the rules defined by the Laplace-transformed differential equation, does the solution \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) account for this intervention and correctly predict the new behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a step voltage and operating under the Laplace-transformed equations allows for the external input to be included as an additional term in the transformed equation. The Laplace transform method is capable of incorporating such changes, and when solved, the resulting \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) and its corresponding inverse transform will predict the new behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) accurately, taking into account both the original and the intervened system dynamics.",
