  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by changing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a different value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the subsequent Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) ignoring the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post intervention will contain components of both the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) due to the presence of both frequencies at different times in the signal. Thus, it reflects a combination rather than just the new frequency.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω influences z(t) before t1, while ω' influences z(t) after t1. Consequently, the Fourier transform F(z) for t > t1 reflects primarily the frequency ω' due to the change in z(t) influenced by ω'."
