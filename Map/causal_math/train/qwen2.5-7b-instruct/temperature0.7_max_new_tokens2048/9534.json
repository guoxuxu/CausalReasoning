  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real functions of time and governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, D as constants. Analyze the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)M}z(s)ds \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can it be determined definitively whether the transform \\\\( T \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T is not sufficient to uniquely infer if the transform \\\\( T \\\\) was applied because different initial conditions and system parameters (A, B, C, D, M) could potentially produce the same output at t = T without the use of the transform. Hence, knowing the effect alone doesn’t sufficiently reveal the specific cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transform T at t=0 influences the state of z(t) at any time t, and knowing z(t) at t=T provides information about the state of z at t=0 through the reverse process of the transform."
