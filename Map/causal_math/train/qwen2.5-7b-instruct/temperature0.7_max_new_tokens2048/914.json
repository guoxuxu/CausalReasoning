  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the effect of performing a Fourier transform on \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) denotes the Fourier transform and k represents the transformed spatial variable.\n\nGiven the observed transformed state \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) \\\\) at time t, can we uniquely determine the initial transformed state \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, 0) \\\\) without knowing the form of L?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge of L and thus \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\), it is impossible to work backwards uniquely from \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, 0) \\\\), as multiple different operators could yield similar transformed states over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
