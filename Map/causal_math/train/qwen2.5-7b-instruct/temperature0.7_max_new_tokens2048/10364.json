  "Problem": "Imagine a continuous system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) as a transformation that acts on the state variable u.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we specifically determine which transformations or interventions (\\\\( F(u) \\\\), \\\\( G(u) \\\\), or both) were used by only knowing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformations' effects on altering spectral properties and their potential interactions, different combinations of \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and \\\\( G(u) \\\\) could conceivably yield the same final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\). This overlap in effects creates ambiguity and prevents us from definitively identifying the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
