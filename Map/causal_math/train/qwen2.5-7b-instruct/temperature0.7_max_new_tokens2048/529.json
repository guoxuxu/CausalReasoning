  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = h(t) + g(t)i \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are real functions representing harmonic oscillations. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this complex function over time t.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) is computed at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve naturally over time, will the spectrum at time T reflect the initial conditions set by \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform provides the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0. As the system evolves, these components do not change in frequency, though their phases and amplitudes might oscillate. Thus, the spectrum at any time T will reflect the initial conditions.",
