  "Problem": "Examine a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. The transformation considered is through the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and the transformed function is let to solve the PDE, will the solution at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) in the physical space be identical to evolving \\\\(u_0\\\\) under the same PDE without applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The action of the Fourier transform on the initial condition changes the representation but not the inherent characteristics of the wave functions under the linear PDE. The inverse transform of the solution in the Fourier space will provide the same results as solving the PDE directly in the physical space.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0(x) directly influences the solution u(x,t) in physical space, while applying the Fourier transform F to u_0(x) results in a transformed solution u(k,t) in Fourier space. Evolving u(k,t) under the PDE leads to u(x,T) which, due to the properties of the Fourier transform and the linearity of the PDE, is equivalent to directly evolving u_0(x) under the same PDE."
