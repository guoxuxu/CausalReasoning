  "Problem": "Consider a function representing a complex variable transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency, and z is a complex variable. We are considering the evolution of this transformation over time t and its impact when combined with an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolves over time according to the integral transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) without further mathematical manipulation, will \\\\( G(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T have the same phase as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was processed directly by \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) essentially rotates the complex number z in the complex plane over time, changing its phase but not its magnitude. Given that \\\\( G(z) \\\\) integrates across time, integrating a rotationally altered complex number will accumulate changes in phase, resulting in a different effect compared to a direct application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) on the untransformed initial value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) = e^(iωt)z modifies z over time t, which is then integrated by G(z) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^(-st)z(t) dt to produce G(z(t)). This process changes the phase of z(t) over time compared to directly applying G(z) to the initial z_0 at time T."
