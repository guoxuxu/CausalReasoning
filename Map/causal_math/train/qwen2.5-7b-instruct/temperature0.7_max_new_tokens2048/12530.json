  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a real variable y depends on x through the relation \\(y = x^2 + 2x + 1\\). We study the transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) and examine its impact on y, in the context of solving the related differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 2 \\).\n\nIf at \\( x = 2 \\), we apply an intervention \\( h(x) = x - 1 \\) (transforming \\( x' = 1 \\)), will the resulting \\( y \\) at \\( x' = 1 \\) still be based solely on the initial function without considering the implications of \\( g(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening in the system by applying \\( h(x) = x - 1 \\) changes the trajectory and final outcome of y. Although \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\) uniquely determines y from x, any preceding transformations (like \\( g(x) \\)) or their absence are pertinent, as they set up the conditions under which \\( h(x) \\) modifies x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of y is determined by x through the equation y = x^2 + 2x + 1. An intervention h(x) = x - 1 transforms x to x', and when x = 2, x' becomes 1. The resulting y at x' = 1 is influenced directly by x's original value before the transformation."
