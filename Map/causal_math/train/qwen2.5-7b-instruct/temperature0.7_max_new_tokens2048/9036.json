  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) evolving in time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined as \\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex \\( s \\), is analyzed.\n\nIf we observe \\( T(z) \\) and know that either \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\beta \\) was influenced during \\( z(t) '\\)s evolution, can we determine exactly which frequencies and at what times the interventions happened solely from \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "As \\( T(z) \\) accumulates effects over the entire time span, different sequences or instances of interventions (altering \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\beta \\)) can correlate to indistinguishable results in \\( T(z) \\). Distinguishing precise frequencies and intervention timelines from \\( T(z) \\) alone is typically infeasible without additional time-specific data.",
