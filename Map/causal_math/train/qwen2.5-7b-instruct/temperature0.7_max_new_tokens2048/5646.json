  "Problem": "Consider an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = -ky(t) + \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\lambda (t-s)} y(s) ds \\\\), where k and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. This models a system where the rate of change of \\\\( y \\\\) depends on both its current state and a weighted integral of its history.\n\nKnowing the function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a specific time t, can we determine the initial value \\\\( y(0) \\\\) without knowledge of the full history from 0 to t?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at any time t depends on the entire history from 0 to t due to the integral part of the equation. Therefore, without knowledge of the function values between 0 and t, the initial value \\\\( y(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
