  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) and let \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform over the spatial variables, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t) \\), on the solution's behavior.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system by adding a function \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), such that the new initial condition at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is \\\\( u(x,t_1) + v(x,t_1) \\\\), and then the system evolves, will the heat equation's dynamics from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T depend solely on \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the initial condition and thus affects the system's subsequent evolution. The introduced function \\\\( v \\\\) adjusts the state variables, leading the future states to depend on both the original and the intervened conditions. Therefore, dynamics from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T will reflect inputs from both \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0(x) influences the solution u(x,t) up to time t_1. Introducing v(x,t) at t_1 changes the solution to u(x,t_1) + v(x,t_1), which then evolves according to the heat equation. The dynamics from t_1 to T depend on both u_0(x) and v(x,t)."
