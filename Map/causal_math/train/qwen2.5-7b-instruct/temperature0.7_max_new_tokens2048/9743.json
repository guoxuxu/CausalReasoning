  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are complex numbers. We study the changes in the integral along a path in the complex plane, comparing before and after a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nSuppose a predefined intervention adjusts the function to \\\\( h(z) = (z - d)^2 + pz + q \\\\) at a mid-point of the path, does the integral from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) solely depend on the original function's parameters \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\), ignoring the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function's form during the path of integration, hence altering contributions to the integral from the segment where the intervention is applied. This results in a dependency on the parameter \\\\( d \\\\) in addition to \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\), changing the outcome of the integral.",
