  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\), where R is also a constant, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely specify which interventions were taken (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), simply based on knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Diverse intervention sequences and types could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the exponential transformations influencing the outputs in non-linear and non-unique ways. The overlapping effects and non-reversible transformations make it challenging to determine the exact nature and order of interventions used during the process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "P and Q determine the rate of change of z with respect to t; R defines the transformation applied to z; this transformation influences z(t) over time; knowing z(T) does not uniquely specify the interventions taken since multiple combinations of transformations could result in the same z(T)."
