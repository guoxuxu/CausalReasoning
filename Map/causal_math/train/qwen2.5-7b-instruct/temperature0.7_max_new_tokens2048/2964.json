  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the temperature distribution over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the influence of a spatial transformation given by \\\\(g(x) = ax+b\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants, on this temperature distribution.\n\nGiven the temperature profile observed at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we exactly identify the type and parameters of the spatial transformations (\\\\(g(x)\\\\) or \\\\(h(x)\\\\) or both), applied at times \\\\(0\\\\) and \\\\(t_1\\\\) respectively?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and their parameters can result in the same final temperature distribution due to the diffusive nature of heat. The interplay between different transformations makes it impossible to pinpoint the exact interventions used.",
