  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) with a boundary condition u(0) = 0. Analyze its behavior under the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = u(x) e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) and knowing interventions occurred, can we uniquely determine whether the modification was due to a change in boundary conditions or the exponential transformation parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect seen in \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) stems from multiple factors, including potential changes in boundary conditions and the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). These factors are interdependent and can yield similar outcomes, thus it's challenging to discern the exact nature of interventions solely based on the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x) directly influences v(x, t) through the transformation v(x, t) = u(x) e^(-ωt), and the parameter ω directly influences v(x, t) through the same transformation."
