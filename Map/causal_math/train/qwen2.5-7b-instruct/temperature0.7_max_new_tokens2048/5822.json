  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{tA}x\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix with complex eigenvalues and \\\\(x\\\\) is an initial complex vector. We investigate the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), assuming no additional transformations have been applied besides the initial \\\\(T(z)\\\\), can we accurately retrieve \\\\(x\\\\), the initial vector before \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\(U\\\\), being unitary, has the property \\\\(U^{-1} = U^{*}\\\\) (the conjugate transpose), and it is always invertible, we can retrieve the initial state \\\\(x\\\\) from \\\\(z_0 = Ux\\\\) using \\\\(x = U^{*}z_0\\\\). Analysts must, however, be aware that these are the original conditions prior to the application of any transformation.",
