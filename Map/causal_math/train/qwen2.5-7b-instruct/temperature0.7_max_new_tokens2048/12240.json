  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the electric potential \\\\( V \\\\) in a region is governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 V = 0 \\\\). An external operator manipulates the boundary conditions or introduces additional charge densities \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\), which changes the solutions of the equation.\n\nIf an initial function \\\\( \\\\rho(y) \\\\) representing charge density is applied to the system without further input, will changing the boundary conditions alone spontaneously affect the distribution of the electric potential \\\\( V \\\\) within the system at later times?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the boundary conditions changes the constraints of the Laplace equation, directly impacting the distribution of the potential \\\\( V \\\\) throughout the space, even without additional interventions in the charge density. Boundary conditions are critical in determining solutions to Laplace's equation, hence they causally influence the potential distribution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
