  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature (T) at any spatial point (x,y) in a region follows the heat equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We study the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the temperature distribution, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), and analyze its influence over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed temperature distribution \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial temperature distribution at t = 0 without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier Transform was applied, reconstructing the original spatial temperature distribution T from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)(t)\\\\) is uncertain. The transformation might encode the frequencies differently, obscuring the real starting conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature T at any spatial point x,y changes over time t due to thermal diffusivity α, and the Fourier transform of the temperature distribution F(T) at time t is related to the temperature distribution T at that same time. Applying the Fourier transform does not directly provide information about the initial temperature distribution at t=0 without additional information."
