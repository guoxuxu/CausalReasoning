  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is the temperature at a point \\\\((x, y)\\\\). We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions, defined by the function \\\\(g(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(x, y)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) describes initial temperature distribution along the boundary.\n\nIf the Fourier transformed boundary condition \\\\(g(s)\\\\) is set at t = 0 and the system evolves under the Laplace equation without further intervention, does the steady-state solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) depend on the form of \\\\(g(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial boundary condition, transformed via Fourier, directly shapes the solution of the Laplace equation. The Fourier components in \\\\(g(s)\\\\) determine how heat diffuses through the domain, influencing the steady-state distribution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
