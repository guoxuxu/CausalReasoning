  "Problem": "Assume a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform operation, \\\\(F[\\\\cdot]\\\\), applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf a Laplace transform is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\) affecting z such that a new function \\\\(w(t)\\\\) is introduced and allowed to evolve under the same differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), will the endpoint Fourier transform \\\\(F[w(T)]\\\\) where T > t_1, be solely influenced by the initial dynamics up to \\\\(t_1\\\\) and not by the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform as an intervention changes the form of the function \\\\(w(t)\\\\) dramatically, generally introducing new components in both frequency and time-domain representation. This alteration significantly affects the resultant function at any time T > t_1, making \\\\(F[w(T)]\\\\) dependent on both the initial dynamics and the character of the Laplace intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w(t) at any time t is directly influenced by z(t) at times less than or equal to t. Applying a Laplace transform at t_1 introduces a new function w(t) which evolves according to the same differential equation as z(t). The Fourier transform F[w(T)] at T > t_1 is influenced by the state of w(t) from t_1 onwards, including the effect of the Laplace transform intervention."
