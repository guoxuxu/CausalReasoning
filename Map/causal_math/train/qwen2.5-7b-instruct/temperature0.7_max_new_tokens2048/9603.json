  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a partial differential equation shown by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analyze the scenario where a transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is performed, with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) representing the Fourier transform.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( j(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(u) \\\\) (inverse Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(u) \\\\) as an inverse Fourier Transform reverses the earlier transformation but modifies the path of evolution subsequently. The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will reflect the history of these transformations and is determined by how transformations and L interact over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of u at time T depends on the operator L and the initial condition u(t1), but not on the transformations h or j applied at different times."
