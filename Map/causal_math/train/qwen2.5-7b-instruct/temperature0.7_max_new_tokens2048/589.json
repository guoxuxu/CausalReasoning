  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\).\n\nIf function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially given and then transformed by the Laplace transform without further intervention, does the result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) depend solely on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is directly derived from the exponential function and depends uniquely on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\), reflecting the intrinsic characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter w directly influences Z(s) through z(t), and z(t) transformation by the Laplace transform leads to Z(s) which depends solely on w."
