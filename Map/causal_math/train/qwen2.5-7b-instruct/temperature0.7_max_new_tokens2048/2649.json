  "Problem": "Consider a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t)\\\\) where A is a matrix governing the system dynamics. The impact of a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{Ct}x(t)\\\\), where C is also a matrix, on this system is examined. The ODE system is studied under typical operation and after application of a transformation.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t=0 and then the system is left to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t)\\\\) with no further interventions, will the state of the system \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t=T be identical to the evolution of \\\\(x_0\\\\) directly under the system's ODE to t=T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{Ct}x(t)\\\\) initially modifies the state, thus changing the trajectory from what would have occurred just under A. The presence of C introduces a different evolutionary pathway for the state, dependent on both A and the transformation matrix C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(x) modifies the initial state x_0, which then evolves according to the system dynamics governed by A. The matrix C determines how T(x) transforms x_0 before it starts evolving under A."
