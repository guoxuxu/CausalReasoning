  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are complex constants. We evaluate the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z + S \\\\), where R and S are also complex constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining interventions solely based on the endpoint is highly ambiguous due to the potential overlap in transformations impacted by R, S, U, V, and their interaction over the complex plane. Multiple combinations of parameters and interventions might lead to the same endpoint, creating inherent uncertainty in backtracking the exact transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "P → dz/dt; Q → dz/dt; R → g(z); S → g(z); z(0) → z(t); T → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "P and Q determine the rate of change of z with respect to t; R and S define the transformation g(z); z(0) influences z(t) over time; T determines the endpoint z(T); knowing z(T) alone is insufficient to precisely determine the interventions used."
