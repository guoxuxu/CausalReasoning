  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The system is subject to the operation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) followed by an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification \\\\( g(z) = e^{zt} \\\\) is introduced, will the final Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) \\\\) be solely dependent on the initial function shape without considering the effects of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{zt} \\\\) introduces a significant exponential factor influencing both the growth rate and the oscillation pattern of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This change alters the original function's behavior substantially, thus affecting the resultant transform. Consequently, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) \\\\) reflects the influence of both the initial function shape and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of g(z) modifies z(t), which then undergoes the operation f(z) resulting in z^2. This z^2 is subsequently transformed by T to produce T[z](s). Thus, the final Laplace transform T[z](s) depends on the initial modifications through z(t) and the operations applied."
