  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function on the real-time series data modeled by \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real diagonal matrix. We analyze the scenario where the function \\\\( f(x) = (C*x)^2 \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being another real matrix, is applied to the series.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can one deduce the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) given that \\\\( f(x) \\\\) might have been applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The initial conditions could have been non-uniquely modified by \\\\( (C*x_0)^2 \\\\), making it impossible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of whether or how \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied, especially since squaring and matrix multiplication can obscure or lose original value information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x_0 directly influences x(t) through the equation x(t) = e^(At)x_0. The matrix C directly influences f(x) through the equation f(x) = (C*x)^2. Knowing x(T) and the matrices A and C, one can trace back to deduce x_0 without additional information."
