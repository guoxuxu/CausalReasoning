  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}x\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex square matrix, and \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex initial vector. We explore transformations with the operation \\\\(f(z) = Cz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is observed over time, and the consequences of an intervention through function \\\\(f\\\\) are analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\(z_0 = x\\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}z_0\\\\) without any operation \\\\(f\\\\), then kept evolving according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\), will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be influenced by the matrix \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the application of the function \\\\(f(z) = Cz\\\\), the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is solely determined by the matrix exponential \\\\(e^{At}\\\\), and hence only depends on the matrix \\\\(A\\\\). The matrix \\\\(C\\\\) does not influence the trajectory or final value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) in this scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix A influences z(t) directly, x serves as the initial state for z(t), and C influences f(z) which transforms z(t). Consequently, z(T) at time T is not directly influenced by C but indirectly via f(z)."
