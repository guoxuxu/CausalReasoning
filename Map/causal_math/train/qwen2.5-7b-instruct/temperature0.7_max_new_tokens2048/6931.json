  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region undergoing a heat transfer process modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T + S(x,y,z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(T\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term depending on position and time. An intervention is introduced by applying a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(T) = T + \\\\gamma e^{-\\\\delta t} \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) are constants) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), or \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(T) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the heat distribution, superimposing another exponentially decaying term. The final state \\\\( T(T) \\\\) thus depends on the interplay between both transformations as well as the original heat equation parameters, resulting in an endpoint influenced by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\), alongside \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint T(T) for T > t_1 depends on S(x,y,z,t), κ, α, β, γ, and δ through the transformations f(T) and g(T), but simplifying under the assumption that the effects of α, β, γ, and δ diminish over time, the primary influence on T(T) beyond t_1 is expected to be from S(x,y,z,t) and κ."
