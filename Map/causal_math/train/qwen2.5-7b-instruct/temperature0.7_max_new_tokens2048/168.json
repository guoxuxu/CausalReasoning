  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane over time t. Analyze the transformations applied by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and the implications of these transformations over time.\n\nGiven the observed final state \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) or the intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) was applied, assuming starting at \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed final state \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) corresponds to various possible transformations and interventions. Both the squaring and cubing of the angle in complex exponentials can be formatted over different durations to result in the same final state observed, making it impossible to uniquely determine which transformation was used solely based on the observed endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Starting from z(0) = e^(i0), z(t) represents the evolution of z over time t, leading to z(T) = e^(iT). Applying f(z) = z^2 transforms z into z^2, while applying g(z) = z^3 transforms z into z^3. Given z(T) = e^(iT), it is not possible to uniquely determine whether f(z) or g(z) was applied."
