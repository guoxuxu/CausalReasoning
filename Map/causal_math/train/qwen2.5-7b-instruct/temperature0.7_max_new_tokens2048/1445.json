  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing a physical system. We utilize a Fourier Transform to analyze frequency components, defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(t) \\\\) has a certain frequency spectrum determined by \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), and then is allowed to evolve naturally according to its physical laws without further intervention, will the Fourier Transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) include new frequency components?",
  "Explanation": "If the system evolves naturally without external input or changes, the frequency components determined at any later time will remain consistent with the initial intrinsic frequencies set by \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) unless there are internal nonlinearities or additional forces influencing the system.",
