  "Problem": "Assume the behavior of a complex system can be modeled by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\), where \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state in complex space, and A and C are constant complex matrices. Manipulations on the system are achieved by applying the transformation \\\\(h(z) = Dze^{Bt}\\\\), where D and B are also constant complex matrices.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can one infer the exact initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied, it's ambiguous if the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\) comes from \\\\(Ce^{AT}z_0\\\\) or \\\\(Ce^{AT}(Dz_0)\\\\). Disentangling the effect of D from the evolution due to A and C is non-trivial without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(T) at time T is influenced by the initial state z_0, and the transformation h(z) applied at t = 0 influences the state z(T). Without knowing if h(z) was applied at t = 0, it is not possible to infer the exact initial state z_0 from z(T) alone."
