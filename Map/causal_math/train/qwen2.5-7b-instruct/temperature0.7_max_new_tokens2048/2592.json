  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where L is a linear operator and z_0 is an initial complex number. We explore the behavior involving an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Kt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where K is another linear operator.\n\nCan the exact sequence of operations (application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) and the operators used (L, K, M) be specifically determined just by the observed output of these processes on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in the effects of different operators through exponential functions and integration makes it challenging to deduce uniquely the sequence or nature of operations applied. Given the complexity and potential non-commutative properties of exponential operator actions, multiple operation sequences might yield the same endpoint, creating ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z_0 → z(t); L → z(t); K → f(z); T → z(T); f(z) → output; g(z) → output",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z_0 directly causes z(t). The linear operator L directly causes z(t). The linear operator K directly causes f(z). The time T directly causes z(T). The function f(z) directly causes the output. No causal relationship is established between g(z) and the output based on the given information."
