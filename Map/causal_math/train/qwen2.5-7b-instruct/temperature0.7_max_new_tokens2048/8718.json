  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices, and x is the initial condition. We examine the effects of an input transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we precisely deduce the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) from the system output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) (specifically the matrix D) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original vector x from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) since both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( Dx \\\\) could potentially lead to the same or different outputs depending on the properties of D relative to C and A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
