  "Problem": "Consider a system where temperature distribution over a rod is described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a diffusion constant. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, T)) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without context on whether the Fourier transform was applied at t = 0, it's impossible to reconstruct the original spatial temperature profile uniquely from the transformed data, as the Fourier transform significantly alters the information content and how it evolves.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u(x, t) changes over time due to spatial diffusion, and the Fourier transform F(u(x, T)) of the temperature distribution at time T can be used to infer the initial temperature distribution u(x, 0) if the diffusion process is known."
