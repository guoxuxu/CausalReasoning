  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nFrom measurement of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially, can we uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with certainty?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is unknown, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could either be \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{kT}e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\) and without further information, the phase factor introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) obscures the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely is therefore not possible.",
