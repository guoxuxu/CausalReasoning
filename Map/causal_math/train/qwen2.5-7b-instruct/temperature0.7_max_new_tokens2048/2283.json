  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We explore the effects on the function after applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation \\\\( U(z) = z e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) as another complex constant, is applied at time t_1 > 0, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the initial differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( U(z) \\\\) at time t_1 introduces an additional modifying factor, \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), affecting the evolution of the state from t_1 to T. Thus, the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) are influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), leading to a composition of effects which are not solely attributable to the original equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time depends on the differential equation z'(t) = iωz(t), while transformations T(z) and U(z) affect the state of z at specific times but do not alter the fundamental behavior described by the differential equation."
