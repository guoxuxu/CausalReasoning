  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) where z is a complex number. The function is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real-valued square matrix. This function represents an operator acting on z over time, and we examine the effect of applying an integral transformation with a kernel function \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T B z} \\\\), where B is also a real-valued square matrix and w is another complex variable.\n\nIf at a specific time t = t_1 a transformation using a new kernel \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T C z} \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely be influenced by A and not C or B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new kernel adds a layer of complexity to the function’s evolution, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on A but also on how C interacts with the system. Even if A initially defines the transformation, the intervention with C can redefine or modify the trajectory, leading to a state at T that reflects changes from C.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
