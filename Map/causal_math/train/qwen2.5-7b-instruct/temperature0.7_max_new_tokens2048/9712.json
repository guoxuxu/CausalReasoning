  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine explicitly all interventions applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), merely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying interventions solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is unreliable due to the overlapping influence of the complex matrix exponentials, which can cause similar effects making specific interventions indiscernible. Consequently, without additional data, this deduction proves incorrect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
