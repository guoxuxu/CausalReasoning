  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is used to analyze its frequency components.\n\nIf a periodic function \\\\( s(t) = cos(\\\\omega_1 t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 as an intervention, and then \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is calculated, will the resulting spectrum's primary frequency components be solely determined by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a cosine function to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) introduces new frequency components at \\\\( \\\\pm \\\\omega_1 \\\\) which will significantly influence the spectrum. However, the spectrum will also still contain the inherent frequency components of \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Thus, the spectrum is a result of both the intervention in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the original characteristics of \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Intervening with s(t) changes x(t), which in turn affects z(t) and subsequently influences the primary frequency components in \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\). Since \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\) is derived from z(t), changes in x(t) due to s(t) will impact the spectrum, potentially involving contributions from both x(t) and y(t)."
