  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. Analyze the causal influences when we alter \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a multiplier \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly from observing the altered transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with the modification by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Considering the transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after applying \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), one cannot isolate the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific frequency shift \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Different values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) might result in the same transformed function under certain conditions, making the deduction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ambiguous.",
