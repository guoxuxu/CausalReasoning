  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. Over time, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( T \\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the given system without further modifications, does \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) for some time T represent the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating it with respect to time and multiplying by \\\\( e^{i\\omega s} \\\\), which results in a function fundamentally different from the simple exponential modulation by \\\\( e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). The original function isn't recovered simply by applying transformation \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
