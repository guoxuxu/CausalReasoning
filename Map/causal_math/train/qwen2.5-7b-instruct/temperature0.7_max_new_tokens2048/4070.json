  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iw_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( w_0 \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time. This function is subject to transformations by applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed function at time T, can we determine if the original function was solely \\\\( z(t) = e^{iw_0 t} \\\\) without any additional information about the kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) used in the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), it is not feasible to reverse-engineer or reliably deduce the precise original form of the function, as the transformed output could result from various potential originals modified by different kernels.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z(t) = e^(i*w_0*t) directly influences the transformed function through the application of the linear operator L with kernel K(t, s). The value of w_0 and the variable t directly cause z(t), and the kernel K(t, s) directly causes the transformation of z(t) into the observed transformed function."
