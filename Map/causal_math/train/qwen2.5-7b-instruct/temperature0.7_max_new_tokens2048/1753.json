  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapped in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial state from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Az_0 + B \\\\). This modification alters the trajectory in the complex plane, leading to a different endpoint at t = T, because the transformation affects both the magnitude and phase of the original path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(z_0) directly causes z(T), A and B directly cause T(z_0), t directly causes z(t), and T indirectly influences t."
