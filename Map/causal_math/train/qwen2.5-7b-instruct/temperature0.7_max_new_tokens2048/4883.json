  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, defining a rotation in the complex plane with time. Let's study the system under a transformation specified by the operator \\\\( L \\\\) taken as a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( F[\\\\cdot] \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t + \\\\theta} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a phase shift, will this alteration affect the Fourier spectrum observed at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a phase shift, altering the phase of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Although this does not change the location of the frequency components (still centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)), the phase information in the Fourier transform, represented in complex coefficients, is altered, hence affecting the Fourier spectrum.",

  "causal_map_integration": "An alteration in z'(t) at time t1 will affect the Fourier spectrum observed at time T, which is consistent with the effect of the original z(t) on the Fourier spectrum at time T."
