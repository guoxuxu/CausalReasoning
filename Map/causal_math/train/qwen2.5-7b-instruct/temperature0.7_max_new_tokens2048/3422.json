  "Problem": "Consider a system involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions governed by linear differential equations, and i represents the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T and knowing that a transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) might have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) changes the initial conditions in an irrecoverable way unless the exact value of B and the time of application are known. The angle of rotation added by B may lead to multiple potential initial values \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "By observing z(T) at time T and knowing the transformation f(z) = e^(iBt)z was applied, we can deduce the original complex value z_0 at t = 0. The transformation f(z) → z(T) allows us to reverse the process to find z_0 → z."
