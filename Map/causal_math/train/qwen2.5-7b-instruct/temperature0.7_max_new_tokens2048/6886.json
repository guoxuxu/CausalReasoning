  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). This changes the function domain and potentially the system dynamics.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed system function \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information about \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) strictly requires knowledge of A (to construct the system's exponential behavior) and z_0 (as it represents initial conditions). Without this information, infinite systems could yield the same transformed result under different conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform L(z)(s) of the function z(t) depends on the original function z(t), which in turn depends on the complex constant A and the initial condition z_0."
