  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\) describes the evolution of a variable vector \\\\( z \\\\) through a linear transformation system in time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. Another function \\\\( w(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix, applies another linear transformation at an arbitrary time.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( v(z) = Dz \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( v(z) \\\\) introduces another transformation, making the final state dependent on \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( A \\\\). The transformations relay through the system, and the contribution of each matrix affects the trajectory and eventual state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Hence, all factors influence the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences the state z(t) through the transformation e^(tA). The state z(t) directly influences the state z(T) for T > t. The matrices C and D do not directly influence z(T) if the intervention D occurs only at t_1 and does not affect the continuous transformation described by A."
