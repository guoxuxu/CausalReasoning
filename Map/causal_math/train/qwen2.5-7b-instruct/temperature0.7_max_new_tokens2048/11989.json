  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform and its implications on signal processing.\n\nCan we precisely reconstruct the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its frequency domain representation given by the Fourier transform, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform allows for the exact reconstruction of the time domain signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its frequency domain representation. Given the precise and invertible nature of the Fourier transform for functions like \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\), this process accurately restores the original signal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time-domain function z(t) is transformed into its frequency domain representation through the Fourier transform, and this transformation can be reversed to precisely reconstruct z(t) from its Fourier transform without additional information."
