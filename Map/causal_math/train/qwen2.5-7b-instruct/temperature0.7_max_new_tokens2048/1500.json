  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nGiven the recorded state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions occurred (e.g., \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of interventions and the initial conditions. Effects of transformations like \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can overlap or counteract in ways that make it impossible to decipher the specific transformations applied only from knowing the end state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
