  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze how different scenarios involving the Laplace transformation affect the interpretation of the function and its inverse.\n\nCan we determine the form of the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) solely from its Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), provided \\\\( F(s) \\\\) pertains specifically to \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is uniquely determined for functions for which the transform exists, knowing the transform allows one to uniquely determine the inverse, recovering \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The properties of the Laplace transform enable this unique inversion for standard functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform F(s) of the function e^z is causally related to the original function f(z) such that knowing F(s) allows us to infer f(z), given the specific form of e^z."
