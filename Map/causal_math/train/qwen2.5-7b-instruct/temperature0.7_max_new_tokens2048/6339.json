  "Problem": "Let's analyze a scenario involving the Laplace transform in the context of signal processing. The initial signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) is given, and its transformation through the Laplace transform is considered as \\\\( S(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(s(t))(s) \\\\). Various manipulations and operations are applied to study the causal relationships between transformations and signals.\n\nIf a specific convolution operation (with kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\)) is applied as an intervention in the time domain before taking the Laplace transform, will \\\\( S(s) \\\\) reflect only the changes due to \\\\( k(t) \\\\) without influence from prior signal transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution operation mixes the effects of the kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\) with the original signal, producing a combined effect in the s-domain. Thus, the transformation \\\\( S(s) \\\\) will reflect not only the convolution but also any previous transformations applied to \\\\( s(t) \\\\), showing combined causal influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a convolution with kernel k(t) in the time domain directly influences the resulting signal s(t), which in turn affects its Laplace transform S(s)."
