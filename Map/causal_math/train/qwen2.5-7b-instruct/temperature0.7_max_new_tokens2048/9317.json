  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nIf \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is applied to a solution vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) that satisfies \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) and then \\\\(x\\\\) is allowed to evolve under the equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at any t be a solution to \\\\(Ax = b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Application of \\\\(f(x)\\\\) results in \\\\(Mx_0\\\\), and since M is invertible and \\\\(Ax_0 = b\\\\), multiplying by M does not alter the fact that \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) is still valid due to the properties of matrix equations, meaning the transformed vector remains a solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation M to the initial solution x_0 results in a new vector x' which satisfies the equation Ax = b, and if this x' evolves under the same equation without further intervention, x(t) at any time t will also satisfy Ax = b."
