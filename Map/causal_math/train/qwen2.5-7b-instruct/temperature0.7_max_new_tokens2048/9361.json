  "Problem": "The behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. The impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\), where c is a real constant, is examined over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the coupled equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the given coupled equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition of the system by scaling \\\\( z_0 \\\\), effectively changing the magnitude and potentially phasing of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The evolution according to the differential equations from this new initial condition results in a trajectory different from that of the untransformed \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of z(t) depends on x(t) and y(t), which are influenced by a and b through their derivatives. The transformation h(z) scales z(t) over time t, with c determining the scaling rate. If h(z) is applied at t=0 and then evolves under the differential equations, z(t) at t=T will differ from directly evolving z_0 under the equations, due to the additional scaling effect."
