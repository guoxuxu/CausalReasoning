  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected in series, described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = E(t) \\\\), where \\\\( q(t) \\\\) is the charge and \\\\( E(t) \\\\) is an external voltage source. The relationship to be studied involves examining the behavior of this RLC circuit under the transformation of an applied impulse response function denoted as \\\\( F(t) = e^{-st} \\\\).\n\nIf an impulse response function \\\\( F(t) \\\\) is applied to the initial conditions at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under the differential equation without further intervention, will the charge \\\\( q(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no initial transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( F(t) \\\\) will initially modify the charge by scaling it down, which affects the whole dynamic of the circuit as described by the differential equation. This transformation alters the initial conditions, and hence the trajectory of \\\\( q(t) \\\\) will be different from that without the transformation, especially due to the specific exponential decay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
