  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. The transformation function considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the initial condition was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any changes induced by the exponential factor in the trajectory aren't discernible retrospectively. Distinguishing whether a rotation has affected the initial condition is critical but unachievable without that prior knowledge.",
