  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the initial value problem defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{du}{dx} + q(x)u = 0 \\\\) with initial conditions. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to simplify this differential equation to a form involving complex functions.\n\nIf a Laplace Transform is applied to the differential equation and then inverse transformed without any alterations or supplementary conditions, will the solution \\\\( u(x) \\\\) match the original solution obtained without using the Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform, followed by its appropriate inverse, essentially acts as an identity operation over the set of functions satisfying the differential equation. Hence, the solution remains unchanged if no external conditions or modifications interfere during the process.",
