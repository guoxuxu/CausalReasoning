  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\) and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the Fourier transformation defined by \\( F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\), where \\( \\omega \\) represents angular frequency.\n\nIf an intervention modifying the function from \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z(t) + cos(t) \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\), and then \\( F(z(t)) \\) is calculated, will the outcome at \\( \\omega = 0 \\) rely only on the original function \\( z(t) \\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds \\( cos(t) \\) to \\( z(t) \\), influencing the Fourier transform at \\( \\omega = 0 \\) because the Fourier transform linearly maps the sum of the original and the intervention function. Thus, the transform will reflect changes due not only to the original function but also to the intervention.",
