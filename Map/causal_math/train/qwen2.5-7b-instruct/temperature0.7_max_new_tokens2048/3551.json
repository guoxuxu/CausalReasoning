  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the behavior of a scalar field \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation. The equation is \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. An integral transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) dx \\\\) is applied to study the system's evolution.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by modifying the diffusion constant to \\\\( D' \\\\), will \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial transformation and not on the change in constant from D to D'?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the diffusion constant modifies the underlying behavior of the partial differential equation governing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\). This modification alters how \\\\( u \\\\) diffuses over space, thereby affecting the resultant transform \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\). Since the diffusion process influences the transformation, both the initial conditions and the intervention affect the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion constant D influences the scalar field u(x, t), which in turn affects the transformed field v(x, t). Changing D to D' after time t1 affects u(x, t) for t ≥ t1 but does not directly impact v(x, T) for T > t1 if v(x, t) is solely defined by the initial transformation."
