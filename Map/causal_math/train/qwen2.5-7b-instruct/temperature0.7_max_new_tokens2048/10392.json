  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect on complex numbers in the context of the complex plane transformation. We investigate how this transformation influences the properties of integration along a closed contour C, before and after specific interventions.\n\nBased on the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we conclusively identify which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution of \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping impacts of the transformations and the potential for equivalent integrals from different transformation sequences, it's impossible to uniquely determine the exact transformations applied based solely on the final integral value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) = 1/z transforms the complex number z, influencing the value of the integral along the closed contour C. Similarly, the function g(z) may also transform z, further affecting the integral's value. The transformations applied to z through f(z) and/or g(z) affect the integral's outcome."
