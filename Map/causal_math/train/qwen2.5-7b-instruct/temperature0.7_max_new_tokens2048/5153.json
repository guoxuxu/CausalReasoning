  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(u) = e^{Su} \\\\) where S is a complex square matrix. The system evaluates the function's behavior under the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform to the function \\\\( z(u) = e^{Su} \\\\) at an initial time t = 0 and evolving it change the final output compared to directly applying the Laplace transform to the function after it evolves over time u to a specific time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform captures the integral effect over time, meaning applying the Laplace transform at the start or after time evolution can lead to changes based on how matrix S affects e^{Su} over time, particularly involving complex exponential behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial time t = 0 influences z(u), which then determines Z(s); similarly, the evolved time t = T influences z(u), which also determines Z(s). Applying the Laplace transform before or after evolution does not change the final output Z(s) as long as the same z(u) is used."
