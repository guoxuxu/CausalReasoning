  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\(L[z] = z' + az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{ct}z\\\\) on this system, where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(L[z]\\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be unaffected by the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) modifies the initial condition, changing the trajectory of the system. Since the transformation \\\\(e^{ct}\\\\) scales the function, this alteration will influence the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time \\\\(T\\\\), resulting in a state that depends on both \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation g(z) to z(t) at t=0, followed by evolution under L[z], affects z(t) at t=T; the constant a determines the form of L[z], and the constant c dictates how g(z) modifies z(t)."
