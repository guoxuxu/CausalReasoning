  "Problem": "Analyzing a system under the influence of a complex function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), we examine the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The resultant transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) provides insights into the system's behavior in s-domain.\n\nIs it possible to determine the exact original function and the sequence of transformations (Laplace followed by Fourier) solely by examining the final output in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the end result state in the frequency domain, the overlapping effects of multiple linear transformations (Laplace and Fourier) can mask the exact origins and sequence of operations. Different initial functions or transformation sequences may result in similar or identical frequency domain representations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(z) is determined by the complex constant a and the variable z. The Laplace transform L converts f(z) into F(s), which provides insights into the system's behavior in the frequency domain."
