  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) denote the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\) respectively. The system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. Let us explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z(t)) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(z(t)) \\\\) is computed on the evolved state \\\\( z(T) = e^{AT}z_0 + (e^{AT} - 1)A^{-1}B \\\\) at T, will the Fourier transform's outcome from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be identical without applying Fourier to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolving?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform after the system's evolution includes the effect of both A and B within the system dynamics, which alters the frequency components. This is different from transforming the initial state alone and then trying to evolve it under the dynamical law, due to the non-commutative nature of the operations involved.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) depends on x(t), y(t), A, and B. Applying the Fourier transform to z(T) results from the evolution of z(t) over time T starting from z_0. Therefore, the Fourier transform of z(T) is not identical to the Fourier transform applied to z_0 without considering the effect of A and B over time."
