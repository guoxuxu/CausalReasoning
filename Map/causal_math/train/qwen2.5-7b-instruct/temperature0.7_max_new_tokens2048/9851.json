  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane dynamics described by the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ u(t) \\} = U(s) \\) of a temporal function \\( u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\). We study the effect of a convolution operator defined by \\( h(t) \\) over the signal \\( u(t) \\), resulting in \\( v(t) = (h * u)(t) \\).\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a filtering by \\( g(t) \\) (where its Laplace transform is \\( G(s) \\)) is applied to \\( v(t) \\), resulting in \\( w(t) = (g * v)(t) \\), will \\( W(s) \\) at a later time depend only on \\( V(s) \\) and not \\( G(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\( g(t) \\) introduces another convolution, and hence, in the Laplace domain, \\( W(s) = G(s)V(s) = G(s)H(s)U(s) \\), which indeed depends on \\( G(s) \\), \\( H(s) \\), and \\( U(s) \\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the input signal u(t), U(s), determines V(s) through the convolution with h(t); V(s) determines W(s) through the convolution with g(t), but W(s) is also directly influenced by the convolution of v(t) with g(t), which results in w(t)."
