  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). This changes the function domain and potentially the system dynamics.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( B \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), resulting in a new function \\\\( e^{B(t-t_1)}z(t_1) \\\\), will the outcome of the Laplace transform, \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) at any s, be dependent only on the new matrix \\\\( B \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome will depend on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The system's state up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is influenced by \\\\( A \\\\), and post-intervention dynamics depend on \\\\( B \\\\). The combined effect of both matrices will influence the final transformed system, not merely the latter interval's matrix.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of A influences z(t) and L(z)(s), while B influences z(t) and L(z)(s) after the intervention at t_1. The change from A to B affects z(t) starting from t_1, which then impacts L(z)(s)."
