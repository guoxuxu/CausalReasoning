  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving an integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. In this context, assume that \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), with A being a real constant. Further assume that the Laplace transform is uniquely invertible.\n\nIf we modify the value of s while transforming \\\\( f(t) \\\\), will the original influence of A on the Laplace transform outcome remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Altering s alters the Laplace transform by changing the exponential kernel \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} e^{At} dt \\\\). This is equivalent to evaluating a different transform, where the results now depend sensitively on both s and A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A directly influences the outcome through s, which means changing s while keeping A constant does not change the original influence of A on the Laplace transform outcome."
