  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), known as the wave equation. We explore the influence of a Fourier transform applied initially (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\)) and how it impacts the propagation of the wave over time.\n\nGiven the wave profile at time T, can the specific interventions applied (Fourier transform, Laplace transform, or both) be exactly identified based only on the observation of the wave profile at that time?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations or their sequence based only on the observed state at time T is generally infeasible. The multiple transformations can yield overlapping effects on the wave profile, rendering it a non-unique scenario where different combinations of interventions might result in similar or indistinguishable outcomes at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
