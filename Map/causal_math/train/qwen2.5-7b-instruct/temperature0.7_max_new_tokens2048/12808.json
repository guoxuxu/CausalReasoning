  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), typically representing a harmonic oscillator. We study the effect of a Fourier transform applied to the initial velocity condition \\\\( v_0 \\\\) and its impact over time.\n\nIf the initial velocity \\\\( v_0 \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform \\\\( F(v_0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\) without further intervention, will the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t be the same as if the original \\\\( v_0 \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial velocity \\\\( v_0 \\\\) alters the frequency components of the system's initial state, potentially impacting how the displacement evolves over time according to the system equation. Variations in these components due to the transform will result in a different displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) directly influences the velocity \\( v(t) \\) and subsequently the displacement \\( x(t) \\); applying a Fourier transform to the initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) results in a transformed velocity \\( F(v_0) \\) which also directly influences the velocity \\( v(t) \\) and consequently the displacement \\( x(t) \\)."
