  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z = x^T C x + bx\\\\), where x is a vector, C is a symmetric matrix, and b is another vector. We are examining the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Dx\\\\), where D is a regular matrix, on the output z.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at the initial time, and then z is evaluated without further manipulation, will \\\\(z\\\\) at this point be the same as z evaluated directly from \\\\(x_0\\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Dx\\\\) changes the initial vector to \\\\(Dx_0\\\\), which alters how it interacts with C and b in the system equation. This results in a potentially different value of z given the quadratic and linear dependencies on x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(x) → z changes the value of z compared to evaluating z directly from x → z unless D is the identity matrix."
