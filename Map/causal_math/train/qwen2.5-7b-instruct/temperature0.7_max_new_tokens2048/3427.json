  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where x is a fixed complex number, and A is a complex constant. We investigate the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after applying the integral transformation \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional function transformation \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + Ce^{Dt} \\\\) where C and D are constants is applied, does this intervention affect the value of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at any T > t_1 compared to the original system governed by A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new additive transformation results in a modified function, changing the integrand from merely \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) to include \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\). This intervention alters subsequent values of z(t) and thus impacts the integral \\\\( w(t) \\\\), deviating from the path had no intervention occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
