  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = C e^{Dt} x \\\\), with C and D being constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) as the initial state vector. We explore the implications of performing a Laplace transform on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze the system in the s-domain, denoted as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = C(sI - D)^{-1}x \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some point after the intervention, can we determine precisely when the intervention happened and what the new matrix E was?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact time of intervention and the specifics of the matrix E from the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is highly complex due to overlapping influences and possible equivalent transformations yielding the same output. The s-domain representation abstracts away the temporal dynamics making it difficult to pinpoint the exact nature and timing of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
