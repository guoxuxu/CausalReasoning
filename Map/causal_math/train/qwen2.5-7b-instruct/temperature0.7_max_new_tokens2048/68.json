  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation governing heat distribution \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with initial heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\). An operation \\\\(g(u) = e^{wt}u\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(w\\) is a constant, which alters the heat distribution dynamically.\n\nKnowing the heat distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we accurately trace back and determine which transformations (\\\\(g(u)\\\\), \\\\(h(u)\\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the observed distribution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linear and reversible characteristics of the transformations \\\\(g(u)\\\\) and \\\\(h(u)\\\\) over the linear heat equation, multiple transformation sequences could yield the same heat distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\). Consequently, it is not feasible to uniquely identify the interventions merely by observing the distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
