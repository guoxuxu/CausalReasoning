  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit involving a resistor, inductor, and capacitor in series, governed by the second-order linear differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C} i = 0\\\\). Suppose a voltage transformation given by \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\) is applied to the circuit, where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial current \\\\( i(0) \\\\) and its derivative \\\\( \\\\frac{di}{dt}(0) \\\\) just by knowing the current at a later time t, assuming no knowledge about the application of \\\\( v(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the voltage transformation \\\\( v(t) \\\\) was applied or not, it is not possible to uniquely determine the initial state of the current due to the potential modification of the system's behavior by external voltage.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the voltage transformation v(t) results in a current i(t) flowing through the circuit, and the rate of change of this current di/dt(t) is directly influenced by i(t)."
