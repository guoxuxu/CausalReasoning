  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system controlled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = r(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\), where \\\\( r(t) \\\\) is the amplitude and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) is the phase. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) with a complex constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is considered over time t.\n\nKnowing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally infer the interventions used (whether the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or neither) based solely on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the same end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), different combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and their timings, can lead to identical outcomes because the effects on amplitude and phase can mask each other. This makes it impossible to definitively determine which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
