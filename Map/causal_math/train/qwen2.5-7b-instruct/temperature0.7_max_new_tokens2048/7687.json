  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement and c is the wave speed. The medium through which the wave travels undergoes a transformation defined by a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time t_1, a scaling intervention \\\\( g(u) = ku \\\\) (where k is another constant) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the wave equation parameters and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions introduced by scaling and damping influence the wave's evolution. The final form of the wave \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) is dependent not only on the wave's propagation characteristics dictated by c, but also significantly influenced by the damping factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\), affecting the wave's amplitude and energy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Wave speed c, spatial coordinate x, time t, damping factor alpha, and scaling constant k each influence the displacement u, but the endpoint u(x,T) for T > t_1 depends only on c, x, t, and not on alpha or k."
