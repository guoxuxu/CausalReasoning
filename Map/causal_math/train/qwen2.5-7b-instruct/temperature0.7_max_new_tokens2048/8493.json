  "Problem": "Analyze a system where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(y)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} y(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), giving a transformed function in the frequency domain. Consider effects of an inverse transformation and external modulation by a function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) applied at a specific time.\n\nIf a signal \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes Fourier Transformation and is left to propagate without further intervention, will the inverse Fourier Transform recover the original signal exactly at time \\\\(T\\\\), assuming no loss of information in transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier Transform will theoretically recover the original signal perfectly, assuming the transform and its inverse are correctly applied and integral calculations are exact, despite temporal shifts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The signal y(t) undergoes Fourier transformation to produce F(y)(ω), and an inverse Fourier transform can recover y(t) from F(y)(ω) without loss of information, provided no data is lost during the initial transformation."
