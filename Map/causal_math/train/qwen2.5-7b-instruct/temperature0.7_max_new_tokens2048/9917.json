  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation on a function \\( u(x) \\) represented as \\( T[u(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{st} u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of changing the order of integration and differentiation operations under the transformation.\n\nIf \\( T \\) is applied to a function \\( u(x) \\), and \\( u(x) \\) is left to evolve under its natural properties without further intervention, will the derivative \\( \\frac{d}{ds} T[u(x)] \\) reflect only the characteristics of \\( u(x) \\) at any point \\( s \\) in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The derivative \\( \\frac{d}{ds} T[u(x)] \\) involves both the characteristics of \\( u(x) \\) and the interaction of \\( s \\) with \\( u(x) \\) through the integral and exponential components, which means it's not solely representative of \\( u(x) \\)'s natural properties.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T to the function u(x) results in T[u(x)], which then depends on the parameter s; differentiating T[u(x)] with respect to s reflects changes in T[u(x)] due to variations in s, but this derivative also implicitly includes the characteristics of u(x) as T operates on it."
