  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z}\\\\) and its effect through a contour integral \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\), where C is a closed contour path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of modifying the path C to another path C' and the use of another complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nIf at some point during the computation a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting computation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C h(w) dw \\\\) be independent of the initial function g?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) replaces the original function \\\\( g(w) = e^w \\\\). Thus, the outcome \\\\( f(z) \\\\) becomes entirely dependent on \\\\( h(z) \\\\), irrespective of the initial function \\\\( g(w) \\\\), provided there are no additional constraints or links between g and h.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The path C determines the value of f(z). The function g(z) influences f(z) through the integral over C. Applying h(z) as an intervention changes the integrand to h(w), thus f(z) becomes the integral of h(w) over C, making f(z) dependent on both C and h(z)."
