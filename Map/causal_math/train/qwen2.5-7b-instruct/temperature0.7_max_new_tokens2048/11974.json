  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant matrix, and z a complex variable. We explore how the function transforms under the action of a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\), where B is another complex constant matrix and C is a closed contour in the complex plane.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is applied at some point between \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_1 \\\\), will the resulting function at \\\\( z_1 \\\\) be dependent only on the effects of matrix A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\) introduces a new dynamic into the system, influenced by matrix B. Thus, even at point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), the function reflects combined influences of both A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of f(z) depends on matrix A, and the integral transformation g(f) depends on matrix B; therefore, the resulting function at z1 is influenced by both A and B."
