  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y + p(t)x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x + p(t)y \\\\), and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a known function of time t.\n\nIf an additional manipulating function \\\\( q(t)z \\\\), is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final observation \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be dependent only on the original equations and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(t)z \\\\) modifies the evolution rules for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), thus altering the system’s trajectory. This makes the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the original coupled dynamics and the new intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "p(t) affects both x(t) and y(t) directly; x(t) and y(t) mutually influence each other; applying q(t)z as an intervention at t_1 changes z(t) from t_1 onwards."
