  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We look into how the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a real constant, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) changes the initial conditions by multiplying \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) at t=0, effectively altering the phase of the initial vector. This modification affects the trajectory under the original system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T due to phase shifts induced by B.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0, through the evolution under the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\), determines z(t). Applying h(z) to z_0 before evolution does not change the final state of z(t) at time T compared to evolving z_0 directly under the same differential equation. The constants A and B influence z(t) through their roles in the differential equation and transformation respectively."
