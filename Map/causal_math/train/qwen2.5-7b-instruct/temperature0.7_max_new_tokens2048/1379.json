  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation matrix T, where \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) changes the basis of the solution and subsequently applying the inverse transformation \\\\( T^{-1}y = x \\\\).\n\nIf the system is intervened by applying an additional transformation \\\\( U \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), such that \\\\( Ux = z \\\\), and then transforming back using \\\\( U^{-1}z = x \\\\) at time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x \\\\) necessarily satisfy \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) regardless of the specifics of U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( U^{-1} \\\\) affects the trajectory and may alter the condition under which \\\\( x \\\\) solves \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). The change in basis may not preserve the particular solution due to properties of the transformation matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformation U to x results in z, then applying T to z results in y, and finally applying the inverse of T to y returns x to its original form, which satisfies the equation Ax = b."
