  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the effects of transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we precisely determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If it's unknown whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the differential amplitude attenuation caused by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) complicates back-tracking to the original state. The lack of information on whether the decay factor was introduced means multiple potential original states could lead to the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
