  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(w) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\), mapped over the complex plane. We are interested in examining the changes in the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed contour in the w-plane, particularly under the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\).\n\nIf a new function \\\\( H(w) = e^{aw} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention at some point during the contour evolution, will the resulting integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) solely depend on the original function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( T(w) \\\\) or \\\\( H(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(w) = e^{aw} \\\\) further modifies the path and value of \\\\( w \\\\) along contour \\\\( C \\\\), which will in turn affect the computed values of \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\) over \\\\( C \\\\). Both transformations \\\\( T(w) \\\\) and \\\\( H(w) \\\\) significantly influence the integral, thereby making the result dependent not only on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) but also on the effects of \\\\( T(w) \\\\) and \\\\( H(w) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(w) and the intervention H(w) can influence the contour C, which in turn affects the integral ∫_C z(w) dw, as it depends on the path C in the w-plane. The integral ∫_C z(w) dw is directly caused by the function z(w) through the contour C, but changes in C due to T(w) and H(w) can alter this integral."
