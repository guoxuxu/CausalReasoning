  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) under transformation by a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) described by the integral transform \\\\(L(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt\\\\) over some interval. Assess how the behavior and interpretation of z changes when subjected directly or through transformation L.\n\nIf the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve without any further intervention, will the resultant function be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under its original definition without any transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(L\\\\) transforms \\\\(z(t)\\\\) into a different function due to the integral transform, which changes the original nature and characteristics of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), such as frequency content and phase, affecting its evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
