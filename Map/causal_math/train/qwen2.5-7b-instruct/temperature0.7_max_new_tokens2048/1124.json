  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this function, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the modified Fourier transform result after unknown phase shift interventions, can we determine precisely the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the nature of the phase shifts \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift intervention modifies the spectral properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a way that is generally irreversible without additional information about \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\). Since the phase shift can vary with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), different phase shifts might yield the same final modified transform, making it infeasible to uniquely determine both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
