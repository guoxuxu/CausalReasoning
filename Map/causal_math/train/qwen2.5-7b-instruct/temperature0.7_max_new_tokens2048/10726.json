  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( t \\) represents time. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation defined by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) as \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\), can we unequivocally determine that the original function was \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) without prior information about the form of \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function in the Fourier transform result specifically at \\( \\omega \\) directly points to the original function being \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). This is a unique characteristic of the Fourier transform of a pure exponential function at a specific frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
