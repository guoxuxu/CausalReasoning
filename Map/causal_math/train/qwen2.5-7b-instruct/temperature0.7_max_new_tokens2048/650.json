  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function and its inverse transform in a control system where the transfer function is given by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Consider the impact of manipulating these transformations through convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the exact nature of the initial input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) exclusively by the function \\\\( y(T) \\\\) without the knowledge of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to the exact input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) solely based on the output. The relationship between output and input is mediated by \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and lacking this complicates the causal inference from effect to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(t) → F(s); F(s) → H(s); H(s) → Y(s); Y(s) ↔ G(s) → G(s); Y(s) → y(T); H(s) → G(s)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) transforms into F(s) via the Laplace transform, F(s) interacts with H(s) to produce Y(s), Y(s) is related to y(T) through the inverse Laplace transform, and G(s) represents the Laplace transform of g(t) which convolves with Y(s)."
