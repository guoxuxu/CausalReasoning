  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We analyze the behavior of the function under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another constant complex number) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, only depend on the matrices A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) further modifies the state, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on A, B, and C. The interactions of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) affect the trajectory and endpoint in complex ways.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) depends on A, B, and C through their respective exponential transformations, but given T > t_1, z(T) only directly reflects the effects of A after t_1 due to the application of k(z)."
