  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\), and a transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. This transformation represents an integral transformation affecting the signal over time.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{tB}z(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the effects of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention via the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) incorporates an additional layer of mathematical operation which interacts with the previous state influenced by \\\\( A \\\\). Both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) have roles in shaping the final state through their respective transformations, influencing how \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolves and expresses itself.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(t) → z(t+Δt); h(z) → z(t); g(z) → z(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time is influenced by the linear differential operator L. The transformation h(z) integrates the effect of A on z(s) up to time t, while g(z) integrates the effect of B on z(t) up to time t_1. For T > t_1, the final state z(T) depends on both h(z) and g(z), meaning it is not independent of the effects of A and B."
