  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) and its original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). We are scrutinizing the influence of a linear operator \\\\( T \\\\) operating on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f(t)] = t \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\).\n\nSuppose another operator \\\\( U \\\\) defined as \\\\( U[f(t)] = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is applied after \\\\( T \\\\), will the final Laplace Transform be \\\\( L[U[T[f(t)]]] \\\\) only dependent on the actions of \\\\( T \\\\) and not \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( U \\\\) after \\\\( T \\\\) brings an additional modification to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), specifically, it modifies the function by a decaying exponential factor. The resulting Laplace Transform, which encapsulates both operations, wields the combined effect of the operations, showing dependence on both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying operator T to f(t) results in T[f(t)], then applying operator U to T[f(t)] yields U[T[f(t)]], and finally, taking the Laplace transform of U[T[f(t)]] produces L[U[T[f(t)]]], which depends on both T and U."
