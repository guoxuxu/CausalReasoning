  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional space where a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y)) \\\\) influences particle trajectories. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation defined by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), which rotates vectors by a fixed angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nIf the linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to a vector field configuration at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will particle trajectories be fundamentally altered compared to their behavior without applying \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) modifies the initial orientation of the vector field, changing how particles react to the field. The resulting trajectories will be different as the rotation can change the effective dynamics that guide the particles.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation L will alter the vector field (u(x,y), v(x,y)), which in turn will change the particle trajectories."
