  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Investigate how the Fourier transform affects this system, particularly through a transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i \\omega' t} dt \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is the variable of transformation.\n\nObserving the output of the Fourier transform as a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\\\), can we unequivocally infer the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) without knowing the initial function form?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\\\) in the Fourier transform uniquely suggests that the original function was a pure exponential of the form \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), as this is the only function that results in such a transform under standard conditions without additional transformations.",
