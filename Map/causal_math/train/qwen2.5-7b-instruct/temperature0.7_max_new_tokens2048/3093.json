  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the impact of the Laplace Transform and its inverse on this function over time.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is computed and then directly inverted using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\), without any external modification, will the resulting function over time \\\\( t \\\\) be identical to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform followed by its inverse on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), under perfect mathematical conditions and without any losses or external interventions, will ideally recover the original function. This is due to the properties of the Laplace Transform where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}\\\\} = z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
