  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sC} f(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant coefficient, on this complex function over time t.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to T under its respective differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) alters the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from the outset, affecting the evolution dictated by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\). The integration transformation incorporates memory of the function's past states, weighted exponentially, which cannot be replicated simply through direct evolution under the differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t depends on x(t) and y(t), which evolve according to the constants A and B respectively. The integral transformation T(f) applied to z(t) at t=0 and then allowed to evolve under differential equations results in z(T) that is influenced by both the initial conditions and the constants A and B, similar to evolving z(t) directly from t=0 to T under the same differential equations."
