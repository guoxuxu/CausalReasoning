  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(u) = u + c\\\\) where c is a constant offset applied to the temperature distribution.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution at time T, \\\\( u'(x,T) \\\\), can we deduce the exact original distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine the original distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). The subtraction of the unknown constant c would be necessary to retrieve the correct initial conditions, introducing uncertainty unless the intervention is known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
