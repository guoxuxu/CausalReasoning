  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The Laplace Transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how changes in the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) influence the transformed function over the complex plane.\n\nIf the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) is increased, will this lead to a decrease in the modulus of its Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) \\\\) for all \\\\( s \\\\) in the right half of the complex plane (Re(s) > 0)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( a \\\\) deepens the exponential decay of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), leading to a smaller area under the curve when integrating from 0 to \\\\infty. Therefore, the modulus of the Laplace Transform, which is essentially the weighted area under the curve, decreases for all positive real parts of \\\\( s \\\\), confirming a reduced overall impact of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) on its transform.",
