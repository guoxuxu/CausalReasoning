  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z) = p(t) \\\\cdot z' + q(t) \\\\cdot z \\\\) where \\\\( ' \\\\) denotes the derivative with respect to t, and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) are time-varying coefficients.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) at some time T, can we retrieve \\\\( z(0) \\\\) directly without knowing the forms of \\\\( p(t) \\\\), \\\\( q(t) \\\\), and \\\\( r(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely from \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) is infeasible without additional information about the coefficients \\\\( p(t) \\\\), \\\\( q(t) \\\\), and \\\\( r(t) \\\\). These functions shape the modified dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\), and their unknown variations can lead to multiple possible initial conditions that could have resulted in the observed \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\).",
