  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined on the complex plane. We evaluate the responses to integrations involving the complex function and the related impacts given by the transform \\\\( g(z) = e^{2\\\\pi iz} \\\\).\n\nFrom observing the result of the transformation at t = 1, can we infer whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without prior information on the function used?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations can map multiple distinct inputs to the same output (due to the periodic nature of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the squaring property of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)). Without prior information, one cannot uniquely determine whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
