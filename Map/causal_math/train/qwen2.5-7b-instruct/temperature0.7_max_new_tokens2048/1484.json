  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario, where the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined by a Fourier transform of another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), specifically \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-izt} dt \\\\). We examine the implications of changing the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) represents a delta function.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform after applying a linear filtering intervention, can we uniquely determine whether the original function was \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of linear systems and convolution, multiple combinations of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\), and filtering functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can result in the same Fourier transform outcome. Specific characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the original function complexity can mask the effects of the delta function, rendering a unique determination impossible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function g(t) directly influences its Fourier transform h(z), and adding a delta function δ(t) to g(t) results in a new Fourier transform h'(z) that directly reflects this change."
