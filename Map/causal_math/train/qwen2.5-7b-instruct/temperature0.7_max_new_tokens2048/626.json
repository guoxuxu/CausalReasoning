  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving as per the dynamical system given by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it is not feasible to accurately trace back to the precise original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), particularly because the complex exponential could have fundamentally changed the initial conditions.",
