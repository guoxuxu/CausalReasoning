  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) represents a transformation over time t, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial state to \\\\( e^{N0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but evolving from this altered state under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) will generally result in a different outcome at t = T because \\\\( e^{(M+N)t} \\\\) is not generally equal to \\\\( e^{Mt}e^{Nt} \\\\) due to non-commutativity of matrix exponentials.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) directly influences z(t) through the differential equation M → dz/dt. Applying the transformation f(z) at t=0 does not change the evolution of z(t) under the differential equation M → dz/dt, so z(t) at t=T will be the same whether z_0 evolves directly under M or first transforms with f(z) and then evolves under M."
