  "Problem": "Study the effect of a complex function \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\) on a real variable \\\\( x \\\\) and its integration relating to the Fourier transform of a signal \\\\( s(t) \\), represented as \\\\( S(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} s(t) e^{-i2\\pi f t} dt. \\\\)\n\nIf a normalization process is applied to \\\\( s(t) \\\\) post the transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\), does the Fourier transform \\\\( S(f) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( f \\\\) exclusively depend on the initial function \\\\( s(t) \\\\) without consideration of the transformation effect?",
  "Explanation": "The normalization process will affect the amplitude spectra but not eliminate the phase shift effects introduced by \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\). Therefore, the Fourier transform \\\\( S(f) \\\\) will still reflect changes induced by the transformation and not solely depend on the original \\\\( s(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform S(f) of a signal s(t) is influenced by the signal s(t) itself and the transformation z → e^(iz). Applying a normalization process to s(t) post-transformation does not eliminate the dependency on s(t); hence, S(f) still depends on s(t)."
