  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Mx \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the matrix A to a new matrix \\\\( A' \\\\) at some point, and the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) was initially applied, will the final solution vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) directly depend only on \\\\( A' \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( M \\\\) and the subsequent modification to the matrix A compound their effects. Thus, the final state of the solution \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on both the original transformation \\\\( M \\\\) and the new matrix \\\\( A' \\\\), as they collectively define the evolution of the solution vector.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
