  "Problem": "Consider a control system influenced by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the scenario under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Sx \\\\) applied at time t, with S also being a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions (either \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not feasible without additional information. The variable influences of S and P and potential overlap in resulting trajectories under M mean multiple intervention combinations could lead to the same endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
