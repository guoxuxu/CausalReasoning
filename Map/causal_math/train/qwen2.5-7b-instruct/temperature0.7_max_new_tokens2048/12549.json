  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a second order linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant representing the speed of sound. We explore the influence of applying an initial displacement by a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) denotes spatial coordinates.\n\nGiven the displacement \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we determine the exact initial displacement \\\\( h(x) \\\\) that was applied at t = 0, assuming no initial velocity?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial displacement \\\\( h(x) \\\\) from the observed displacement at time T requires knowledge of initial velocities, too, under typical conditions. Since the system might exhibit symmetric behaviors or overtones, multiple initial profiles could result in the same observed displacement at T without additional information.",
