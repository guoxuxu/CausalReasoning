  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\). This differential equation describes a rotation in the complex plane. The function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) changes the magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), thereby altering both its trajectory and final position in the complex plane at any time t, making \\\\( z(t) \\\\) different due to the scaling effect of \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(z0) → z(t); z0 → z(t); k → f(z); t → f(z); t → z(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z0) results in z(t), which depends on z0, k, and t; the evolution under z'(t) = iz(t) starting from z0 at t = 0 leads to z(t), which also depends on z0 and t."
