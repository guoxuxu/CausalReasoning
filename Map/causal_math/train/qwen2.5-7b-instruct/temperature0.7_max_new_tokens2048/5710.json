  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a material is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effect of an external heat source, which is modeled as \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), added to specific points in the material at time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely determine the initial heat distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) by observing the temperature distribution at time \\\\( T \\\\) if \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) was potentially added?",
  "Explanation": "With the potential addition of the heat source \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial conditions solely from final observations, as the source could significantly affect the temperature evolution in various, unknown ways.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
