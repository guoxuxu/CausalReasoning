  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant input voltage \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and a resistive load R. A time-varying inductance \\\\( L(t) = L_0 e^{kt} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) through the circuit over time.\n\nIf the inductance \\\\( L(t) \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the circuit is allowed to operate without further intervention, will the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if the inductance had remained constant at \\\\( L_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The time-varying inductance affects the impedance of the circuit, changing how the current evolves over time. Specifically, a higher inductance results in lower current for the same voltage, and the exponential term \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) modifies the current's growth rate, making it differ from the case with constant inductance.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time-varying inductance L(t) influences the current I(t), which is also caused by the constant input voltage V_0 and the resistance R."
