  "Problem": "Consider the role of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the position of a particle in a two-dimensional space. This function is subjected to a transformation using a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We study the impact of this transformation and potential interventions on the system.\n\nIf an intervention is applied via another transformation, \\\\( H(z)(\\\\omega) = F(z)(\\\\omega) + K \\\\), with a constant \\\\( K \\\\), will the resultant Fourier spectrum still allow for the reconstruction of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a constant \\\\( K \\\\) to the Fourier transform alters the spectrum and consequently affects the ability to accurately reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the modified Fourier transform \\\\( H(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). The nature and magnitude of \\\\( K \\\\) can influence different frequencies differently, leading to inaccuracies or ambiguities in reconstructing the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The positions x(t) and y(t) determine the complex function z(t); the Fourier transform F(z)(ω) of z(t) is modified by adding a constant K to become H(z)(ω), which can still allow for the reconstruction of z(t) if K is known."
