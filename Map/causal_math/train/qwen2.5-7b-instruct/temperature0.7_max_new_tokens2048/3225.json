  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), commonly referred to as the heat equation. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) = U(k, t) \\\\), is applied to the system.\n\nIf we apply the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then let the system evolve according to the heat equation, will \\\\( U(k, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to direct application of the heat equation followed by the Fourier transform at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and time-invariance of the heat equation allow the Fourier transform to commute with the time evolution operator of the system. Thus, transforming first and then evolving the system or evolving first and then transforming will yield the same result in the frequency domain at any time \\\\( t = T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) transforms via the Fourier transform to U(k, t), which then evolves over time t according to the heat equation to become u(x, t), and this process is consistent with applying the heat equation to u(x, 0) and then taking the Fourier transform at time t = T."
