  "Problem": "Analyzing a system driven by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + k \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where k is a wave speed constant. The influence of a transformation characterized by \\\\( T(u) = u e^{-ikx} \\\\) is tested, which can affect how solutions are represented in the complex domain.\n\nCan we decisively identify whether the initial application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) or the intervention of \\\\( S(u) \\\\) was performed, solely from the knowledge of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at some \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations affect the solution in potentially overlapping ways, making it impossible to unravel their individual contributions solely based on the resultant state at \\\\( T \\\\). Without specific markers or additional data, identifying which transformations occurred is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(u) or S(u) influences the representation of u in the complex domain, which can be observed through changes in u(x,T) at some T > t_1."
