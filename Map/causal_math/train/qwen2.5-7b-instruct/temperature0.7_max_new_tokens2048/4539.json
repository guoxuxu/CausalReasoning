  "Problem": "A complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined where \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied, and the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied under this transformation over time.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both transformations due to their compound effects. Starting with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) means the trajectory initially follows \\\\( z(t) = e^{2it} \\\\) until \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and then \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes it to \\\\( e^{6it} \\\\) (since tripling the doubled angle results in six times the original angle). Therefore, the trajectory, and hence the final state at T, depends on both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying g(z) transforms z(t) to z^2, while applying h(z) transforms z(t) to z^3. Both transformations affect z(t), but the final state z(T) for T > t_1 depends on the sequence and timing of these transformations."
