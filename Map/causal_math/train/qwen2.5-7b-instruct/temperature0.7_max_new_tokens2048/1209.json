  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). To further analyze or manipulate the signal, an operator \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied in the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is generated from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via Fourier Transform and then immediately subjected to the transformation by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the resulting signal's inverse Fourier Transform \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was first modified by an inverse transformation corresponding to \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) directly in the frequency domain post-Fourier Transform generally yields different results compared to modifying \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with a corresponding inverse operation first, due to differences in how operations affect signals in time versus frequency domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator P(ω) in the frequency domain after Fourier transforming x(t) to X(ω) results in a different time-domain signal x'(t) than first applying the inverse of P(ω) to x(t) to get X'(ω) and then Fourier transforming X'(ω) back to the time domain."
