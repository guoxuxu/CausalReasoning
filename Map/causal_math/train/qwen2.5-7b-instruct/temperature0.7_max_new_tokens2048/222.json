  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(t, y(t)) = \\\\int_0^T k(t, s) y(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a function of time evolved from initial conditions under some autonomous differential equation. We test causal reasoning about the impact of modifying the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\).\n\nCan the original kernel function \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) be uniquely determined at time t = 0 after observing the transformed output \\\\( g(T, y(T)) \\\\) at t = T without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and the specific form of the integral transformation, multiple different kernel functions could potentially yield the same transformation output at t = T, resulting in an inability to uniquely identify \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
