  "Problem": "Examine a system where electric potential V is described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) within a region and manipulate the boundary conditions to observe causal effects. We're especially interested in how transformations such as conformal mappings can infer changes in electric field distributions.\n\nIf after a conformal mapping \\\\(f(z) = z^2\\\\), an external electric field of known configuration is introduced, will the altered distribution of \\\\(V\\\\) depend solely on the new boundary conditions and not on the specific form of \\\\(f\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final potential distribution \\\\(V\\\\) in the region will now be influenced by both the external field and the underlying domain shape altered by the mapping. Hence, both the new boundary conditions and the specific form of the transformation \\\\(f(z) = z^2\\\\) affect \\\\(V\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
