  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix and z a complex variable. We examine how the integral transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw\\\\) influences behavior over the complex plane.\n\nGiven the function value \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at some point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we infer the exact value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) used in the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly from \\\\( h(z_1) \\\\) is not feasible without knowing more about the influence of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The integration and complex exponential make it challenging to isolate and reverse engineer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( h(z_1) \\\\) as multiple inputs may lead to the same output due to the nature of complex exponentials and integrals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of f(z) determines g(z), which in turn relates to h(z) through z_1. The value of z influences f(z), which then affects g(z) and subsequently h(z). Without additional information, knowing h(z) at z_1 does not allow us to uniquely determine z_0 used in the transformation g(z)."
