  "Problem": "Consider a system of equations governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is applied to this system resulting in the transformed function \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( x(s) \\\\) at s = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x(s) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) introduces an integral dependency on the history of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) from 0 to t. As such, the evolution of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) affects \\\\( u(t) \\\\) differently than just evolving \\\\( x(s) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), leading to potentially different results at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function x(s) directly influences u(t) through the integral transformation with kernel K(t,s). The operator Lx evolves x(s) over time, and this evolution influences u(t) indirectly through the integral. Without further intervention, u(T) at t = T from the transformation does not necessarily match the direct evolution of x(s) to t = T under Lx."
