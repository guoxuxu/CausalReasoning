  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), with \\\\( F(z) = Az + C \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and C is a constant vector. We analyze the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and its inverse \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) applied to this system over time.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed system's state at time T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z(0) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform alters the domain of the function, moving into the s-plane where operations are performed based on the complex frequency variable s. This transformation changes the nature of how the function evolves over time as it now adheres to a different set of operational rules, and direct traversal from t=0 to t=T in the time domain cannot be replicated exactly in the transformed domain without reversing the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(0) → z(t); F(z) → dz/dt; L[z(0)] → Z(s); Z(s) → z(t) via inverse transform",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) directly influences z(t) through the differential equation F(z). The Laplace transform L[z(0)] results in Z(s), which when inverted via L^(-1) gives z(t) that evolves similarly to z(t) directly from z(0) under F(z)."
