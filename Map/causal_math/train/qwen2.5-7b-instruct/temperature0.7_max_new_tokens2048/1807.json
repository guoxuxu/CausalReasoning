  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz + D\\\\), where C is a matrix and D is a vector constant. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Mz + N \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector, at an initial time t = 0.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = Pz + Q \\\\) (where P is another constant matrix and Q is another constant vector) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), T > t_1, reflect only the influence of matrix C and not the transformations by M or P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) adds additional complexity to the system evolution, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on all applied transformations - M, P as well as matrix C. The changes introduced by P and Q at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) also modify the trajectory substantially, leading to a composite effect influenced by all parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) is influenced by matrix C but not by matrices M or P directly. Matrix M affects the initial state z(t=0), and matrix P affects the state at t=t1, which then evolves under matrix C until T."
