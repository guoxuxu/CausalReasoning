  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (A u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a state variable and \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant vector field. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), which changes \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) to its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an operation such as a convolution with a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied as an intervention and the system continues to evolve under the same PDE, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original PDE and not on the convolution?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with convolution alters the state variable \\\\( u \\\\) by integrating additional information or disturbance into the system, thereby directly influencing the subsequent evolution of \\\\( u \\\\) under the PDE. Hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on both the original PDE dynamics and the convolutional effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "F(u) → u_hat(k, t); u(x, t) → u(x, T); A → ∇ · (A u); t_1 → convolution_with_g(x); convolution_with_g(x) → u(x, t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform F(u) converts the state variable u(x, t) to its frequency domain representation u_hat(k, t). Applying a convolution with function g(x) at time t_1 influences u(x, t) and subsequently affects the evolution of u(x, T) according to the PDE. The final state u(x, T) depends on the original PDE, the initial state u(x, t_1), and the convolution operation."
