  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) representing heat flow in a medium where L is a differential operator. We look at the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) during the evolution.\n\nGiven the evolved system state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T, can we precisely infer the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition may have been transformed by the kernel of \\\\( T(u) \\\\), modifying the feasible distribution of heat. Without knowledge of this application, multiple initial functions could lead to the same state at t = T due to the diffusion process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
