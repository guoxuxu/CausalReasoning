  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. This function models a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane over time t. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function and then examining the implications of manipulations in the frequency domain.\n\nWill applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further manipulation result in a frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the Fourier domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) directly results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the frequency domain, thus showing a straightforward causal relationship from time-domain behavior to frequency-domain representation.",
