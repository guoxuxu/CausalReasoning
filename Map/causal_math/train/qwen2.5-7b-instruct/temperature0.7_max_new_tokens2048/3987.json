  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(w) \\) mapping complex numbers where \\( z(w) \\) is defined as \\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega w} \\), with \\( \\omega \\) being a real constant. We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( Z(v) \\) on \\( z(w) \\), defined by \\( Z(v) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(w) e^{-ivw} dw \\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift transformation \\( G(w) = z(w)e^{ia} \\) (with \\( a \\) being a real constant) is applied before \\( Z(v) \\), will \\( Z(v) \\) still isolate the Fourier component at \\( v \\) without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( G(w) = z(w)e^{ia} \\) adds a constant phase shift \\( a \\) to each frequency component of \\( z(w) \\). While \\( Z(v) \\) will still isolate the component at frequency \\( v \\), it will do so with an altered phase, thus influencing the outcome by shifting the phase of the transformed function.",
