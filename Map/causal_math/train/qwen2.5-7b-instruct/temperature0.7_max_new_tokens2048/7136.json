  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. For this scenario, let's investigate the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined as an integral transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven knowledge of the transformed function \\\\( F(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T, can one determine whether an intervention (Fourier transform) was applied instead of pure evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform alters the function to its frequency spectrum and affects the natural time-domain growth of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the properties of \\\\( F(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T, specifically being a function of frequency components, can be distinctly different from exponential growth, indicating the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform F(z(t)) influences z(t), and the constant ω directly causes changes in z(t) through the differential equation."
