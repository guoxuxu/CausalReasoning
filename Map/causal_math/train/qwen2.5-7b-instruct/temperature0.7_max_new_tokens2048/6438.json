  "Problem": "Consider a system where a temperature field T is modeled by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplace operator. We investigate the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + h(x,t) \\\\), with \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) being a heat source function varying in space and time.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied, the additional heat from \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) might have changed the initial conditions in ways that cannot be traced back uniquely due to the dynamic nature of heat diffusion.",
