  "Problem": "Consider the behaviour of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\), under the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\). Analyze how transformations affect causality in the complex function mapping and their implications on the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform output of a function, can we uniquely identify whether only a scalar intervention or both scalar and frequency adjustments were made, merely by knowing the form of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[z](s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform result of \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(\\\\alpha+i\\\\omega)} \\\\) is ambiguous regarding whether the modifications were purely scaling (\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)), changes in frequency (\\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\)), or both. Without additional constraints or data, identically structured outcomes in the Laplace domain could arise from different combinations of interventions and frequency adjustments.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
