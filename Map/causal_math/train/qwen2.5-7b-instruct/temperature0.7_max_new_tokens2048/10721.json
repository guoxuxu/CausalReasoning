  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. A linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + \\\\alpha z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. We investigate how \\\\( L \\\\) affects the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the initial function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and evolved naturally under the operator \\\\( L \\\\), will \\\\( Lz(t) \\\\) at t = T be different if \\\\( L \\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L \\\\) changes the fundamental behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Specifically, since \\\\( Lz = i\\\\omega e^{i\\\\omega t} + \\\\alpha e^{i\\\\omega t} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha) e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the addition of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) modifies the amplitude and phase, resulting in a different function from the natural evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear operator L to z(t) results in changes to both the derivative of z with respect to time and the scaled version of z, which in turn affect the value of z at time T."
