  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\\\) and its impact on a contour integral over a closed path in the complex plane. Analyze how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z + ai\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit) affects the evaluation of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) around a simple closed contour \\\\(C\\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to modify the contour \\\\(C\\\\) to \\\\(C'\\\\), and then the integral of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is computed around \\\\(C'\\\\), will the value of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_{C'} f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) be the same as the original \\\\(\\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) shifts the contour in the complex plane, which can lead to encompassing or excluding poles that were not originally encompassed or excluded in the initial contour \\\\(C\\\\). Since the residues at these poles contribute to the integral via the residue theorem, moving the contour affects the value of the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) directly causes the contour to change from C to C'; the original contour C influences the value of the integral ∮_C f(z) dz; the integral evaluated along the original contour ∮_C f(z) dz directly causes the value of the integral evaluated along the transformed contour ∮_{C'} f(z) dz."
