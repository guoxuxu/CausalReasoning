  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system represents a basic integral transformation with a complex exponential kernel. We investigate the influence of a matrix multiplier \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we exactly determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any previous time \\\\( t < T \\\\) assuming no intervention was used?",
  "Explanation": "Given that no modification (like matrix multiplication) has been applied, and knowing the continuous and deterministic nature of the integral transformation, we can accurately trace back and compute \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for any \\\\( t < T \\\\) using the inverse of the integral transformation if necessary.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
