  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are functions of time, t, subject to a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) with constant matrices A and B. The function z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = Dz + E \\\\) is applied as an intervention, where D and E are constant matrices, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the matrices A, B, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( U(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further alters the state to a new value modified by D and E, and the resulting state evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) also depends on the initial application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\). Therefore, the final state at T depends on A, B, C, and the subsequent intervention parameters D and E.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
