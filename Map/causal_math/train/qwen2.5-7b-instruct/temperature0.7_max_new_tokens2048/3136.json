  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the wave equation in a one-dimensional domain, defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to the initial conditions.\n\nKnowing only the endpoint Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) and that a speed change intervention occurred, can we determine the exact time or nature of the intervention, such as the new wave speed?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at a given time provides information predominantly about the cumulative effect of the wave dynamics up to that point. It does not, however, uniquely specify when or how the wave speed was changed, as multiple intervention scenarios could lead to similar endpoint states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "c → u(x,t); Fourier transform of initial conditions → u(x,T); intervention (change in c) → Fourier transform of u(k,T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The wave speed directly influences the displacement over time, and an intervention changing the wave speed affects the Fourier transform of the displacement at a given time. The Fourier transform of the initial conditions determines the displacement at a specific time, but knowing only the endpoint Fourier-transformed state and that an intervention occurred does not allow determining the exact time or nature of the intervention."
