  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} F(t) dt \\\\, C \\\\) where C is the contour in the complex plane and F(t) is an analytic function. We are investigating the implications of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\( L[G] \\\\) on \\\\( G(z) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional complex function \\\\( H(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention during the transformation so the new transformation becomes \\\\( L[H \\cdot G] \\\\), will the resulting function solely depend on the transformation properties of \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( H \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(t) \\\\) influences the resultant function, reflecting combined properties of both \\\\( H(t) \\\\) and \\\\( L[G] \\\\). The interaction between \\\\( H(t) \\\\) and \\\\( G(z) \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\) modifies the outcome substantially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a linear operator transformation L to the product of H and G (where G is defined by a complex integral transformation involving an analytic function F) will result in a function that depends on the transformation properties of L and the function H."
