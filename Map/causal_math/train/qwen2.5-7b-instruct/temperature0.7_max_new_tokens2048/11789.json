  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real number. To analyze causal effects, we introduce interventions using the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), is it possible to precisely reconstruct \\\\(z(0)\\\\) without knowing if \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\), it is ambiguous whether the initial condition was modified by \\\\(C\\\\). Depending on the value of \\\\(C\\\\), different initial conditions can yield the same state at \\\\(T\\\\), hence it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\(z(0)\\\\) from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) without this context.",
