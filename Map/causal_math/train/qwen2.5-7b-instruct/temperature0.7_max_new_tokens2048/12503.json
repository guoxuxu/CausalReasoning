  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the following operator equation \\( \\mathcal{L}(x) = D^2x + 2x \\) where \\( D \\) represents the differential operator with respect to variable \\( t \\). Assess how the introduction of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) modifies the system.\n\nBased on the function \\( \\mathcal{G}(x(t)) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\), can we conclusively identify whether the initial transformation applied was \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), or both, by observing \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T > t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformational effects imposed by \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) can interfere in such a way that distinguishing between these or their combination based on \\( x(t) \\) is not clear-cut. The integral transformations can blend the effects making it intricate to deconvolve the original or intermediate sourcing alterations.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The second derivative of x with respect to t (D^2x) directly influences x, and twice the value of x (2x) also directly influences x. Applying the Laplace transform F to x(t) modifies x(t) into F(x(t)), and applying G to F(x(t)) further transforms it into G(x(t))."
