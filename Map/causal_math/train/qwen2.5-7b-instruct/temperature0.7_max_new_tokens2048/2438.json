  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by \\( Ax = b \\), where A is a non-singular matrix. An operator \\( T \\) defined by \\( T(x) = Ux \\) (where \\( U \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied, modifying the vector \\( x \\) in the space.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( x(T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) knowing that \\( T(x) \\) was applied, without additional details about \\( U \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the nature of the matrix \\( U \\), reconstructing the original \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) is not feasible directly as the operation \\( Ux_0 \\) cannot be uniquely inverted without knowing \\( U \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of operator T modifies the original vector x_0 to become x, and observing x after T(x) is applied allows us to infer the effect of T on x_0, though recovering x_0 exactly without knowing U requires additional information."
