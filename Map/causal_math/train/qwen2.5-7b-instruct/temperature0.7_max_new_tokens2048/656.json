  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a(x,t) u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\) is a function describing the velocity at point x and time t. We examine the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i x \\\\xi} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,T)\\\\) at \\\\(T\\\\), can the exact nature of the intervention (changes in \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\)) applied at \\\\(t_1\\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different interventions in the velocity function \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\) could lead to similar alterations in the Fourier transform profile, making it ambiguous. Without additional constraints or data, the specific changes in \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\) resulting in a given \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,T)\\\\) cannot be uniquely reverse-engineered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The velocity function a(x,t) directly causes changes in the partial derivatives u_t and u_x of the function u(x,t); the function u(x,t) directly causes the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi,t)\\) at time t; the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi,T)\\) at time T provides information about the velocity function a(x,t1) at time t1."
