  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. The causal implications are explored by applying a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) to the system.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is set, and the system is allowed to evolve according to its differential equation without any external intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( s \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), and the initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "Given that no external intervention is applied, the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) fully encapsulates the system's evolution based on its initial condition, the constant \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), and the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The linearity and time-invariance of the system under these conditions ensure that the transformed function is solely dependent on these parameters.",
