  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) exactly at t = 0 from the result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) without knowing that transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) involves an integral with an exponential function, it inherently alters and obscures some information about the initial conditions of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\), making it impossible to precisely backtrack to \\\\( z_0(0) \\\\) without specific knowledge of the transformation applied.",
