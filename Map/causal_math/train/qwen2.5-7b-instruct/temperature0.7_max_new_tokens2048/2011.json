  "Problem": "We consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) with complex variable s is applied.\n\nIf we apply a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time T = \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\) and then proceed to T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\), will \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) depend only on the original differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) and not on the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) fundamentally modifies the system's state at T = \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\), changing the basis for subsequent evolution. This square transformation alters the trajectory such that the subsequent evolution to T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) doesn't merely reflect the original \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) equation but now follows a new path initiated by g(z). Thus, the final state at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) reflects both the original and the intervened dynamics.",
