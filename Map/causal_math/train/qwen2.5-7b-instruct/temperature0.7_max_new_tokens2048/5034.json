  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network governed by the Laplace Transform of a complex function \\(\\overline{V}(s) = H(s)\\overline{I}(s)\\), where \\(H(s)\\) represents the system's transfer function and \\(\\overline{V}(s)\\) and \\(\\overline{I}(s)\\) are the Laplace transforms of the voltage and current, respectively. Suppose a filter with a specific impulse response \\( g(t) \\) characterized by its transfer function \\( G(s) \\) is introduced into the network.\n\nCan the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\) be inferred correctly by just examining \\( \\overline{V}(s) \\) and \\( \\overline{I}(s) \\) at \\( s = T \\) without knowing if any filters were temporarily applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\( G(s) \\) was temporarily introduced, it could alter the properties or behavior of \\( \\overline{V}(s) \\) during its active period, leading to potential misinterpretation of \\( H(s) \\) since transient changes could mimic or obscure the actual characteristics of \\( H(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
