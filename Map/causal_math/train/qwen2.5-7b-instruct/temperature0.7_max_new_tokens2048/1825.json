  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = a+bt+ict^2 \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants, and study the application of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are changed to \\\\( a', b', c' \\\\) at t = 0, and the function is allowed to evolve naturally, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) remain identical?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the coefficients \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) alters the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), producing modifications in the time-domain, which directly impact the frequency-domain representation. Thus, the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) will manifest these changes through different frequency components or amplitudes compared to the original.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
