  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We will explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with A being a real constant, influences the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = z(t) + e^{Bt} \\\\) is used (B is another constant), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) additionally influences the trajectory of the function, making the final observed state at time T dependent not only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but also significantly on A and B. The impact of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and the transformation up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) contributes to the compounded effect, making it dependent on multiple constants.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Angular frequency ω determines the behavior of z(t) over time; the transformation g(z) depends on A but does not affect z(T) directly; the intervention h(z) at t_1 introduces B and changes z(t) but z(T) depends on ω alone."
