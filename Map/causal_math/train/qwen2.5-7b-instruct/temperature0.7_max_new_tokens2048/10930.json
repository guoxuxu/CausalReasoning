  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether a transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to reliably trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially since the initial transformation could have altered the trajectory in a way that is not reversibly traceable due to the exponential nature of the transformation.",
