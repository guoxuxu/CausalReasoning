  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\\\overline{z}\\\\), where A and B are constants and \\\\(\\\\overline{z}\\\\) represents the complex conjugate of z. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is also a constant.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 remain unaffected by the previous transformations applications of B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial transformation \\\\( e^{Ct}z \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( e^{Dt}z \\\\) contribute to changes in the trajectory of z. These transformations potentially influence the impact of both A and B in the differential equation, cumulatively affecting the final state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) = e^(Dt)z directly affects z, while the previous transformations f(z) = e^(Ct)z and the constants A and B influence z through the differential equation \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\overline{z}\\). The application of g(z) at time t_1 does not directly affect the impact of A, B, C on z after t_1."
