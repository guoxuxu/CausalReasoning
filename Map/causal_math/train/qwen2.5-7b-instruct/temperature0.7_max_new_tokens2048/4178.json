  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation studied involves the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nKnowing the evolved state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for certain t under the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates over the past values weighted by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega s} \\\\), which blurs distinct initial conditions into a path-dependent integral that cannot be uniquely reversed just from knowing certain points of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
