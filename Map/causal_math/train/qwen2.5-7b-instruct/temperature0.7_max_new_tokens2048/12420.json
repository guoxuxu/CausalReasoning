  "Problem": "In a stochastic process, the change in a variable X is governed by the differential equation \\\\( dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is the drift coefficient, \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is the volatility coefficient, and \\\\( dW_t \\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We study how the application of a transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) impacts the process over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the given stochastic differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( X^2(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( X_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the stochastic differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) alters the initial condition of the process. The square of the initial value, \\\\( X^2_0 \\\\), will follow a different stochastic path due to the non-linear transformation impacting the drift and diffusion terms, leading to a different outcome for \\\\( X^2(t) \\\\) at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in X over time (dX_t) is caused by the drift (μ), volatility (σ), and Wiener process increment (dW_t). Applying the transformation h(X) = X^2 to X_0 at t=0 results in X^2 evolving differently than directly evolving X under the SDE."
