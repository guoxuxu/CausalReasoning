  "Problem": "Investigate the interaction of a discrete dynamic system characterized by the linear mapping equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), in which M is a constant matrix. Consider the transformation induced by the function \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix that acts at a specific moment.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x_N \\\\), can we accurately deduce whether the interventions \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both were used, by solely examining \\\\( x_N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Because linear transformations are involved, different sequences of applying D and E potentially yield the same final state due to matrix properties such as commutation. The final state \\( x_N \\) alone does not uniquely specify which transformations were applied or in what order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly influences the final state x_N through repeated application. The matrix D directly influences the final state x_N at a specific moment."
