  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bx^2 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy - Dy^2 \\\\) where A, B, C, D are constants. We explore the effects of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\), where E is a constant, applied at various points in time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system evolves according to the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under these differential equations to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) initially modifies the state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\) alters the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a trajectory that is fundamentally different at time T than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had simply evolved under the original differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
