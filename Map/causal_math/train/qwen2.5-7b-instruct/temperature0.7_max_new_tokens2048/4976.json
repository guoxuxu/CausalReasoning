  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod varies with time and position, governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider an intervention represented by a heat source term \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) introduced at a position \\\\(x1\\\\) affecting the system.\n\nGiven observation of the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,T)\\\\) at some time \\\\(T\\\\) can we determine uniquely the time and location of the heat source intervention if it was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact characteristics of the intervention, such as the precise time and location of the heat source implementation from the end state \\\\(T(x,T)\\\\), is challenging due to the nature of diffusion obscuring the effects of localized changes, and potentially multiple configurations and timings of heat sources leading to similar distributions at time \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of a heat source S(x1,t) at position x1 directly causes a change in the temperature distribution T(x,t), which in turn determines the temperature observation T(x,T) at a later time T."
