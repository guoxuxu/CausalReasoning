  "Problem": "Consider the application of complex function mapping \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{z} \\\\) in the complex plane and its implications on the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\) defined for \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\\\). The Laplace transform is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{-t} \\\\) at some \\\\( t_0 > 0 \\\\), and we then compute the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will this outcome depend only on the new function and not on the transformation \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\) does not influence the computation of the Laplace transform of the new function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), which solely relies on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) itself. The intervention modifies the function, but the calculation of its Laplace transform remains a separate process uninfluenced by the complex mapping.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying f(t) to g(t) = f(t)e^{-t} changes its Laplace transform from F(s) to G(s), and this change depends on the new function g(t) but not on the complex function mapping w = e^z."
