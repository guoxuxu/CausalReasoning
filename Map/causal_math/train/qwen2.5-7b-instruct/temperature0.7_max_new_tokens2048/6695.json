  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) defined in the complex plane by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's response and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines the effects and causal inferences when the function is modified by a transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a differential operation, say \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\), is introduced at a specific time during the computation of \\\\( z(s) \\\\), will the final result of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) only depend on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not on the transformation \\\\( t^k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a differential operation as an intervention affects both the original function and any transformation applied. Since \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) acts on the product \\\\( t^k \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\), the result depends on how the differentiation interacts with both \\\\( t^k \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\), leading to a final result influenced by the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
