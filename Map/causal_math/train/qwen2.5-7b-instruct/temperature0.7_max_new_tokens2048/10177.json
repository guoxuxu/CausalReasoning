  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of functions over complex domains and examine the impact of an integral transformation. Let \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) be defined on the complex plane minus the origin z = 0 and let an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_{C} f(z) dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is defined without singularity handling and the contour C encloses the origin, does the value of \\\\( T(f) \\\\) change from zero?",
  "Explanation": "When the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is integrated over a closed contour enclosing the origin, it entrains the residue of the function at z = 0. According to the residue theorem, \\\\( T(f) = 2\\\\pi i \\\\), differing from zero, denoting a significant effect caused by the singularity at the origin.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
