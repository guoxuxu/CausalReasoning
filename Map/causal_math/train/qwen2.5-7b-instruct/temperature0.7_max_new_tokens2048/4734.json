  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We are curious about the effect of modifying the function f by a polynomial \\\\( p(t) = t^2 \\\\) before applying the integral transformation.\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) resulting from the integral of \\\\( f(t)t^2 \\\\), can we deduce that the function was indeed modified by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( F(s) \\\\) does not retain explicit traces that unequivocally indicate the application of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) unless specific properties of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) are known. Without such information, identical transformations could arise from different modifications to different functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying the function f(t) by multiplying it with t^2 results in a different F(s), but knowing F(s) does not uniquely determine whether f(t) was originally multiplied by t^2 without additional information."
