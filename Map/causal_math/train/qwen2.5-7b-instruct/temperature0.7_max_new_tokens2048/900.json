  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the evolution is governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = P(z)\\\\), with P being a polynomial in z. Analyze the impact of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) on this system, defined by the function \\\\(g(z, s) = e^{-st}z\\\\) for a complex variable s.\n\nBased on the final state at \\\\(T\\\\), can we unequivocally determine which interventions were applied (specific values of s in \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) and u in h, or possibly others), purely based on the output at \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlap in the effective state outcomes caused by different values of s and u, and the complex interactions with P, it's mathematically infeasible to precisely deduce the history of interventions from the endpoint alone, highlighting the indeterminacy of backward inference in transformative complex dynamical systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of s influences g(z, s), which in turn affects the final state at T. Similarly, the value of u influences h, potentially impacting the system's evolution."
