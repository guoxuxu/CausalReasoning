  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We look at how the Laplace transform affects this function over the variable t, focusing on the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven only the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) after possible interventions on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we determine the initial \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used before any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The information from the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) reflects the current state rather than the historical parameter values. Multiple prior values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could have been modified at different times, leading to the same end transform at \\\\( T \\\\), hence it is not possible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
