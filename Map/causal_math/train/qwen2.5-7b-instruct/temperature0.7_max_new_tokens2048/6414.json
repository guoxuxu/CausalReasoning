  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, is studied.\n\nAfter observing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a specific time t, can we determine whether the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, assuming we started with some \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing just \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not the specific details of the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the transformation makes it impossible to definitively conclude whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied. The evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) alone could yield similar states for different initial conditions influenced by varying constants \\\\( a \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0 directly causes z(t) through the differential equation. The constant a directly causes the transformation f(z). z(t) directly causes f(z) through the application of the transformation."
