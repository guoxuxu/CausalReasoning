  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), will the transformed state at time t be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without applying the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the resulting function by integrating the modified exponential terms. The outcome, \\\\( \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} e^{iA\\\\tau}z_0 d\\\\tau \\\\), is fundamentally different from the original exponential growth rule, as it includes the effects of both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\), and applying the transformation T(z) to z results in a new function that represents the integral impact of z from 0 to t. If z(t) = e^(iAt)z_0, then T(z) applied to z is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\) without the transformation."
