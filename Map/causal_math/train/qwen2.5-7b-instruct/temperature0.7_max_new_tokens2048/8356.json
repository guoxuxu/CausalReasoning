  "Problem": "We analyze a mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) of a mass evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -kx \\), a simple harmonic oscillator, where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. We introduce transformations via \\( f(x) = A \\sin(Bx) \\) at different instances to investigate causal influences.\n\nCan the specific interventions applied (whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both) be inferred precisely by knowing only the observed state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\( x(T) \\), distinguishing which transformations or sequences of transformations were applied proves complicated due to the multiple potential trajectories converging to the same final state. This stems from the complex effects introduced by the interplay of the nonlinear transformations \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial position and velocity of the mass (represented by x(t)) directly influence its position at time T (x(T)). The constant k determines the frequency of oscillation and thus indirectly affects x(t) and x(T)."
