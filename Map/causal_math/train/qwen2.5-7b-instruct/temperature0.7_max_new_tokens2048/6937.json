  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially without further transformation, does this affect the time-domain representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is altered fundamentally?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is a linear and reversible operation affecting only the frequency domain representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The time-domain behavior of the system, described by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), remains dictated by the differential equations without alteration by the transformation.",
