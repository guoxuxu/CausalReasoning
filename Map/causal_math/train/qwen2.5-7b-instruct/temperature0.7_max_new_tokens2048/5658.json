  "Problem": "Imagine a functional transformation governed by the integral operator \\\\( L[\\\\varphi(x)] = \\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty K(t, x) \\\\varphi(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, x) \\\\) is a specific kernel function and \\\\( \\\\varphi(x) \\\\) represents the initial density. We are assessing how initial alterations, involving a complex function \\\\( f(x) = e^{ax} \\\\), where a is a complex number, and subsequent transformations impact this system.\n\nIf we observe the result of \\\\( L[\\\\varphi(x)] \\\\) at some point, can we conclusively infer the original form of \\\\( \\\\varphi(x) \\\\) or the use of \\\\( f(x) = e^{ax} \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the outcome of the integral transformation, it's impossible to determine uniquely whether the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( \\\\varphi(x) \\\\). The exponential modification due to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and its integration through \\\\( L \\\\) could yield results indistinguishable from other potential modifications or none at all, especially without specifics about \\\\( K(t, x) \\\\) or \\\\( a \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel function K(t, x) and the initial density φ(x) together determine the transformed function L[φ(x)]. The complex number a influences the function f(x) = e^(ax), which is used in the transformation process. Therefore, observing L[φ(x)] can provide information about both K(t, x) and φ(x), but without additional data, it may not be possible to conclusively infer the exact original form of φ(x) or the specific value of a."
