  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. Assume an external transformation is defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{wt}z \\\\), where w is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to deduce the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately. The initial state could have been altered by the transformation \\\\( e^{wt} \\\\), which affects the subsequent evolution according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\). Without knowing the parameter \\\\( w \\\\), the effect of time scaling cannot be reversed.",
