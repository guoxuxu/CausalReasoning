  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system governed by the equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a matrix defining system dynamics, B is a matrix defining input effects, x is the state vector, and u is the control input. We examine the system under the influence of a control transformation defined by \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time t = 0 an initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is set, and the input u follows \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\) without further changes in strategy, will the state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T necessarily reflect solely the dynamics formulated by matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The feedback transformation \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\) affects the evolution of the state vector. As the input u is a function of the current state x, modified by K, the resulting system dynamics are represented by \\\\( dx/dt = (A+BK)x \\\\), thus altering the trajectory from what would be determined solely by A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(0) → x(T); A → dx/dt; B → dx/dt; K → u; u → dx/dt",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state vector x(0) influences the state vector x(T) through the system dynamics matrix A. The matrices B and K indirectly affect dx/dt via u, but with the given control transformation u(t) = Kx(t), the primary driver of change in x is A."
