  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v\\\\cdot\\\\nabla u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the state of the system and \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant velocity vector. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) is studied to determine its effect over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_0)\\\\) is implemented on the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\), then the system evolves according to the given PDE without further intervention. Will the state \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\) at time T be the same as if the untransformed \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was evolved to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform as an initial condition alters the spatial frequency components of \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\), and hence the derived solution \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) will differ significantly. The evolution as per the PDE respects these initial frequencies, therefore leading to a distinct state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0(x) directly influences the state u(t,x) at time t, and applying the Fourier transform to u_0(x) results in F(u_0) which also directly influences u(t,x). Consequently, whether the Fourier transform is applied to the initial condition or not, the state u(T,x) at time T is determined by the evolution of u(t,x) under the given PDE."
