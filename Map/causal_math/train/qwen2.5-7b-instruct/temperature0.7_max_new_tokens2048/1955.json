  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\) applied at different instances.\n\nIf halfway through an observation time, a matrix transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the system altering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\), will the final Laplace transform \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\) solely reflect the natural dynamics given by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of matrix \\\\( M \\\\) introduces a new dynamic to the components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus altering the resultant Laplace transform. The transformed function \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) will not only reflect the dynamics by A and B but also the effect of M, which modifies both magnitude and direction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "M → Mz(t); x(t) → z(t); y(t) → z(t); A → x(t); B → y(t); z(t) → L[z](s)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying matrix transformation M to z(t) changes its form; A and B determine the dynamics of x(t) and y(t) respectively, which compose z(t); the Laplace transform L[z](s) of z(t) reflects the dynamics governed by A and B before the transformation M."
