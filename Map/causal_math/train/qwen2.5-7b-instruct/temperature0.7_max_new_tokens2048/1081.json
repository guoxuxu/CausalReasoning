  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\. Over time, the function describes a circular trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governs the behavior of the complex number \\\\( x \\\\) over time, and there is no external intervention, will the magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remain constant over time?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) represents a rotation in the complex plane, the magnitude of \\\\( x \\\\) remains unchanged. The transformation \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) only affects the angle of \\\\( x \\\\) by rotating it, and does not change its magnitude.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The magnitude of z(t) remains constant because it is determined solely by the initial magnitude of x and the exponential term, which only rotates x without changing its magnitude."
