  "Problem": "Consider a damped harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping and angular frequency parameters, respectively. Let's analyze the effect of a transformation on the initial conditions by applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x_0e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via a new function \\\\( h(x) = x_1e^{-\\\\mu t} \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is a constant) is applied, will this completely override the effects of the initial transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) by the time t = T (> t_1)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) will not entirely override the effects of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) as both transformations will interact in the dynamics of the system. The resulting system state at time T will depend on the interactions of both transformations along with the inherent system dynamics, creating a superposition mix of the effects influenced by \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\), and the natural system parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of function g(x) at the initial state influences the system's behavior until t1, after which the application of function h(x) at t1 can alter the system's trajectory, potentially overriding the effects of g(x) by time T if the parameters and timing align appropriately."
