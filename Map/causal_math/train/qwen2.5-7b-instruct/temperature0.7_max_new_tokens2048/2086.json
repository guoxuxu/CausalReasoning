  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) periodically, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) was applied, there is indeterminacy in determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because both the linear transformation and nonlinear dynamics could modify the state in multiple ways, leading to non-unique possibilities for \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The imaginary unit times omega (iω) and the constant k directly cause the rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt); z directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt); the transformation f(z) maps to the state of z at time t (z(t)); the state of z at time t maps to the observed value of z at time T (z(T))."
