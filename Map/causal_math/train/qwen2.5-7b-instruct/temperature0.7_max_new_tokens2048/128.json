  "Problem": "Imagine an electrical circuit consisting of series RLC components (Resistor, Inductor, and Capacitor) where the transfer function H(s) in the Laplace domain represents the relation between the input voltage and the output current. The circuit dynamics are affected by the introduction of a complex impedance Z(s) = s/(s^2 + s + 1), which modifies H(s).\n\nGiven the final output current at time t, can we determine precisely which impedances were integrated (whether Z(s), Z'(s), or both), only by knowing the behavior of the output current?",
  "Explanation": "The final output current could result from various combinations of interventions (Z(s), Z'(s), or both). Due to the nature of superposition in linear systems and the changes in the overall transfer function, it is not possible to uniquely identify the interventions from the output current alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The impedance Z(s) and Z'(s) both affect the transfer function H(s), which in turn influences the output current."
