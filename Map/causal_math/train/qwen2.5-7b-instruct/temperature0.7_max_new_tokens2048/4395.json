  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\), on the evolution of the system over time.\n\nIf at time t = t1, a transformation \\\\(x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\), where M is another linear operator, is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t1 be exclusively determined by the operator L and not influenced by the Fourier transform or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator M introduces additional dynamics to the system, and the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(x_0)\\\\) also influences the system's state. Hence, the end state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) would be dependent on L, M, and the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
