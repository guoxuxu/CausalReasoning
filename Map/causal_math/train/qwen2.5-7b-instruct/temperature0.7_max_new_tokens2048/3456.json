  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of applying an initial temperature distribution using the transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing the temperature distribution at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we definitively trace whether the intervention \\\\( u(x, t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\) or some other intervention was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), based solely on the observed distribution at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature at time \\\\( T \\\\) is a result of diffusive blending and may resemble distributions achievable through various interventions. Given that different interventions might have similar effects over time due to the smoothing nature of the heat equation, it's impossible to definitively identify specific interventions applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) just based on the distribution observed at \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x, 0) and the thermal diffusivity alpha directly cause the temperature distribution u(x, t) at any time t. The parameter beta influences u(x, t) through the initial condition. An intervention u(x, t_1) may alter the temperature distribution u(x, T) at a later time T."
