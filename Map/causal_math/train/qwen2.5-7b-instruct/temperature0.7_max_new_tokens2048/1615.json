  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a spatially varying coefficient. The impact of the initial transformation by Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[u(x,0)](s) \\\\) is studied over time t.\n\nIf an intervention by a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x,t_1)](\\\\xi) \\\\) (where t_1 < T) is applied, will the endpoint u(x,T) for T > t_1 be independent of the intervention's effects?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform applied as an intervention alters the representation and potentially the boundary conditions or system state at time t_1. Therefore, the solution u(x,T) will likely reflect the influence of both the initial conditions transformed by the Laplace transform and the intervention by the Fourier transform, dependent on how these transformations interact with the system dynamics defined by the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The spatially varying coefficient a(x) influences the spatial derivative ∂u/∂x, which in turn affects the evolution of u(x,t) over time. The initial condition u(x,0) influences the temporal derivative ∂u/∂t, driving the change in u(x,t). Applying a Fourier transform at t_1 does not directly affect the endpoint u(x,T) for T > t_1, as the PDE solution is determined by the initial and boundary conditions."
