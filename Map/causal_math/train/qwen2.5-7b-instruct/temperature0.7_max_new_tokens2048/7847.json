  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Let \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition and \\\\( F(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, represents an integral transformation applied to \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( G(u) = e^{Nt}u \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ongoing state of \\\\( u \\\\) at any time, especially post-intervention, relies not only on the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) but also deeply on the transformations introduced by \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\). Because these transformations alter the evolution at specific instances, the final state at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) encapsulates effects from both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) and the differential operator L determine u(x, t). The matrices M and N influence u(x, t) at specific times but do not affect the subsequent evolution governed solely by L. Therefore, u(x, T) depends on L and u(x, t_1), which in turn is influenced by M and N."
