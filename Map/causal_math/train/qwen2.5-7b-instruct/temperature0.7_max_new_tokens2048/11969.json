  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem associated with the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space. The operator is defined by the differential equation \\\\(L[u] = -y'' + q(x)y \\\\) on the interval \\\\([0, 1]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(y(0) = y(1) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q(x)\\\\) is a potential function.\n\nGiven the observed eigenvalues \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), can we uniquely determine if a change in the potential function from \\\\(q(x)\\\\) to \\\\(q'(x)\\\\) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple potential functions can potentially lead to the same set of eigenvalues due to the non-uniqueness and possible isospectral potentials. Without additional information, the original potential function cannot be precisely deduced from eigenvalues alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A change in the potential function q(x) affects the linear operator L[u], which in turn influences the observed eigenvalues λ. Similarly, a change in the potential function to q'(x) would affect the operator to L'[u'], influencing the eigenvalues accordingly."
