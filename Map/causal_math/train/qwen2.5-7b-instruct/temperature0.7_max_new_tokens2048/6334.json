  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The role of the Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) on this system is analyzed.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the constants \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) in the original differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the algebraic form of the Laplace transform of the differential equation. The function's s-domain form directly depends on these parameters, allowing their values to be extracted by evaluating the relations given by the transformed equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time-domain function z(t) directly causes its derivative dz/dt; iωz + k directly causes dz/dt; z(t) undergoes Laplace transformation to become L(z)(s); L(z)(s) indirectly reflects ω and k through the transformed form of the differential equation."
