  "Problem": "Consider a functional space where functions are transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\), which represents the Laplace transform. The initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and its transform are studied over different conditions and manipulations of variable x.\n\nKnowing the result of the Laplace transform of some function at x, and knowing that an intervention in the form of a function additive was applied, can we determine both the original function and the intervention function uniquely?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linear properties of the Laplace transform, multiple combinations of original functions and interventions (additive modifications) might yield the same transform result. Additional information about either the initial function or the intervention is required to uniquely determine both components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform T[f](x) of a function f(t) is influenced by the function f(t), and an intervention can alter T[f](x). Knowing T[f](x) and an intervention does not uniquely determine both f(t) and the intervention function."
