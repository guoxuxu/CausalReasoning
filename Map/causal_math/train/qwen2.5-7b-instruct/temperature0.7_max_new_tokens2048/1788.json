  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in the domain describing a physical system. The transformation is defined by an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( v(x) = (T u)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} U(x, y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\), and aware of an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine what transformations (\\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) were applied, just by analyzing \\\\( v(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of different kernel functions and the potentially similar results they can produce under the operator \\\\( A \\\\), it is challenging to precisely attribute the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) to specific transformations. The interactions between the kernels and the operator may yield indistinguishable outcomes, making accurate backward inference difficult.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x) → v(x); T → v(x); U(x, y) → v(x); intervention at t_1 → transformation determination",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x) is transformed into v(x) through the integral transform T using kernel U(x, y). An intervention at t_1 can influence the transformation process leading to determining which transformations (T, S, or both) were applied based on the final state v(x)."
