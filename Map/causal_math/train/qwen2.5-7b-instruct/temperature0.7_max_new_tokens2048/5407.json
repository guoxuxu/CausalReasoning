  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where heat transfer can be modeled using a differential equation involving a Laplace Transform, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t, x)\\}\\\\), which corresponds to the temperature \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) distributed over a rod of length L. Let's assume the rod has an initial temperature distribution described by \\\\( u(0, x) = f(x) \\\\), and the heat evolution is given by the transformation \\\\( g(t, x) = e^{-kt} \\\\) due to cooling effects, where k is a heat dissipation constant.\n\nIf an additional cooling effect described by \\\\( h(t, x) = e^{-ct} \\\\) (where c is a new cooling constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on k and not on c?",
  "Explanation": "The additional cooling intervention with \\\\( h(t, x) \\\\) introduces a different rate of temperature decay, influencing the ultimate distribution across the rod. Therefore, the final temperature profile at T is affected by both cooling constants k and c, altering the system's dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(0, x) and the heat dissipation constant k directly cause the temperature distribution u(T, x) at any later time T. The cooling constant c does not affect u(T, x) once the additional cooling effect starts at t_1."
