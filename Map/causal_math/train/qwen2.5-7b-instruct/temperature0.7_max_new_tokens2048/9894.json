  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) is determined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\), where S is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\) where K is another constant complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\), we lack crucial information about the transformation \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\). This uncertainty makes it impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(z_0\\\\) as multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depending on the action of K.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of S determines the rate of change of z, the initial value z_0 evolves over time to become z(T), the constant K transforms z through f(z), and this transformation affects the observed value of z(t)."
