  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the scenario where the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is applied, with N also being a complex matrix.\n\nIf we introduce an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) via another function \\\\( j(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where Q is another complex matrix), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( j(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds a new dynamics into the system. The final state at time T is not only dependent on the original matrix M but also significantly influenced by both N and Q due to the multiple exponential transformations that interact dynamically and are typically non-commutative.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
