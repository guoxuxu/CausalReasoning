  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x) \\) defined in the complex plane, where \\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\). We are interested in the mappings done by \\( \\phi(z) = z^2 \\) and explore how these transformations affect \\( z \\) as \\( x \\) varies along the real axis.\n\nIf \\( \\phi(z) \\) is applied to \\( f(x_0) \\) where \\( x_0 \\) is a real number, and then \\( x \\) evolves to \\( x_1 \\) under the transformation \\( f(x) \\) without any intervention, will \\( z(x_1) \\) at \\( x_1 \\) remain as \\( \\phi(f(x_0)) \\) was initially?",
  "Explanation": "The square function \\( \\phi(z) \\) transforms \\( z \\) at \\( x_0 \\) independently of how \\( x \\) evolves to \\( x_1 \\). The effect of \\( f(x) \\) evolving \\( x \\) to \\( x_1 \\) and then applying \\( \\phi \\) would give a different result since \\( \\phi(f(x_1)) \\neq \\phi(f(x_0)) \\) unless \\( x_0 = x_1 \\). The transformation \\( f(x) \\) and the squaring function \\( \\phi \\) do not commute in general.",

  "causal_map_integration": "As x evolves from x_0 to x_1, f(x) changes accordingly, transforming z, which then undergoes the transformation φ(z) based on its initial value φ(f(x_0)). The value of z at x_1, φ(f(x_1)), does not necessarily remain equal to φ(f(x_0)) unless x_1 = x_0."
