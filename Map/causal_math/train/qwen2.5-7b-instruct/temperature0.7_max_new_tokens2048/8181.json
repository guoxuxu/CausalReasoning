  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\). We are examining the effects of a subsequent operation using the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of a modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) right after applying the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), will the resulting transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) differ from directly applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with parameter \\\\( s-a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace Transform to \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( L(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{at} f(t) e^{-st} dt = L(s-a) \\\\) of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Thus, transforming \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or directly adjusting the Laplace Transform parameter of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( s-a \\\\) yields the same result.",
