  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the effect of performing a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) given by \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\), and analyze how transformations affect the function over time and complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a particular frequency, can we determine precisely what interventions (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( H \\\\), or both) were used, by knowing only the value of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "End state transformations like \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) arising after multiple layered operations including \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( H \\\\) might converge to similar outcomes for diverse initial settings or intervention strategies. Specifically, overlapping effects in the complex frequency domain obscure the direct inference of particular interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant complex matrix M directly influences the rate of change of z(t), z(t) is transformed by the Laplace transform L to produce Z(s), and applying the Laplace transform L to z(t) results in Z(s)."
