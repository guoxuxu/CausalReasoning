  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F[z] = \\\\int e^{iBt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) over time interval [0, T], where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional transformation, \\\\( G[z] = \\\\int e^{iCt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the interval [0, T], will the final outcome of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be independent of the interplay between \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G[z] \\\\) as an intervention introduces another layer of transformation, intertwining the effects of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). The final state of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations, reflecting compound effects from both matrices and their interaction over the integral paths.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrices A, B, and C respectively determine z(t), F[z], and G[z]. The application of G[z] does not directly influence F[z] because they are defined over different transformations and intervals, making the final outcome of F[z] independent of the interplay between B and C."
