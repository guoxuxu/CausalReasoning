  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. An intervention is applied via a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(t)\\\\), with h(t) representing a controlled input function.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine whether the function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was added at some earlier time without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the use of \\\\(h(t)\\\\) or additional data points, it's impossible to distinguish whether changes in \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) resulted from natural evolution under L or due to the intervention. Both scenarios could lead to similar outcomes, depending on the characteristics of L and h.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(t) directly influences u(x,T) through the transformation g(u) = u + h(t), and the operator L(u) also directly influences u(x,T) through the partial differential equation."
