  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}\\) where \\(f(t)\\) is a time-domain representation and \\(F(s)\\) is its frequency-domain representation. The effect of an impulse response function \\(h(t)\\) on \\(f(t)\\), transformed as \\(H(s)\\), is analyzed through its impact on \\(F(s)\\).\n\nIf an impulse response \\( h(t) \\) is convolved with \\( f(t) \\) and then transformed to frequency domain as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t) * f(t)\\} \\), will this transformation result in a product of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( F(s) \\) as per convolution theorem?",
  "Explanation": "According to the convolution theorem, the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Laplace transforms. Therefore, \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t) * f(t)\\} = H(s)F(s) \\), showing that the transformation directly results in multiplying the transforms of \\( h(t) \\) and \\( f(t) \\).",
