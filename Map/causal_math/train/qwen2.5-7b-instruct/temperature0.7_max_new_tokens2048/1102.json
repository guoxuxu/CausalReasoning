  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are matrices. This system is affected by applying an integration transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int z(t) dt \\\\). We assess how the system behaves with or without this transformation, and how interventions could influence results over time.\n\nGiven observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we deduce the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), we cannot accurately trace back to the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The integration process could mask or modify the influences of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), making it ambiguous to deduce the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) directly influences z(t), which in turn determines z(T). The transformation h(z) affects z(t), but knowing z(T) alone does not allow us to deduce z(0) without additional information about whether h(z) was applied."
