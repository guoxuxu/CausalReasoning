  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output state z depends on the input state x through the transformation given by z = Sx, where S is a complex transformation matrix. We consider the influence of multiplying complex eigenvalues in the matrix S analyzed over variable changes.\n\nIf an intervention occurs by adding an additional constant matrix K to S after the eigenvalue multiplication by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), will the system's output z only be influenced by the modified matrix \\\\( \\\\lambda S \\\\) and not by the intervention K?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of matrix K as an intervention after scaling S by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) changes both the nature and result of the linear transformation, directly affecting the output z. Thus, both \\\\( \\\\lambda S \\\\) and K influence the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original matrix S transforms the input state x to produce the output state z. Adding the constant matrix K modifies the matrix to λS, but the output z is determined solely by the transformed matrix λS, not by the intervention K."
