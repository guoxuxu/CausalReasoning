  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the Fourier Transform of the derivative of \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\), can we specify which operations (multiplication by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), the original signal, or differentiation) were applied without additional context?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of the derived signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) encapsulates the effects of both the exponential decay and the differentiation, intertwined in a way that loses the individual distinctions of each operation. Without explicit information about the sequence and nature of operations employed, it's impossible to parse them out solely from the final Fourier spectrum.",
