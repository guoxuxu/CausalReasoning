  "Problem": "Assume we have a function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\). Also, suppose an integral transformation of this function using a contour in the complex plane specified as \\\\(T[f(z)] = \\\\int_C f(z) dz\\\\) where C is a semicircular contour from -R to R in the upper half-plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is initially determined by \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\) without any modifications and is integrated over the contour C, will its transformation \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\) be affected by altering the radius R of the contour C?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the radius R of the contour C affects the values of z squared, thus changing the function \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\) over different points along the path. This directly impacts the result of the integral transformation, showing a clear cause (change in R) to effect (alteration in \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\)) relation.",
