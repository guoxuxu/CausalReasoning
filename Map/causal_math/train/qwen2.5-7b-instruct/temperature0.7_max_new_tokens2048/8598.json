  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation given by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. We explore the effect of an integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) \\\\) at some later time t without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The determination of the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) \\\\) requires inverse transformation and knowledge of the entire evolution (or additional conditions such as specific boundary conditions or simplifications), which typically isn't feasible solely from the transformed data at a later time.",
