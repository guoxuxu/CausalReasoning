  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where functions are transformed by Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We explore how integrating these transformations affects the plane's structures, examining the impact of tweaking the function by a constant linear shift \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\) where c is a real number.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) in the form \\\\( G(s) = F(s) + \\\\frac{c}{s} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the constant \\\\( c \\\\) used for the shift without extra information?",
  "Explanation": "While you can infer that a shift occurred and even determine the magnitude of the shift, \\\\( \\\\frac{c}{s} \\\\), the exact values of \\\\( c \\\\) and the uniqueness of the corresponding \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be determined without additional constraints or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A constant linear shift in the time domain function f(t) results in an additional term \\\\(\\\\frac{c}{s}\\\\) in its Laplace transform G(s), and the original function f(t) can be recovered from its Laplace transform F(s) if the shift constant c is known."
