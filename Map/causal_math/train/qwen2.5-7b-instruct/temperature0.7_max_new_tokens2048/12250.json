  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system's state over time t. Let's analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) on this complex function.\n\nIf an intervention by modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + t^2 \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) for s < 1 only depend on the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), ignoring the added \\\\( t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by adding \\\\( t^2 \\\\), which affects the Laplace transform of the entire function. Since the Laplace transform is sensitive to any changes in the domain function, both the original and intervened parts contribute to the output for any value of s, including s < 1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying z(t) to include t^2 after t_0 will change F(s), but for s < 1, F(s) will still depend on the original form of z(t) because the Laplace transform of t^2 does not affect lower s values significantly in isolation."
