  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We review the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), and how it translates to solve the equation in the transformed domain.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the system's state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the intervention with \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) as an intervention can alter the evolution dictated by \\\\( L \\\\). The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( L \\\\) and the effects of the new operator \\\\( M \\\\), reflecting the compounded influence of both operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of operator M at time t_1 directly influences the state u, and the evolution of u over time (described by u_t) depends on the operator L but not on subsequent interventions with M."
