  "Problem": "We postulate a scenario involving the Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(t) \\) and its effect when used in conjunction with an integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, applied to a function \\( h(t) \\) that represents a physical system's response.\n\nIf an intervention via convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) happens after \\( h(t) \\) is convoluted with \\( \\delta(t) \\) but before the application of the Laplace Transform, does the resulting transform solely represent the effect of \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\( g(t) \\) as an intervention changes the combined function to \\( g(t) * h(t) \\) where * denotes convolution. Consequently, the Laplace Transform will represent this new convoluted function and not merely the effect of \\( h(t) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Dirac delta function δ(t) directly affects h(t), which then undergoes convolution with another function g(t) before being transformed by the Laplace Transform. The resulting transform reflects the combined effects of h(t) and g(t)."
