  "Problem": "Analyze the causal dynamics in a control system where the output \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = Kx(t) + Du(t) \\\\), with \\\\(x(t)\\\\) as the state vector evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\), and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) as the control input. The matrices A, B, K, D are constant. Consider the effect of a transformation \\\\( v(t) = Ce^{Lt}u(t) \\\\) applied to the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\), where C and L are also constant matrices.\n\nUsing the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the exact sequence of transformations from the original input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) (whether \\\\( v(t) \\\\), \\\\( w(t) \\\\), or both were applied) only by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that different sequences of transformations can lead to complex interactions between the inputs and system dynamics, and they can yield similar or even the same outputs under certain conditions, it is not possible to uniquely distinguish from the output which transformations were applied or in which order. The matrix operations involved do not allow for a unique inversion to retrieve the exact sequence of input modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t) directly influences the state vector x(t) and the output z(t). The transformation v(t) = Ce^{Lt}u(t) indirectly affects x(t) and z(t) through its impact on u(t)."
