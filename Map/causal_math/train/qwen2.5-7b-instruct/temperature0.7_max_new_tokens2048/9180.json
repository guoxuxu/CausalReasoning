  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nWith known endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine both the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) only by knowing the dynamics \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) and endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) or additional constraints, it is impossible to uniquely specify what transformations were applied at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) could produce the same endpoint due to the properties of complex multiplication.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time T directly influences the endpoint z(T). The parameter A directly causes the evolution of z(t) over time. The initial state x directly causes the value of z(t) at any time t. The transformation B directly influences the function f(z). The endpoint z(T) directly influences the determination of the transformation f(z)."
