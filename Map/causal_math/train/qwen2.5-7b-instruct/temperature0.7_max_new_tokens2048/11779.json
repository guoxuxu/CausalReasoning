  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time linear system controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Consider the application of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nx} \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, and study its effects over time.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively ascertain what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) by simply examining \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that multiple function transformations might end up producing similar or even indistinguishable endpoints, it is virtually impossible to unambiguously determine the exact sequence and type of interventions based solely on the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The overlapping effects of N and Q through their transformative impacts make specific intervention identification infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of matrix M to state x results in the rate of change of x over time. The function h(x) transforms x into e^(Nx), and the final state x(T) is the result of these transformations over time."
