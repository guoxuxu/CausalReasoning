  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined over the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}s \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The transformation by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf we modify the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t + Bt}s \\\\) at a specific point, say \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant, will \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at T solely depend on \\\\( A \\\\) regardless of \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the introduction of an additional term \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) at \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\), the resulting function is altered from that point onwards. The transformed outcome \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) because the integral calculation will reflect the exponential influence of \\\\( B \\\\) added at \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\).",
