  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Hx\\\\), where H is a constant matrix. The effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix, is investigated.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be determined unambiguously without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, it is not possible to determine if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Dx_0 \\\\) was the actual initial condition. This ambiguity arises because both scenarios could lead to the same or different observations at t = T, depending on the properties of D and H.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
