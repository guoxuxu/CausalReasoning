  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is an input function. We study how manipulations through a specific function \\\\( g(x) = x + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, influence the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the integral of \\\\( K(T, s) \\\\) over \\\\( s \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine how much of the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is due to the original function \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) and how much is due to the constant shift introduced by \\\\( c \\\\). There could be many combinations of \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) producing the same output.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial input function x_0(s) directly influences the output y(T) through the integral transformation. Applying the function g(x) to x_0(s) changes x_0(s) to x_0(s) + c, which then influences y(T)."
