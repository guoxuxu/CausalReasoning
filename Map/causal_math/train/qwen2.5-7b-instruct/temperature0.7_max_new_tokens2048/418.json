  "Problem": "Let's examine the role of a control function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in determining the solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + x\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(x, T) = \\\\sin(x - T)\\\\) at time T, is it possible to uniquely determine that the initial condition was \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(x)\\\\) without knowing how the equation was solved?",
  "Explanation": "Based on the backward characteristic of the equation and the linear nature of the drift terms, seeing \\\\(u(x, T) = \\\\sin(x - T)\\\\) uniquely allows us to compute backward to find \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(x)\\\\), even without explicit knowledge of the intermediate solving process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
