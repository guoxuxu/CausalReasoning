  "Problem": "We investigate the influence of a function transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + v \\\\) within the context of a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant complex number and v is a constant complex transformation vector.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolved under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the function value \\\\( g(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T match the function value had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) been evolved directly under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial argument by squaring \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and adding vector v which changes the trajectory of the evolution under \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Since squaring and shifting a complex number changes its modulus and argument, \\\\( g(z(t)) \\\\) will yield different results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving it under g(z) to t=T results in g(f(z_0)), which may differ from directly evolving z_0 under g(z) to t=T."
