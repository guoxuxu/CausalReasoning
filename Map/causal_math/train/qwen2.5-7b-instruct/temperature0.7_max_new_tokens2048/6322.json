  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions with specific transformations applied.\n\nGiven the value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some \\\\( T > 0 \\\\), can we specifically identify the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without further information about the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the trajectory depends on the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) which define the growth/decay rate and the rotation speed respectively, knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) unless \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
