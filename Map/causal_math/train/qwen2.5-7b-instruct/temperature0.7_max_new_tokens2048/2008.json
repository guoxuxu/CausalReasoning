  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = M\\\\mathbf{x}(t)\\\\), where M is a constant 2x2 matrix. Explore the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the system, where the Laplace transform of a vector function is applied component-wise.\n\nGiven a final observed state \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine which specific transformations (including linear or non-linear) were applied during the interval from 0 to T, based solely on the known endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied during the evolution involves having to distill multiple possibilities that could result in the same \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\). Without additional constraints or information about the transformations (whether they were linear transformations like \\\\(M\\\\) or involved non-linearities like \\\\(g\\\\)), it is not possible to uniquely identify the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly causes the state vector x(t), the initial state x(0) directly causes the state x(t), time t directly causes the state x(t), the Laplace transform of x(t) directly causes X(s), and the state at time T directly causes X(s), while M also directly causes X(s)."
