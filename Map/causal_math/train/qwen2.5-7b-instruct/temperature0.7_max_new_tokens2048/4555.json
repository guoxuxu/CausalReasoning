  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, and analyze its behavior under the integral transform \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i \\\\eta \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time a modification is made such that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) becomes \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i \\\\omega + a) t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, will the integral transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) be independent of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the term \\\\( a \\\\) affects the exponential decay rate in \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which directly influences the convergence behavior and outcome of the integral transform. The result of \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) becomes sensitive not only to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but now also significantly to \\\\( a \\\\), whereby \\\\( a \\\\) affects both the convergence condition and the resulting transformed function's form.",
