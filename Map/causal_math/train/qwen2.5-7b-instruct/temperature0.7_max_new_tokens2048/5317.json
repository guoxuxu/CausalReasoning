  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iωt}\\\\) where \\\\(ω\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a transformation by applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). Further, at a later time, an external operator applies \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z_0 = e^{iω0} \\\\), resulting in \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), and then the system is let to evolve without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Initial square mapping transforms \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), effectively changing the frequency of oscillation from \\\\( ω \\\\) to \\\\( 2ω \\\\). This results in a different trajectory with elevated frequency, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0 directly influences z_0^2 through squaring, and z_0 also directly influences z(T) through the evolution equation. z_0^2 indirectly influences z(T) through the squaring operation followed by evolution, but this path is equivalent to the direct path from z_0 to z(T) given the form of the function."
