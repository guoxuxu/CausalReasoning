  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on a linear algebra operation where \\\\( z \\\\) is mapped under \\\\( A \\\\), a square matrix. The transformation is given by the matrix exponential \\\\( h(A) = e^{A} \\\\). We explore how these transformations interact and evolve over time.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t \\\\), an intervention applies a new function \\\\( p(B) = e^{B} \\\\) to the system, where \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant matrix distinct from \\\\( A \\\\), does the resulting matrix solely depend on the interplay of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) and ignore the initial scalar transformation \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( p(B) \\\\) does not erase the effect of \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\). Instead, it adds another layer of complexity. The final state of the system is influenced by both the initial transformation \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\) and the properties and relations between \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The exponential nature of these transformations integrates the impacts from all previous states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix exponential h depends directly on the input matrix (A → h(A) and B → h(B)), while the initial scalar transformation g(z) influences z, which is then mapped under A or B to produce h(A) or h(B). Introducing p(B) does not negate the effects of g(z) if z is initially transformed under A before applying p(B)."
