  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of matrices within a linear differential equation system described by \\\\( \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where M is a matrix. Consider the influence of a linear transformation defined by the matrix P, applied as \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(0) = P\\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nIf an intervention represented by another linear transformation \\\\( Q \\\\) is applied at time t1, will the state at a later time t2 depend solely on the matrix M and not on P or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix Q introduces additional impact on the original trajectory, resulting in a state at time t2 that depends not just on the matrix M but also on the interplay between P, Q, and M. The state at t2 is a function of both transformations and their timing relative to the system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The stability of the matrix M determines the state at time t2. The initial condition P influences the state at time t1, which then influences the state at time t2. An intervention Q at time t1 also influences the state at time t1, which in turn influences the state at time t2. However, the direct dependence of the state at time t2 on the matrix M remains unchanged."
