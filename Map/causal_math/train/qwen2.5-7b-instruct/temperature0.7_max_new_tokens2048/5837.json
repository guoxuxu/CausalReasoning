  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\). We explore the impact of transforming the variable \\\\(u\\\\) using a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a value \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T differ from the evolution of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( u_0 + k \\\\). The nonlinear nature of the equation means that solutions depend sensitively on initial conditions. This shift results in a different trajectory, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(u) → u changes the initial value u_0 to u_0 + k, which then evolves according to the differential equation u → u(T). This change in the initial condition can lead to a different u(T) compared to the evolution of u_0 directly under the same differential equation."
