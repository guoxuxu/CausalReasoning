  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{L}u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a function of both space and time, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on the system and querying causality with and without intervention.\n\nObserving the Fourier transformed system state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(t, k)\\\\) at time t, can one uniquely determine the initial Fourier-transformed state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(0, k)\\\\) assuming no knowledge of intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and time-invariant nature of the operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) in the Fourier domain, knowing the state at any time allows the unique determination of the initial conditions in the transformed \\\\(k\\\\)-space by reverse applying the exponential solution of the transformed differential equation.",
