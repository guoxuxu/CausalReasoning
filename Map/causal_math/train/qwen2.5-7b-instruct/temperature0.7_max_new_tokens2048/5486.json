  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. This system is influenced by transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nCan the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be determined accurately after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The inability to ascertain the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and its potential influence with the unknown factor \\\\( Q \\\\) makes it impossible to reliably infer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely based on the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), particularly given the complex exponential dependency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z(0) directly influences z(T) through the differential equation P → dz/dt, and the transformation h(z) directly influences z(T)."
