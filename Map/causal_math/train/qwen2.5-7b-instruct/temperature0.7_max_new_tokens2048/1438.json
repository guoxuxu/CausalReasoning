  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and z is a complex-valued function of time t. Investigate the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is another real constant, on the evolution of z.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) scales the initial condition, without knowing whether or not the transformation was applied, it is impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The absence or presence of the transformation fundamentally changes the initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time t is proportional to z itself, scaled by the imaginary unit and omega. The transformation g(z) scales z by e^(kt). Knowing z(T) allows us to trace back to z_0 if g(z) was not applied, given that t = T and z(0) = z_0."
