  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is a matrix applied to a vector field in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex variable and B is another constant matrix, mapping real numbers to complex numbers.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied initially to a certain vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Ax \\\\) without further modification, will the effect at \\\\( z = T \\\\) solely depend on the transformation \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially, the vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is transformed by the complex exponential function, changing its trajectory. Thus, the final state at \\\\( z = T \\\\) depends on both the transformation A and the initial modification by B through the map \\\\( e^{iBz} \\\\), not solely on A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of g(z) influences the initial vector x, which then transforms under A to produce f(x). The effect at z = T depends on both the transformation A and the evolution of g(z) to x."
