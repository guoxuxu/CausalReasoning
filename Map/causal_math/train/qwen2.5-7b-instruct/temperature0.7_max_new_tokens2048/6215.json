  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we examine the flow of an incompressible fluid using the Navier-Stokes equations in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The equations are given by \\\\(\\\\rho (\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla \\\\mathbf{u}) = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\mu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{f}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the fluid density, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of manipulating the viscosity \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) as an external intervention.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) the external force \\\\(\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\) is altered, will the velocity field \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the new force setting and be independent of the previous viscosity and force settings?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the external force at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new dynamic, but the resulting velocity field \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}(T)\\\\) will still depend on the previous states influenced by both the original viscosity setting and the initial external force, besides the fluid's inherent properties and boundary conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
