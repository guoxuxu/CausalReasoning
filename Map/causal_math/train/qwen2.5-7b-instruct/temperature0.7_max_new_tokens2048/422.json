  "Problem": "Given a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( x \\\\) is a spatial variable. The function is initially defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = (K * f)(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f \\\\) is an initial function. We study how the transformation evolves under the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient.\n\nGiven the state of the function \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer the exact form of the kernel function \\\\( K \\\\) used in the initial transformation \\\\( (K * f)(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusion process described by \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) obscures the specific effects of \\\\( K \\\\) because many different kernels could lead to similar diffused states at time \\\\( T \\\\) depending on the properties of \\\\( f \\\\) and the manner of diffusion. Hence, the exact kernel function cannot be uniquely determined from the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) evolves over time t through the PDE ∂_t u = D ∂_{xx} u to become u(x, T). The convolution K * f(x) determines the initial condition u(x, 0), and the diffusion coefficient D influences the spatial second derivative ∂_{xx} u."
