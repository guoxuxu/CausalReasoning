  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are matrices. This system is affected by applying an integration transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int z(t) dt \\\\). We assess how the system behaves with or without this transformation, and how interventions could influence results over time.\n\nGiven only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain which transformations or operations were applied, whether it was \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both, during the system evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which transformations were applied solely from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is impractical without additional data. Since the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\) can create overlapping effects and dependencies among \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( K \\\\), it is challenging to isolate and identify the specific influences of each operation merely based on endpoint observations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map": "Cz + D → z(t); z(t) → z(T); h(z(t)) → z_integrated(t); z(t) → z_integrated(t); z(T) → outcome",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state governed by Cz + D leads to z(t), which evolves over time to become z(T). Applying the integration transform h(z(t)) results in z_integrated(t), and the final state z(T) influences the outcome."
