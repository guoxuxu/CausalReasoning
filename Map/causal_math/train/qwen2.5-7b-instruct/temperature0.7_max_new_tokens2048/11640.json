  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its effect on a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with D being a constant matrix. We investigate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(x) = Mz(t)x \\\\) where M is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can result from various initial conditions and interventions owing to the complex interactions between M, N, and D. Multiple combinations of transformations and initial states could lead to the same outcome, making it impossible to unequivocally deduce the specific interventions or their sequence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
