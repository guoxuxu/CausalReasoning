  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this function, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation, such as a phase shift represented by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) = e^{-i\\\\phi(\\\\omega)} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the function reconstructed from this modified transform depend only on the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and not \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the phase shift function \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) alters the Fourier transform, hence affecting the reconstructed signal. The output will depend on the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the introduced phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\), altering amplitude and/or phase of the components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
