  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the impact of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( L(z) = z + T \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is a real constant, over different scenarios.\n\nIf an intervention is applied through another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i \\theta z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\theta \\\\) is a different constant, after applying \\\\( L \\\\), will the final outcome \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new transformation \\\\( e^{i \\theta (z + T)} \\\\), affecting the final outcome because the combined application of the transformations affects the argument incrementally, depending on both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "L(z) → f(L(z)); g(z) → f(L(z))",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator L to z results in L(z), which is then passed to f; g(z) does not directly influence f(z) but L(z) does."
