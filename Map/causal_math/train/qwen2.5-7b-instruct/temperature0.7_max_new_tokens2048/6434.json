  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant coefficients. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system over time t, where C is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the complex initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing the system's state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some later time T, not knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied originally?",
  "Explanation": "Without clarity on whether transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was employed, and considering its potential impact on the trajectory, you cannot uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The modification introduced by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could mask or alter the initial state sufficiently to prevent a backward calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly causes the state z(T) at time T; x(t) and y(t) directly cause z(t); the constant C directly causes the transformation g(z); however, without knowing if g(z) was applied, inferring z_0 from z(T) alone may be ambiguous."
