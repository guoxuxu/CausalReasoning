  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)](s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) + i\\\\mathcal{L}[v(t)](s) \\\\). We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = az + b \\\\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nCan we uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[az(t) + b](s) \\\\) without knowing the values of a and b?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation parameters a and b are essential for correctly inverting the Laplace Transform back to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without them, the reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the altered transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[az(t) + b](s) \\\\) could correspond to multiple possible functions.",
