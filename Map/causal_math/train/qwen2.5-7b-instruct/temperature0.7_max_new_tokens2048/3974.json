  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(t\\\\) is real time variable. We study the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{is}ds * z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function form at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the presence of the integral transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\), the changes brought about by multiplying the exponential by the integrated function make it impossible to distinctly retrieve the original function unless additional information about the intervention is provided.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
