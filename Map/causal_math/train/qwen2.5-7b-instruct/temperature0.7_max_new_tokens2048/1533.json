  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its influence on a real function defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}F(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex variable. We analyze how transformations and interventions using a separate complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) affect the output of g(x).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex input \\\\( z_0 \\\\) before calculating \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at any point x be the same as it would be under direct application of \\\\( F \\\\) without using \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the input to \\\\( F \\\\) from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\). Given the singularities and specific behavior of \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), the integral computation and hence the resulting function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) will differ unless \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is trivially 1 or -1 (ignoring those, therefore, yields different outcomes).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) → F(z) and then calculating g(x) will yield different results compared to directly applying F(z) → g(x) because h(z) modifies the input z before F(z) acts upon it."
