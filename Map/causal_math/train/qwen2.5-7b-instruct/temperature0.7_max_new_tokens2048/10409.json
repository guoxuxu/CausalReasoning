  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is real and represents time, especially when transformed by another complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0 and evolved under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) under its original dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) to \\\\( (e^{it})^2 = e^{2it} \\\\) at any time t, including at t = 0. Thus, at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\), the transformed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be \\\\( e^{2i\\\\pi} = 1 \\\\), rather than \\\\( e^{i\\\\pi} = -1 \\\\) which you would get without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\). This shows the effect of the transformation alters the endpoint.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Time t directly causes the value of z(t), which then evolves to z(T). Applying f(z) to z(t) results in z^2, but for the comparison, we focus on the direct evolution of z(t) to z(T) over time. At T=π, z(T) under its original dynamics is different from applying f(z) to z(t) at t=0 and then evolving it to T=π."
