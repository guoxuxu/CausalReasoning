  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of functions where the kernel operator K is defined on a function y(x). The relationship between y and its image under K is described through a convolution, i.e., \\\\( K*y = \\\\int h(t) y(x-t) dt \\\\), where h(t) is an impulse response function. We are interested in how the application of Fourier Transform (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) might influence this relationship.\n\nIf a Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) and then \\\\( K*y \\\\) is evaluated, does applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) beforehand change the convolution outcome compared to not applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) first?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of the convolution \\\\( K*y \\\\) is the product of the Fourier Transforms of h(t) and y(x), i.e., \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(K*y) = \\\\mathcal{F}(h) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{F}(y) \\\\). Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) first does not affect the eventual outcome of the convolution because of the convolution theorem in the context of Fourier Transforms.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier Transform to y(x) before convolution with K results in the same outcome as applying the Fourier Transform to the convolution result, due to the convolution theorem which states that the Fourier transform of a convolution is the product of Fourier transforms."
