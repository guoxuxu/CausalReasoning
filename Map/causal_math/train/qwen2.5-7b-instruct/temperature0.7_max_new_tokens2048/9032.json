  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). The impact of a Fourier transform on the wave function is studied to see how it affects the system's evolution.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether a Fourier transform, application of \\\\( W(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of intervention and transformations can lead to the same endpoint due to the linearity and overlapping effects in the Schrödinger equation's solutions. Thus, without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely identify the history and nature of interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential V(x) influences the wave function ψ(x, t), which then evolves to ψ(x, T). A Fourier transform or application of W(x) can also change ψ(x, T). Knowing ψ(x, T) alone does not uniquely determine whether a Fourier transform, application of W(x), or both were applied."
