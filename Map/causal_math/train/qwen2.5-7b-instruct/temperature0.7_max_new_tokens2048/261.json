  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. This setup is used to analyze the interaction between the two exponential terms over time.\n\nDoes the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) strictly depend on the initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) evolving according to their respective exponential transformations without cross-terms influencing one another?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity and independence of the exponential transformations, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) is a linear superposition of \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}y \\\\). There are no cross-terms directly influencing each other due to the structure of the function, indicating a straightforward dependency on \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
