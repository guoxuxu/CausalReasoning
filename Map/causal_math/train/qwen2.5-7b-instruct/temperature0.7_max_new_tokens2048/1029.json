  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) changes the initial condition of the system by adding an exponential term \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), which alters the evolution of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\). This added term evolves and affects the diffusion process distinctively, resulting in a different state at time T.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) directly influences u(x, t) through the diffusion process defined by ∂_t u = D ∂_{xx} u. The constant C influences g(u) which transforms u(x, 0) into u(x, T) independently of the diffusion process. Therefore, applying g(u) before evolving u(x, 0) under the diffusion equation does not yield the same result as directly evolving u(x, 0) under the diffusion equation."
