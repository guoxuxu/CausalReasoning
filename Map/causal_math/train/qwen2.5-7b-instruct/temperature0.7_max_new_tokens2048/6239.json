  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix \\\\omega} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) on the solution.\n\nIf a modification \\\\(M(v) = Av\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the endpoint solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(L\\\\) and not on the initial Fourier transform or the matrix \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(M(v)\\\\) introduces an additional variable that alters how the solution evolves under the operator \\\\(L\\\\). The initial Fourier transform and the matrix \\\\(A\\\\) both influence the resulting endpoint, affecting its behavior in frequency space and complicating the dependency purely on \\\\(L\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "F(u) → u_hat; M(v) → v_hat; L(u) → u_t; F(M(v)) → v_hat_transformed; u_hat → u; v_hat_transformed → u_t_modification",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F to the modified signal M(v) results in a transformed signal v_hat_transformed, which then influences the time derivative u_t_modification of the original signal u through the linear differential operator L. The endpoint solution u_hat at time T depends on L but not directly on the initial Fourier transform F or the matrix A."
