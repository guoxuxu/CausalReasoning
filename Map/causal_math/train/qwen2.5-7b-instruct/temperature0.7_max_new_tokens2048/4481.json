  "Problem": "Assess the effects of a Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant, and its impact on system behavior described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nWill the solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t) \\\\) remain identical if the initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is replaced by its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) \\\\) backtransformed to the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) \\\\) fundamentally alters the characteristics of the original function in the frequency domain. When transformed back, while theoretically an inverse Fourier transform should recover the original function, any practical application or numeric computation might introduce discrepancies, particularly under different system parameters like damping factor b.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(t) directly influences the solution x(t) through the differential equation. The Fourier transform of g(t) results in \\( \\hat{g}(\\omega) \\), which also directly influences x(t) when backtransformed. Therefore, replacing g(t) with \\( \\hat{g}(\\omega) \\) backtransformed to the time domain may change x(t)."
