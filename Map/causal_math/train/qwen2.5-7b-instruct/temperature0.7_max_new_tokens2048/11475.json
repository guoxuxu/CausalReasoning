  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) as a signal through a linear system described by the transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-ix}z(x)dx \\\\). We explore the causal inference ability by analyzing the system's response using advanced calculus and integral transformations.\n\nIf a modulation function \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before it passes through \\\\( T(z) \\\\), will the outcome still exclusively rely on the original function form \\\\( e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the modulation function changes the input to the linear system, thus altering the input that goes into the transform. The outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) now depends on the combined effect of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), resulting in a modified frequency and potentially different transform result.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
