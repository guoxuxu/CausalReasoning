  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the scenario where an integral transform \\\\( K(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(x, s)u(s, t) ds \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) being a kernel function.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) of the system, can we infer the exact initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without knowing whether the integral transform \\\\( K(u) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the information on whether \\\\( K(u) \\\\) was implemented, it is difficult to reverse the effect of the integral transformation and uniquely determine \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\). The transformation could modify the initial condition in a non-invertible way, obscuring the original state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in u over time (u_t) is influenced by the linear differential operator L. Applying the integral transform K to u affects the resulting state of u. Knowing the final state u(x, T) does not necessarily allow inferring the exact initial condition u_0(x) without information about the application of K at t=0."
