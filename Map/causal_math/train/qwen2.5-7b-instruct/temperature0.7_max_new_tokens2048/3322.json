  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), utilized in the context of a linear transformation in the complex plane over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The evolution of a complex function \\( g(z) = az + b \\) follows, where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven the output \\( z(T) \\) from \\( f(z) \\) followed by \\( g(z) \\), can we determine the original number \\( z_0 \\) without knowing \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\( \\omega \\) and hence the exact form of \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\), it's impossible to reverse the rotational transformation accurately. The phase shift introduced by \\( \\omega \\) is essential to trace back correctly to \\( z_0 \\), making it uncertain without that data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z0 evolves through the function f(z) over time T to become z(T), which then undergoes transformation by g(z) to produce z_final."
