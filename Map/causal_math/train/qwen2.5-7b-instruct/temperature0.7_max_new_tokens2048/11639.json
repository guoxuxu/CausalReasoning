  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its effect on a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with D being a constant matrix. We investigate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(x) = Mz(t)x \\\\) where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\cdot z(t) \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor in the system dynamics, leading to an endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) that depends on M and N as well as D. These transformations can affect the trajectory and final state of the system in complex ways due to their non-commutative interactions with the system's dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
