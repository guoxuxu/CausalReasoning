  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential V(x) in one dimension governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) \\\\). We investigate the effect of a linear transformation of the momentum variable \\\\( p \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(p) = ap \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nCan we deduce the original momentum \\\\( p_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(p) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(p) \\\\), which scales the momentum, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the original momentum \\\\( p_0 \\\\), because the observed trajectory could correspond to multiple different initial momenta due to scaling.",
