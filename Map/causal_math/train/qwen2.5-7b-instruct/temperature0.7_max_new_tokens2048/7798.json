  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, resistor, and capacitor arranged in series (RLC circuit). The voltage across the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L, R, C \\\\) are constants and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is the input voltage function. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to the input voltage function.\n\nAfter observing the current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) at any given time t, can we deduce the original form of the input voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) without knowing whether a Laplace Transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the transformation applied to \\\\( V(t) \\\\), there could be multiple potential input functions corresponding to the observed current response due to the properties of the Laplace Transform, which may alter phase and magnitude in various ways.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
