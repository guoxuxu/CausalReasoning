  "Problem": "Consider a function z defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are interested in how the Fourier Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), affects this function.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform at time T which shows multiple peaks, can we decipher exact modifications (like the introduction of \\\\( e^{ivt} \\\\) or any other function) performed at any earlier time \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the presence of additional peaks in the Fourier Transform indicates that interventions occurred, the exact nature and timing of these interventions (like whether it was just a single addition of \\\\( e^{ivt} \\\\) or multiple additive terms at different instances) cannot be unambiguously determined solely from the resultant transform. Multiple configurations can lead to the same frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of multiple peaks in the Fourier Transform at time T indicates modifications, including the possible introduction of e^(ivt) or other functions, that occurred at earlier times like t1."
