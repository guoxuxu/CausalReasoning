  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) with \\( \\lambda > 0 \\), and consider the transformation \\( T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t} \\) applied to \\( u \\).\n\nIf \\( T(u) \\) is applied repeatedly at each interval \\(\\Delta t\\), will \\( u(x, T) \\) directly represent the original dynamics of \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Repeatedly applying \\( T(u) \\) effectively maintains \\( u \\) in a normalized form by continuously nullifying the exponential decay imposed by \\( -\\lambda u \\). This manipulation sustains the function state akin to its initial state, essentially staving off the effects of the governing differential equation, so \\( u(x, T) \\) indeed represents \\( u(x, 0) \\) rather than following the natural decay caused by the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of u at time t influences its rate of change with respect to time (∂u/∂t), which is negative proportional to u itself. Applying T(u) = u * e^(-λt) transforms u over time, and repeatedly applying T(u) at intervals Δt modifies u according to the original dynamics."
