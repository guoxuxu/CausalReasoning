  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(w(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex number. The system is then studied under the transformation, \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t) dt \\\\), an integral transform with parameter \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(w(z)\\\\) is computed for a specific \\\\(z_0\\\\) and then transformed via \\\\(g(w)\\\\) without further changes, will the result of the transformation at \\\\(s = s_0\\\\) be equivalent to applying \\\\(g\\\\) directly to \\\\(z_0\\\\) under the original function definition?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(w)\\\\) involves an integral that takes into account the entire evolution of \\\\(w(z)\\\\) over time influenced by the complex function mapping. The outputs will differ because \\\\(g\\\\) accumulates effects over an infinite duration, which cannot exactly match direct application of \\\\(g\\\\) on the initial condition due to nonlinearities introduced by \\\\(z^2\\\\) in the exponent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
