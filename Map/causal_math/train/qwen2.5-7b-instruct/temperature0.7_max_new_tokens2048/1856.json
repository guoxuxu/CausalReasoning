  "Problem": "Consider the space of complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Suppose we apply an integral transformation represented by \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or any other transformation) were used, solely by analyzing \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of numerous possible transformations that could adjust the dynamics of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) (like varying \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or multiple compounding operations) means the endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) might result from different interventions. The ambiguity in the exponential influence without additional information on the evolution history or the nature of interventions makes accurate backtracking of interventions challenging.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
