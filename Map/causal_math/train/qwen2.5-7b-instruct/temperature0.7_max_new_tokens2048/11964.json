  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a vector space described by a matrix 𝐌. An integral transformation \\\\( T[𝐱](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}𝐌𝐱(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where 𝐱(t) is a vector function affected over time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial state of the vector function \\\\( 𝐱(t) = 𝐱_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) is modified by \\\\( 𝐱_0 \\\\) undergoing the transformation \\\\( 𝐌𝐱_0 \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\) be identical to that of the unmodified initial state?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation of the vector space changes the state dynamics through matrix \\\\( 𝐌 \\\\). Since the transformation modifies the inputs at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), the change in initial conditions results in a different trajectory of \\\\( 𝐱(t) \\\\), and consequently, the integral transform \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\) will also change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform T[𝐱](s) depends on M𝐱_0, which is determined by the initial state 𝐱_0 undergoing the transformation 𝐌. Therefore, if 𝐱_0 is modified by 𝐌, T[𝐱](s) will change."
