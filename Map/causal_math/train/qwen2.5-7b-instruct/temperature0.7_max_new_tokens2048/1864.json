  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator subjected to complex forcing described by the equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency and C is a complex amplitude. We explore the effects of transformation using the Laplace Transform on the solution.\n\nGiven the behavior at a large time t after interventions, can we precisely determine the sequence and nature of the interventions applied to the harmonic oscillator?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of amplitude and timing of interventions (like the changes in amplitudes C and D) can result in a similar end behavior at large t, especially considering the complexity added by factors such as resonance and interference in the system. Thus, it's challenging to ascertain the exact nature and sequence of interventions from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
