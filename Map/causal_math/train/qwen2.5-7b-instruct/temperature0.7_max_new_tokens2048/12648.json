  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), which maps complex function input in the time domain to the frequency domain. An intervention involves altering the system by a complex function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) such that the new system's output is \\\\( Y(s) = X(s) \\\\cdot H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a unit step signal, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the absence of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) be equal to \\\\( X(s) \\\\) without any modification in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) remains identical to the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\), following the property of the identity transformation in the Laplace domain, which leaves \\\\( X(s) \\\\) unaltered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When there is no intervention by h(t), the output Y(s) in the s-domain is directly equal to the Laplace transform of the input x(t), X(s)."
