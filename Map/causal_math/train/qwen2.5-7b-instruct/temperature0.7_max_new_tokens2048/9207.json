  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), with M being a linear operator. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), applied to the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\), transforming it into the s-domain.\n\nIf a new operator \\\\( N \\\\) modifies the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the system state is again transformed, will the final transformed state \\\\( X(s) \\\\) for s > t_1 be dependent only on the original M, and not on the intervention by N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by N alters the dynamics of the system, which in turn modifies the state transformation trajectory. Thus, the final state \\\\( X(s) \\\\) will reflect both the effects of M and the intervening operator N, affecting its representation in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
