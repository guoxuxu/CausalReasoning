  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iωt}\\\\) where \\\\(ω\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a transformation by applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). Further, at a later time, an external operator applies \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nGiven that the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is known, can we pinpoint exactly which transformations (\\\\( f(z), g(z), \\\\) or both) were used, merely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of interventions and natural progressions due to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\). Identifying specific transformations would require more information about the system's evolution, as multiple trajectories can culminate in the same endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
