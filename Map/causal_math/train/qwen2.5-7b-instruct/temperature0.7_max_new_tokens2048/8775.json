  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a particle's position in the complex plane. Assume the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An integral transform \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\) is considered to analyze the system at different instances.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a sudden change is introduced by another integral transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega'(s-t_1)}z(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) is another frequency, will the state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) only depend on the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z)\\\\) starts a new transformation process that superimposes effects governed by \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\), altering the resultant trajectory and the end state at time \\\\(T\\\\), hence depending on both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state at time T depends on z(t) through both f(z) and g(z), but the influence of g(z) is mediated by \\(\\omega'\\) and only affects T after time t1."
