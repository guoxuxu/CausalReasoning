  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(h(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\) in the complex plane and its transformation under the integral \\( I[h] = \\int_{\\gamma} h(z) \\, dz \\) along a contour \\( \\gamma \\). The contour \\( \\gamma \\) is relevant as it defines the effect of \\( h \\) after transformation via path integral.\n\nGiven the integral value \\( I[h] = 2\\pi i \\), can we infer that \\( \\gamma \\) necessarily enclosed the pole at \\( z = 0 \\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\(h(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\) has a simple pole at \\(z = 0\\) with a residue of 1, the integral of \\(h\\) around a contour enclosing this pole results in \\(2\\pi i\\). The specified integral value thus signifies that \\( \\gamma \\) must have enclosed the pole at \\( z = 0 \\).",
