  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) in one dimension, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant representing the diffusion coefficient. We introduce the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior under various scenarios.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the heat equation to \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} + h(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) is a known heat source, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) depend solely on the original heat equation (without \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a heat source \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) significantly alters the solution, and thus the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) will incorporate effects from both the base heat equation and the influence of \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\). This intervention changes the system dynamics, manifesting as additional terms in the Fourier Transform.",
