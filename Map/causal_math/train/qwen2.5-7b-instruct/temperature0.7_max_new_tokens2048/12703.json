  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) known as the Laplace Transform, on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex number.\n\nIf the endpoint result of an intervened Laplace Transform is provided say, \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{(s-A)^2} \\\\), can we determine the exact nature of the intervention (e.g., derivative operation, second transform applied), knowing only the original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit details about the nature of the intervention or additional surrounding context (such as whether a derivative operation or additional transformation was applied), determining the specific intervention from the transform result alone is ambiguous. Various interventions might result in similar or identical transformed expressions, making it challenging to uniquely trace back to the exact intervention used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of f(t) = e^(At) is 1/(s-A), and intervening to get 1/((s-A)^2) suggests a second derivative with respect to 't' was applied to the original function before transformation."
