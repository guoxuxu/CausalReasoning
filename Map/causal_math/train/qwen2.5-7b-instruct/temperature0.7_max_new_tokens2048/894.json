  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t)\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We also introduce a transformation \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) where S is the matrix that diagonalizes D, and K is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) precisely at t = 0 without knowledge if the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, and the exact form of K, the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely reversed from \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The transformation may put the system onto a completely different trajectory, making it non-trivial to extract the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
