  "Problem": "Analyze the outcome of a linear integral transformation \\\\(G(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(t, x) f(t) dt\\\\) on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), where \\\\(K(t, x)\\\\) is a kernel function. We examine the scenarios when the kernel function changes over time, defined as \\\\(K(t, x, s)\\\\) where s represents a parameter influencing the kernel.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) be exactly determined from the resulting \\\\(G(x)\\\\) if both the kernel change \\\\(K(t, x, s) = t^s e^{-t x}\\\\) and another simultaneous intervention modify \\\\(f(t)\\\\) during transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of both a changing kernel and another intervention interacting with \\\\(f(t)\\\\) creates a multifaceted impact on \\\\(G(x)\\\\). These changes contribute to a scenario where the original nature of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved from \\\\(G(x)\\\\) due to the compound effects and potential overlap in transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
