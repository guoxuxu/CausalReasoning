  "Problem": "Consider a functional relationship expressed as a complex integral transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} h(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a known time domain signal and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the impact of a Laplace transform on the signal's properties.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can it be determined whether an operational scaling by \\\\( k \\\\) occurred, strictly from knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying that a scaling operation occurred, and determining the scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\), are not possible simply by observing \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The transformation yields scaled data, but the specific scale factor used cannot be extracted without additional data about initial or comparative conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
