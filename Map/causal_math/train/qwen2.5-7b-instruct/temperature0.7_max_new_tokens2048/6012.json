  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions modified by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) on the boundary \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) to solve for the internal values of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the final solution \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\), can we conclusively determine if either the function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\), \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\), or both were used as interventions on the boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final solution \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\), it is not possible to unambiguously deduce which specific interventions (\\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\), or both) were applied to the boundary. The problem is inherently inverse and ill-posed without additional constraints or data, meaning multiple configurations of \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) could potentially result in the same or similar internal solutions \\\\( z \\\\), especially considering the linearity and symmetry of the Laplace equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
