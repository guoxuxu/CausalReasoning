  "Problem": "Consider a functional relationship expressed as a complex integral transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} h(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a known time domain signal and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the impact of a Laplace transform on the signal's properties.\n\nIf the signal \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is altered to \\\\( h(t) + ke^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants, and no further modification is made, will the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) simply exhibit additive terms corresponding to the modification?",
  "Explanation": "Laplace transformations are linear. Altering the input signal by adding \\\\( ke^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) will manifest in \\\\( H(s) \\\\) as an additive term \\\\( \\\\frac{k}{s-\\\\lambda} \\\\), influencing the output straightforwardly by the linearity of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The signal h(t) directly influences the transformed function H(s). When h(t) is modified to h(t) + ke^(λt), H(s) is directly influenced by this modification, resulting in additive terms corresponding to the change."
