  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) on this function, specifically, the Laplace transform.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i \\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a new constant, and the Laplace transform is then applied, will the transformed function \\\\( T[z'](s) \\\\) only depend on the new frequency \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i \\\\beta t} \\\\) has its own distinct frequency \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), independent of the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Its Laplace transform, \\\\( T[z'](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\beta} \\\\), clearly depends only on \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). The transformed output is thus solely influenced by the intervention's frequency.",
