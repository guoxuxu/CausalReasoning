  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\) with A and B being constant complex matrices. This scenario explores the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) under the linear transformations \\\\( T_x(x, y) = (x+1, y) \\\\) and \\\\( T_y(x, y) = (x, y+1) \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we definitively determine whether transformations \\( T_x \\), \\( T_y \\), or the changed function \\( f' \\) were applied, solely by knowing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) can be influenced by multiple combinations of matrix transformations and translations in x and y. The modifications by \\( e^A \\), \\( e^B \\), \\( e^C \\), and \\( e^D \\) allow for multiple, indistinguishable paths that yield the same result at \\( z(T) \\), making it impossible to determine the exact interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
