  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( v(p) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} u(x) dx \\\\), where p is a complex number. We explore how modifications to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) impact \\\\( v(p) \\\\) through causal inference, particularly examining the effects of differential operators and external interventions.\n\nIs it possible to accurately backtrack the precise sequence and nature of transformations and differential operations applied on \\\\( u(x) \\\\) solely by examining \\\\( v(p) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\\\( v(p) \\\\) under transformations and differential operations generally lacks specific signatures that definitively indicate what transformations or operations were applied. This results from the linear and often commutable properties of integral and differential operators, obscuring the original operations' sequence or nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
