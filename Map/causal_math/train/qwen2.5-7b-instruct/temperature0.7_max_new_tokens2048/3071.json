  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We explore the impact of a boundary condition modification \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\), a given function, and how it affects the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) across the domain.\n\nIf an additional condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y_1) = k(x) \\\\) for some fixed y_1 is introduced as an intervention, will the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) throughout the domain still be predictable solely based on the original boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y_1) = k(x) \\\\) modifies the problem setup and consequently alters the solution throughout the domain. The system now depends on both boundary conditions, not just the initial one at \\\\( y = 0 \\\\).",
