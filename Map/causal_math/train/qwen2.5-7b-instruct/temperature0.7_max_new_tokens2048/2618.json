  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation over complex functions, where the input function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed via a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\), resulting in output \\\\( y(t) = (K * z)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(t-\\\\tau)z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to both the kernel and the input function is considered.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing the Fourier transform was applied to \\\\( K(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the nature of the kernel transformation (Fourier transform in this case) is unknown, the deconvolution problem can be ill-posed, meaning that without knowing the form of \\\\( K(t) \\\\) after transformation, accurately retrieving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
