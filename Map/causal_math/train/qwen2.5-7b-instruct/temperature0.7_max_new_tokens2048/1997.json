  "Problem": "Analyze a hypothetical economic model where output \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) is described by \\\\( Q(t) = Ce^{kt} \\\\), where C is output at t=0, and k is a growth rate constant. The intervention is defined by a policy function \\\\( P(Q) = Qe^{rt} \\\\), with r being a policy-induced growth adjustment factor.\n\nIf the economic model evolves from an initial output \\\\( Q_0 \\\\) without any policy intervention, will the output at time T, denoted as \\\\( Q(T) \\\\), be same as the output evolved with the intervention \\\\( P(Q) \\\\) from a different initial output at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Without the policy intervention, the output grows solely due to the inherent growth rate k. The intervention alters the growth trajectory by modifying the growth rate to include r, changing the output dynamics to depend on both k and r.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Initial output Q(0) exponentially grows over time to become Q(t), and a policy function P(Q) applied to Q(t) results in a modified growth rate for Q(t)."
