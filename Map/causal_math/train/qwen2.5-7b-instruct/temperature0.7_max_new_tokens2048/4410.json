  "Problem": "Examine the effect of performing a Laplace transform on a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). Suppose an inverse Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to yield \\\\( g(t) \\\\). We then analyze whether the transformations preserve certain properties of the original function over time.\n\nGiven only the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing whether any non-linear transformation was applied before taking the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise information about any possible transformations applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform (e.g., non-linear transformations), recovery of the exact form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) may not be accurate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Given only the transformed function F(s), we cannot uniquely determine f(t) without knowing if any non-linear transformation was applied before taking the Laplace transform, as the inverse Laplace transform is unique but the original function might have been altered."
