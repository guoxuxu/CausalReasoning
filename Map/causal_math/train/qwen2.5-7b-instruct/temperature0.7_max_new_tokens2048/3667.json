  "Problem": "We are studying a complex function \\\\( z = f(x+iy) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( f \\\\) is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = z + B \\\\) (with B as a constant complex matrix) affect the output of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + C \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied, will the resulting output of \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the values of \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive transformations \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\) modify the initial and intermediate inputs to the function \\\\( f \\\\). This cascade of transformations means the final state \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) will depend on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\), reflecting the combined effects of the applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
