  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source influences the system described by \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) being added to certain regions at specific times.\n\nBy only observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without any intervention, can we uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The thermal diffusion process described by the heat equation tends to smooth out temperature variations over time, making it inherently lossy in terms of information about specific initial distributions unless very precise data and accurate inversion techniques are available.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An external heat source h(x, t) and the initial temperature distribution u_0 both directly cause the temperature distribution u(x, t) at any given time t. The rate of change of temperature u_t also directly influences the temperature distribution u(x, t)."
