  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), on this system.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if the initial condition was directly evolved in the transformed domain under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{F}(Lu)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) under \\\\(L\\\\) followed by a Fourier transform is equivalent to evolving \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) under the transformed operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(L)\\\\). The commutativity of the Fourier transform with linear differential operators ensures that transforming first and then evolving gives the same result as evolving first and then transforming.",
