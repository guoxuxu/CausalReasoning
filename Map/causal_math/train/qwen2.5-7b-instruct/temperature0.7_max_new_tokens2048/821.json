  "Problem": "Consider a function represented as a complex map \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a constant complex number. This map is used iteratively from an initial point z_0 in the complex plane to study its dynamic evolution.\n\nIf the initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the map is chosen arbitrarily and the map \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied iteratively, will the sequence always converge to a fixed point or limit cycle as t approaches infinity?",
  "Explanation": "The behavior of the sequence generated by the map \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) heavily depends on the choice of c and initial point z_0. For some values of c and initial conditions, the sequence may diverge or remain bounded but not necessarily converge to a fixed point or cycle.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial point z_0 directly influences the sequence generated by iteratively applying the map g(z), which in turn determines whether the sequence converges to a fixed point or limit cycle as t approaches infinity."
