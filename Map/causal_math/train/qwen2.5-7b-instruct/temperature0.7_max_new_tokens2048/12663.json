  "Problem": "Consider a scenario wherein we have a Hilbert space and a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined on this space. The function \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied to any function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) in the space, and then the operator operates on \\\\( h(f(x)) \\\\). Furthermore, we consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and check how applying this transform affects the linear operation.\n\nKnowing the final result after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), then \\\\( L \\\\), can we deduce whether the function was squared before these operations were conducted?",
  "Explanation": "The final state may provide insufficient information to trace back whether the squaring occurred before the Fourier transform and operator application, due to the transformations potentially obscuring or altering the effects uniquely attributable to the squaring operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(x) is transformed by h(x) = x^2 to produce h(f(x)), which is then acted upon by the linear operator L and the Fourier transform F."
