  "Problem": "Contemplate a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves as per the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the scenario under a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant frequency.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( U(z) = z e^{-i\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant frequency) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). These frequency shifts and phase alterations influence continuously throughout the evolution and affect the final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) depends on ω and k, while the transformations T(z) and U(z) introduce temporal shifts but do not alter the fundamental dynamics governed by ω and k. Therefore, z(T) for T > t_1 depends only on ω and k, irrespective of θ or β."
