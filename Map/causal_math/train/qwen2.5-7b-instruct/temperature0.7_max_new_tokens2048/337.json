  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = \\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2}\\\\), where c is the wave speed. Let the transformation \\\\(f(u) = u \\\\cdot e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) be applied, where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is applied at t=0 to an initial dispersion-free wave function \\\\(u_0\\\\), and allowed to evolve according to the wave equation without further intervention, will the wave form at t=T be identical to that if \\\\(u_0\\\\) was merely propagated to t=T under the standard wave equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(u) = u \\\\cdot e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) modifies the amplitude of the wave function over time, causing the wave form at any later time t=T to differ from the propagation under the standard wave equation without the transformation. This results from the exponential growth or decay imposed by \\\\(e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(u) → u; u_0 → u; t=0 → f(u); T → u; c → u; λ → u",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(u) applied at t=0 changes the initial wave u_0 over time, while the standard wave propagation with wave speed c maintains the form of u from t=0 to t=T. The effect of f(u) with constant λ modifies the wave differently than simple propagation, so the wave form at t=T will generally not be identical."
