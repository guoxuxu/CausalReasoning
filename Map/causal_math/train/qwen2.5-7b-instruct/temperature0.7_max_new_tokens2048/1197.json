  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{−λt}(x + iy) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( λ \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed under the application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and time evolution t.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 forming \\\\( L(z_0) \\\\), then allowed to evolve under the given complex function without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly at t = T to the untransformed \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( L(z_0) \\\\) introduces a modification in the trajectory from the very beginning, due to constant b in L. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will involve both the effect of the intrinsic decay factor \\\\( e^{−λT} \\\\) and the initial boost from \\\\( L \\\\), differing fundamentally from directly applying \\\\( L \\\\) at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
