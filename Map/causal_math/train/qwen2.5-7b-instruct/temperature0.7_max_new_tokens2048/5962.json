  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform analysis on an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\\\omega^2V = 0\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is the voltage across a component, and \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants related to damping and angular frequency. Analyzing the response of the system under different initial voltages is of interest, comparing it to transformed conditions using \\\\(f(V) = V + e^{\\\\alpha t}V\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the voltage \\\\(V(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine definitively the original voltage function \\\\(V_0(t)\\\\) at any time t, considering that \\\\(f(V)\\\\) might have been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of exponential modification in \\\\(f(V)\\\\) could significantly alter the trajectory of the voltage, causing differences that are dependent on the value of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\). Since exponential growth or decay can profoundly affect outcomes in dynamic systems, without knowing if or how \\\\(f(V)\\\\) was applied, deducing \\\\(V_0(t)\\\\) purely from \\\\(V(T)\\\\) becomes complicated and generally indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "V → V(T); f → f(V); T → V(T); α → f(V); ζ → dV/dt; ω → d^2V/dt^2; V(0) → V(t); V'(0) → V(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial voltage V(0) and its derivative V'(0) directly influence the voltage V(t) at any time t. The application of f(V) with constant α modifies the voltage V over time, leading to V(T) at time T. Damping factor ζ and angular frequency ω determine the behavior of the differential equation governing V(t)."
