  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature inside a chamber, denoted as T(t), evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T_a - T)\\\\), with T_a being the ambient temperature and k a positive constant. An intervention is introduced by adjusting T_a through a function \\\\( f(t) = T_a + \\\\Delta T_a \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), modifying the ambient temperature periodically.\n\nIf the chamber's temperature evolution starts from an initial condition T(0) without any subsequent modification to the ambient temperature T_a, will the temperature T(t) at any time t > 0 be solely dependent on the initial ambient temperature T_a0?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, the evolution of T(t) follows the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T_a0 - T)\\\\). This makes T(t) explicitly dependent only on the initial T_a0 and the initial condition T(0), following the natural exponential decay or increase towards T_a0.",
