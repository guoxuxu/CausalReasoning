  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( L\\{y(t)\\} = Y(s) \\), where \\( y(t) \\) is a function in the time domain and \\( Y(s) \\) is its corresponding representation in the complex frequency domain. Assume an initial condition \\( y(0) = y_0 \\) and study the effects of an impulse response \\( h(t) \\) applied to this system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( H(s) \\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\( Y(s)H(s) \\), can the original \\( Y(s) \\) be uniquely determined without knowing the specific form of \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\( H(s) \\), the transformation \\( Y(s)H(s) \\) cannot be uniquely inverted to \\( Y(s) \\). Various forms of \\( H(s) \\) could lead to the same product, indicating that multiple potential original functions \\( Y(s) \\) could exist.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
