  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time Markov chain with state space \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\) governed by the transition rate matrix \\\\(Q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -\\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\). We are investigating the effect of modifying transition rates with a scalar function \\\\(f(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf a second scaling function \\\\(g(t) = e^{\\\\beta t}\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the transition rates further, will the state probabilities at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), be determined entirely by the original matrix \\\\(Q\\\\) regardless of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention by \\\\(g(t)\\\\) complicates the dynamic by further adjusting the transition rates, making the final probabilities at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) dependent not only on \\\\(Q\\\\) but also on the values of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\). These factors influence the rate at which transitions occur, thus affecting the entire evolution of the state probabilities.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
