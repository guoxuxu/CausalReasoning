  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The system undergoes an operation defined by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}e^{Mt}Ux \\\\), where U is a constant, invertible matrix, and t is the time variable.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could modify the initial conditions in such a way that knowing just \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is insufficient to uniquely retrace to \\\\( x_0 \\\\), particularly if U is not a scalar multiplication of the identity matrix, leading to non-trivial changes in the state vector's orientation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
