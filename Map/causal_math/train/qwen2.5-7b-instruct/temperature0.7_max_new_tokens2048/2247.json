  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\) acting on a complex function \\( x(t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We examine the consequences of applying an Integral transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an additional unitary transformation \\( u(t) = e^{-i\\eta t}x(t) \\) (where \\( \\eta \\) is a new constant frequency) is applied as an intervention, will the transformed output \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) for t > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the original transformation \\( z(t) \\) irrespective of \\( u(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( u(t) \\) alters the state again, adding another frequency component \\( -i\\eta \\). Even if \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) was established prior to \\( t_1 \\), the subsequent state will reflect the compounding effect of the two transformations, affecting the output in a manner dependent on both \\( \\eta \\) and \\( \\omega \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformed output L{z(t)} for t > t1 depends on z(t) and is not directly influenced by the intervention u(t) due to the properties of the Laplace transform."
