  "Problem": "Consider a system involving variables \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(z\\\\) with the relationship governed by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The impact of altering variable \\\\(x\\\\) through a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nGiven the observed outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely if either \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both were applied only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linear and potentially overlapping effects of the exponential operations from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely specify which transformations were applied simply by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Different combinations of B and C may yield the same final integral result under certain conditions, causing ambiguity in determining the exact sequence or type of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
