  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We analyze how transformations by the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, affect the solution over time.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z_0(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed solution at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) modifies the function by integrating it with a damping exponential factor, thereby altering the state dynamics from the very beginning. This change affects how the function evolves according to the differential equation, leading to a different state at any future time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) under the differential equation dz/dt = iωz determines its form. Applying the integral operator L{z} with parameter s transforms z(t) into z_transformed(t). If z0(t) = e^(iωt) evolves under the differential equation from t=0 to t=T, it may differ from the transformation of z0(t) at t=0 by L{z} evolving to t=T without further intervention."
