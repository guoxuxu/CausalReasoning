  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions related to the real and imaginary parts of a complex function subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) obtained at s = a, can we infer with certainty whether the initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) were doubled if we do not know the applied transformation?",
  "Explanation": "If the specifics of the transformation (like scaling of initial conditions or the nature of any other modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)) are unknown, multiple modifications could result in the same transformed output, making exact inference about the initial conditions impossible.",
