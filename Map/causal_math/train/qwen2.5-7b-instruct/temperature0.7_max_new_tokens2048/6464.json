  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of the integral transformation \\\\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\\\) on the function \\\\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform output \\\\\\( G(p) \\\\\\), can we uniquely identify whether an intervention \\\\\\( U[g(t)] \\\\\\) or just the initial transformation \\\\\\( T[f(t)] \\\\\\) occurred, knowing \\\\\\( p, s, \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of multiple constants and the overlapping effects due to the linearity and similarities in the operation of Laplace transforms for exponential and sinusoidal functions means that \\\\\\( G(p) \\\\\\) cannot precisely indicate whether it was influenced solely by \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) or followed by \\\\\\( U \\\\\\). The results from \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( U \\\\\\) could potentially produce similar forms, making it challenging to discern the specific transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) is transformed by T into G(p), and the intervention U applied to g(t) is also transformed by T into G(p). Knowing p, s, and ω allows us to determine G(p) from f(t) but does not uniquely identify whether the transformation came from f(t) or U[g(t)]."
