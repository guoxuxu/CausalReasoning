  "Problem": "Consider a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( F(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is an initial function. This scenario examines the effects of various manipulations on the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) in terms of how it impacts \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we exactly trace back from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to know both the original function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( k(s) \\\\) applied at \\\\( t_0 \\\\), solely based on the output at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that different combinations of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and \\\\( k(s) \\\\) can potentially yield the same resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it would not be feasible to uniquely determine both the original and the modified functions from the resultant transformation alone without further distinguishing data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function g(s) directly influences z(t) through the integral transformation. An intervention k(s) at time t_0 affects g(s), which in turn influences z(t)."
