  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation defined by the operator \\\\( L(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final observation \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be determined exactly which transformations, \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both were applied, by knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Similar end states \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from different combinations or sequences of transformations due to the non-commutative nature of the exponential operators. The complexity of the interactions between Q, R, and P does not allow for backtracking of the exact path or interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
