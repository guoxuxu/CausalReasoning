  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the changes in the output when a transformation defined by \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) and then allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the new function \\( y(t) = g(z(t)) \\) have integral properties that reflect the initial functional form \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) at every \\( t \\) except t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\( g(z(t)) \\) directly accumulates the values of \\( z(t) \\), and while \\( y(t) \\) will change over time due to the accumulation, it retains a dependency on the original function \\( z(t) \\). Hence, \\( y(t) \\) directly reflects its derivative as \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), except at \\( t = 0 \\) where it is zero.",
