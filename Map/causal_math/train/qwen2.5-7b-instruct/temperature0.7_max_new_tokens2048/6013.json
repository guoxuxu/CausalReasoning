  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) is applied to transform a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) via the integral \\( G(a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{az} g(z) \\, dz \\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number, and the transformation explores how changes in \\\\( a \\\\) affect the outcome of the integral transformation.\n\nIf the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is altered to \\\\( a' \\\\) without any intervention on \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the resulting transformed function \\\\( G(a') \\\\) at some later observation point \\\\( a' \\\\) be the same as the unaltered transformation at \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( a' \\\\) changes the nature of the exponential function in the integral, leading to a potentially different outcome in the transformed function \\\\( G(a') \\\\). The sensitivity of the integral to the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) ensures that the resulting transformation will not remain the same unless \\\\( a = a' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
