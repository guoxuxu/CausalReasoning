  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf a frequency shift operation \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(t) \\\\cdot e^{i \\\\delta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is a constant, is applied before taking the Fourier transform, will the result \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) be affected?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of frequency shifting \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) results in a new signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\cdot e^{i \\\\delta t} = e^{i (\\\\omega + \\\\delta) t} \\\\). The Fourier transform will now peak at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\), thus shifting the position of the delta function in the frequency domain, indicating a direct effect of the intervention on the transform result.",
