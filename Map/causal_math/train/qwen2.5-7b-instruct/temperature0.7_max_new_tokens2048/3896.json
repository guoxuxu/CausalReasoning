  "Problem": "Consider a complex analytic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impacts of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Me^{Qt}z \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nConsidering the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify which transformations (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the system's evolution, solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) and their associated matrices \\\\( M, Q, N, \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the possible non-commuting nature of these matrices with each other and with \\\\( P \\\\). Thus, identifying the exact interventions based solely on the endpoint is infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to t (dz/dt) is determined by P. The transformation T(z) leads to z(T), influenced by both M and Q. Therefore, knowing z(T) alone does not precisely identify whether T(z), U(z), or both were applied, as it depends on the specific values of M and Q."
