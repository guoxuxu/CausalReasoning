  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the observation of the system state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) can we determine precisely whether an initial Fourier transform followed by an inverse transform at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) was applied, solely based on the information of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) may result from various manipulative pathways, including different timings and types of transformations. Unless additional information about the operations during [0, T] is known, notably the nature of operator \\\\( L \\\\) on transformed states, it's impossible to accurately deduce the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0 directly influences the system state u(T). Applying the Fourier transform F to u_0 results in F(u_0), which also directly influences u(T). Additionally, applying the inverse Fourier transform F^(-1) to u(T) at time t_1 results in u(t_1)."
