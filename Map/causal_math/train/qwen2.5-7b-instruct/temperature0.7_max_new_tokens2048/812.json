  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear PDE \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the influence of applying the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), on the function u(t).\n\nKnowing only the Laplace transformed function \\\\(F(s, T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely the differential operators (like L or M) used up to that point?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed function, \\\\(F(s, T)\\\\), is typically unable to provide explicit information about the interim evolutionary processes or specific characteristics of the differential operators, unless additional contextual or system-specific information is known. The transformations could feasibly align in many ways, leading to the same final transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace transform F(s, T) of u(t) at time T allows us to infer the effect of the differential operator L on u(t), since L directly influences the time derivative of u(t)."
