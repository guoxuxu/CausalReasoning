  "Problem": "Analyze the causal impact on a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), governed by a set of coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du\\\\), where A, B, C, D are matrices and u is a control function. We explore the system's behavior as influenced by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original differential equations and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or the form of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity and modification, causing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to also depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) along with the interaction effects between the transformation and the original system matrices (A, B, C, D). \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega t} \\\\) effectively counters or alters the initial transformation, impacting the resulting trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A control function u directly influences x(t) and y(t); the transformation f(z) modifies z(t); the subsequent transformation g(z) also modifies z(t), but the endpoint z(T) for T > t1 depends on the original differential equations and not on ω or the form of interventions."
