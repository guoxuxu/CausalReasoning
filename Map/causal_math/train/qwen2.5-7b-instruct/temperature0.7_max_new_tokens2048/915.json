  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the effect of performing a Fourier transform on \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) denotes the Fourier transform and k represents the transformed spatial variable.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the differential operator L to a new operator M at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and we apply the Fourier transform to this scenario, will the final state \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) \\\\) at any \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the Fourier transformed M, not on the original L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the dynamics of the system post \\\\( t_1 \\\\), making the final state \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) \\\\) dependent on both the Fourier transforms of L and M. The behavior before and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) ties the transformed states to both operators' characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
