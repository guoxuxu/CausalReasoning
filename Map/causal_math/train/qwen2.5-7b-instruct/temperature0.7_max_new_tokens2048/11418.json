  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nLooking at the Fourier transform of \\\\( p_{new}(x) \\\\), can you unequivocally determine the original function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) in the Gaussian kernel?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) is crucial because it determines how much each frequency component is dampened. Without this, it is impossible to accurately invert the frequency alterations caused by the convolution with the Gaussian kernel.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Convolution with a Gaussian kernel G(x; σ) changes the original function p(x) to p_new(x). The Fourier transform of the Gaussian kernel affects the Fourier transform of the new function. The standard deviation σ influences the Fourier transform of the Gaussian kernel."
