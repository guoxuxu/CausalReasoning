  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex variable. We explore the effect of modifying the system using a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming the original to \\\\( y'(t) = (y * h)(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( Y''(s) \\\\) at the end, can we identify uniquely which transformations (\\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both) were applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "The product form of \\\\( Y''(s) = Y(s)H(s)G(s) \\\\) doesn't allow us to distinguish between the effects of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) purely based on the final transform, due to the non-identifiability of the contributing factors from the product alone.",
