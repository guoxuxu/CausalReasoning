  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system using the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the position and \\\\( t \\\\) is the time. The function evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. An initial wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) undergoes the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) = \\\\int K(x, s) \\\\psi_0(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new kernel \\\\( L(x, s) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention modifying the wave function, will the state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the parameters of the Schrödinger equation and not on the properties of \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) or \\\\( L(x, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new kernel \\\\( L(x, s) \\\\) additionally alters the wave function, making the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) dependent not only on the original Schrödinger dynamics but also significantly on the effects of both \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) and \\\\( L(x, s) \\\\). These transformations affect how the wave function evolves over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial wave function ψ(x, 0) determined by K(x, s) influences ψ(x, t) which then evolves under the Schrödinger equation to determine ψ(x, T). Introducing L(x, s) at t_1 affects ψ(x, t_1) but its impact on ψ(x, T) depends on the Schrödinger equation's dynamics."
