  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t that satisfy a coupled differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. We investigate how the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), impacts causal inference.\n\nIf the initial condition of the system is changed from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(0) \\\\), will the transformed system \\\\( Z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if originally evolved from \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the initial condition from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(0) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), leading to a different \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since the Fourier transform is linear but sensitive to input, \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) will capture these differences, especially given the dependency on A, B, C, and D.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) influences the evolution of z(t), which in turn determines the Fourier transform Z(ω). Similarly, the initial condition z'(0) influences the evolution of z'(t), determining Z'(ω). Therefore, changing z(0) to z'(0) will result in different Z'(ω) compared to Z(ω)."
