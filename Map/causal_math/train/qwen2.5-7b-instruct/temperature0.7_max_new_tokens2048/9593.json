  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-dependent signal in the complex plane where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This scenario analyzes the impact of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), applied to this function and its influence over frequency domain representation.\n\nDoes applying the Fourier Transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention change its frequency domain representation to only have a component at the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\). This transformation precisely captures the frequency content at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) with no alteration to other frequencies, thus having a component solely at \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
