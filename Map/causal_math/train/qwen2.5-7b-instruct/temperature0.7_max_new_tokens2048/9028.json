  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We evaluate the function under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(u) du \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( g(h(z)) \\\\), is it possible to precisely trace back to the original z or distinguish between transformations like \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\), just using the output?",
  "Explanation": "Distinguishing between transformations based solely on \\\\( g(h(z)) \\\\) is not feasible, as both \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( z^3 \\\\) or other polynomial transformations may lead to similar integral results. Multiple transformations can lead to the same resulting function value due to the nature of complex function integrals over variable and complex paths.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) determines g(z) through integration, and h(z) transforms z before evaluating g(h(z)), making it difficult to trace back to the original z or distinguish between different h(z) transformations like z^2 or z^3 based solely on g(h(z)) output."
