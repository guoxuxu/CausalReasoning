  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by an integral transformation using Laplace Transform with \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} y(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We focus on the consequences of modifying this system through a convolution with the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and the corresponding transformation in the Laplace domain is \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformed state \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we determine the specific convolution functions used (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both), just by examining \\\\( Y(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain may be achieved through different combinations and sequences of convolutions, considering the overlapping impacts of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\). Thus, it's not feasible to uniquely determine the interventions from the final result alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform Y(s) of y(t) is influenced by the convolution with h(t), which transforms to H(s) in the Laplace domain. Therefore, knowing Y(s) allows us to infer the presence of h(t) but not necessarily g(t) if it was also convolved."
