  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, defined as \\\\( Lf = \\\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\\\. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is used to analyze the system.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) = f(x) + h(x) \\\\) at some point after \\\\( L \\\\) is applied and before Fourier transforming, does the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) still merely reflect the operations of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the function to which \\\\( L \\\\) is applied, and thus the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) reflects both the effect of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and on \\\\( h(x) \\\\). The transformation and the addition of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) will both be evident in the Fourier space.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear operator L to f(x) results in hat{f}(k) through its Fourier transform. Introducing h(x) to form g(x) = f(x) + h(x) changes g(x) which then transforms to hat{g}(k), incorporating the effect of h(x) alongside L's operation."
