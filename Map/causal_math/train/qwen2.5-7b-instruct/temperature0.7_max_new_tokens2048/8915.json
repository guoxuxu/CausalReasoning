  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit where the voltage across the capacitor is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{R}I(t)\\\\), with R being the resistance, C the capacitance, and I(t) a time-varying input current. We analyze the behavior of this system under the function \\\\( g(V) = V + e^{At}\\\\), where A is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( h(V) = V - e^{Bt} \\\\) (where B is another constant) is applied, will the voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the initial differential equation and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds a new dynamic, and the final voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) depends on the specifics of the initial conditions modified by \\\\( g(V) \\\\) and the subsequent alteration by \\\\( h(V) \\\\). Both A and B contribute to shaping the trajectory of the voltage across the capacitor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "I(t) → V; V → dV/dt; V(t1) → V(T); h(V) → V(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input current I(t) directly influences the voltage V, which in turn affects the rate of change of voltage dV/dt. The voltage V at time t1 influences its value at time T. The interventions h(V) and the constants A, B do not directly affect the dependency of V(T) on the initial conditions and the differential equation."
