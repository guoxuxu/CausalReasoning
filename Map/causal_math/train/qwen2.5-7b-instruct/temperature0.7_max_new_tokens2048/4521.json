  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the function u, and then evolving it under a transformed operator \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform changes the domain from time-space to frequency-space, in which the evolution of the system under the operator L is fundamentally altered. The transformed system evolves under \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\), requiring inverse transformation to recover u, and potentially leading to a different u(T) than an untransformed evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F(u_0) results in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}\\\\), which evolves over time under the operator L to produce u(t). Directly evolving u_0 under L also produces u(t). Therefore, without further intervention, u(t) at time T after applying the Fourier transform and evolving under L will be the same as directly evolving u_0 under L to time T."
