  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nGiven the population distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we exactly determine the initial distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether any transformation like Fourier was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of an intervention such as a Fourier transform at any point, the potential modification to the population distribution introduces uncertainties, making it impossible to infer the exact initial condition directly from the later state using the PDE alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The population density at a later time u(x, t) is influenced by the initial population density u(x, 0) and the diffusion coefficient D. Applying a Fourier transform F(u) to the population distribution at a specific moment can alter u(x, t), but knowing u(x, t) alone does not allow us to exactly determine u(x, 0) without additional information."
