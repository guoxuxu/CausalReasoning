  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position components in a temporal dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with A and B being complex numbers.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without any knowledge of B?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing B, the back-calculation of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is ambiguous because B could have various values affecting the trajectory significantly. The differential equation includes B, making it essential for precisely retracing the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
