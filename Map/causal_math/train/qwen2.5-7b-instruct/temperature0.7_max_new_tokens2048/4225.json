  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformation affect the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T?",
  "Explanation": "The differential equation continues to govern the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) independently of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), which only impacts how the historical values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T are integrated and weighted. The transformation doesn't modify the ongoing evolution according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\).",
