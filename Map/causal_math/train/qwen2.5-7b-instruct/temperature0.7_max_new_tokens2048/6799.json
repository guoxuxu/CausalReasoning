  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebraic scenario where a random initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and then evolves under a linear transformation governed by matrix \\\\( L \\\\), leading to \\\\( z_t = L^t M z_0 \\\\) over discrete time steps \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_k \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( N \\\\) (another matrix) intervenes, and then evolution continues with \\\\( L \\\\), will the system at time \\\\( T \\\\) (> \\\\( t_k \\\\)) show dependency only on matrices \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix \\\\( N \\\\) adds further complexity, but the ultimate state at any time \\\\( T \\\\) still depends on the initial transformation by \\\\( M \\\\). Since the process starts with \\\\( M z_0 \\\\), both \\\\( M \\\\) and the intervening matrix \\\\( N \\\\) will influence the final state when evolved by matrix \\\\( L \\\\). The total effect is a compound one involving all matrices \\\\( M \\\"), \\\\( N \\\"), and \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector z_0 is transformed by matrix M to produce z_{t_k}. Then, from time t_k onwards, matrix N influences z_t along with matrix L. Thus, for times T > t_k, the state z_T depends on both matrices L and N, but not on M."
