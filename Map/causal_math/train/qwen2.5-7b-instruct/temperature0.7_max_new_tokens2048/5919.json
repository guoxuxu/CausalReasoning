  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system where the input-output relationship is governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\), with \\( x(t) \\) representing the system state at time \\( t \\) and \\( A \\) a complex constant matrix. We analyze the effect of transforming the system state via a function \\( g(x) = D x \\), where \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nIf during the system's evolution, an intervention using a function \\( h(x) = Sx \\) (where \\( S \\) is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\), will the output \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) be independent of the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( h(x) = Sx \\) introduces a new factor which along with \\( D \\) and \\( A \\), determines the system's subsequent state. Since \\( e^{tA} \\), \\( D \\), and \\( S \\) might not commute, their combined and sequential effects influence the final condition \\( z(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The system state x(t) directly influences the output z(t) through the transformation e^(tA)x(t). Applying the intervention h(x) = Sx at time t_1 changes the state x(t) for t >= t_1, which in turn affects z(T) for T > t_1. The matrices A and D do not directly influence z(T) after the intervention h(x) is applied."
