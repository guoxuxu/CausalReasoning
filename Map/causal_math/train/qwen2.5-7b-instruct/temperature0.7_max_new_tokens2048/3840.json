  "Problem": "Evaluate the real part of the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a, b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(t\\\\) is the time variable. We explore an integral transformation by applying Laplace transform on this complex function.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform result after a phase shift, can the original function be exactly recovered including the value of the phase shift?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift introduces an ambiguity, as the same modified Laplace transform result could possibly be produced by different combinations of phase shifts and alterations in the original function’s parameters. Thus, without additional information, exact recovery including the phase shift value is not achievable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "time t directly influences the complex function z(t); the constants a and b directly influence z(t); z(t) is transformed into its modified Laplace transform; the modified Laplace transform is related to the phase shift; the modified Laplace transform can potentially be used to recover the original function along with the phase shift"
