  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit with resistors, capacitors, and inductors described by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, I is the current, and V(t) is the input voltage at time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a frequency filter is added as an intervention affecting the circuit's inductance and capacitance, will the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial conditions and not on the characteristics of the filter?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the frequency filter changes the circuit's dynamics by altering L and C, which affects how the circuit responds to the input voltage. The final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) depends not only on the initial conditions but also significantly on these circuit properties introduced by the filter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The inductance (L) and capacitance (C) directly cause the final current (I(T)) for T > t_1. The input voltage (V(t)) and time (t) also causally influence the current (I(t)). At time t_1, the frequency filter changes the inductance (L) and capacitance (C)."
