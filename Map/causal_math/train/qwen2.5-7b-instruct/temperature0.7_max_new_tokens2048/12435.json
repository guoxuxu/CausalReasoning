  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear operator transformation on a Fourier series representation of a function. Let \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} a_n e^{inx} \\\\), and the transformation is defined by \\\\( T(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\), where \\\\( b_n \\\\) are coefficients modifying the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\).\n\nGiven the final observed function at time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( T' \\\\), or both), only by knowing the modified Fourier coefficients?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier coefficients represent a product of the initial coefficients and all transformation coefficients applied (\\\\( b_n \\\\) and \\\\( c_n \\\\)). Without explicit knowledge of these transformations and their sequences, multiple combinations of \\\\( b_n \\\\) and \\\\( c_n \\\\) could yield the same final coefficients, making it impossible to precisely identify the transformations used solely from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T directly causes changes in the coefficients b_n, which in turn are derived from the original coefficients a_n of the function g(x). The transformed function T(g(x)) results in modified coefficients b_n."
