  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation considered is applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the Fourier transform, it's challenging to uniquely determine the initial condition since the transformation could have significantly altered the base state of the temperature distribution.",
