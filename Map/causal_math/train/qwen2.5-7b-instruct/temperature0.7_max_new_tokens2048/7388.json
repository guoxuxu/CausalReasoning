  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), applied to this function over variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform outcome after an unknown intervention on \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we determine exactly what the intervention was (the value of \\\\( \\delta \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform may not uniquely link back to the specific intervention unless additional information about the timing and nature of the change in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is known. Similar transforms might result from different interventions, leading to ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
