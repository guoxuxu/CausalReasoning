  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time following the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. Further, investigate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) at any given time t, where N is another complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we recover the exact initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise information on whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, and given that the change introduced by \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) can significantly vary dependent on N with regards to M, it's generally impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just based on the state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) is influenced by the value of z at time t (z(t)), which is determined by the differential equation with matrix M; applying the transformation h(z) with matrix N changes z(t); the initial value z_0 directly influences z(t)"
