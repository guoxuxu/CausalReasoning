  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Let's define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, solely depend on the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and ignore the effects of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another phase shift modification through \\\\( g(z) \\\\) means that the output state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by both transformations, where the phases (\\\\( \\\\omega, \\\\theta \\\\)) play roles in modifying both amplitude and rotation of the complex function from its initial state. Hence, T's final state cannot ignore the impact of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
