  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze whether certain transformations can infer causal relationships or predict the system's behavior accurately.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) and knowing the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we uniquely determine the phase shifts \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) that were applied at t = 0 and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) respectively?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed result \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) could correspond to different combinations of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the function and the complex interaction between multiple phase shifts. Multiple scenarios may yield the same observation at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
