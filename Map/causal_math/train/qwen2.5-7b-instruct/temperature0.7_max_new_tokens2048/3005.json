  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing physical quantities in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied to analyze the system's behavior.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to the system's initial output \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then the system evolves according to its LTI dynamics without further intervention, will the output at time \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be influenced by the initial function application of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) at the initial stage modifies the initial conditions of the system, hence impacting the entire evolution path due to the convolution nature of the integral transform. As the LTI system's behavior is affected by initial conditions, the initial application of \\\\( T \\\\) influences the output at any later time, including at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
