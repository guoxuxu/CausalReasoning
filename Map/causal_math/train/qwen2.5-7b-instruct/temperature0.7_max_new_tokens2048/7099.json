  "Problem": "Analyze the implications of applying a Fourier transform to a signal and then filtering with a kernel represented by H(s), an analytic function in the complex frequency domain, on the properties of the signal.\n\nIf a signal is first Fourier transformed, then a time-varying filter H(t, s) (where H is now a function of both time and frequency) is applied, and the signal is inverse transformed back to the time domain, will this process not vary the original signal's time-domain characteristics?",
  "Explanation": "The use of a time-varying filter H(t, s) adds additional complexity, causing variations in the signal's frequency domain that depend dynamically on time. This transformation inevitably modifies the signal's time-domain characteristics, including potential changes in local time behaviors such as transient responses and steady-state amplitude.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transform to a signal converts it to the frequency domain, where it is filtered by a time-varying function H(t, s), then inverse-transformed back to the time domain, resulting in modified signal properties."
