  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and x(t) is a function in time. This model explores the transformation of x(t) into z(x) over a period T, focusing on its impact in a linear system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Bx \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention changes x(t) at a specific time to \\\\( x'(t) = Mx(t) \\\\) where M is another constant matrix, will the resulting \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at T be independent of the matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies x(t) to \\\\( x'(t) = Mx(t) \\\\), impacting how x(t) is integrated into \\\\( z(x) \\\\). Since M alters x(t) throughout the remaining time until T, the resulting \\\\( z(x) \\\\) will depend on M due to how the modified function interacts with \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) in the integral. Thus, the effect of M is carried through to \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
