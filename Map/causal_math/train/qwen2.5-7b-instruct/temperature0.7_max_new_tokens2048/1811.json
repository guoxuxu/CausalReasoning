  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) defined on a contour in the complex plane. The contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) is analyzed over a closed path C. Let \\\\( a \\\\) be a complex constant.\n\nIf during the integration process, a linear transformation \\\\( z = Bw \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex matrix) is applied to the contour C, will the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) depend exclusively on the original function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) without influence from \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation alters the contour of integration. The Exponential function's behavior under the change of variable affects the integral due to contour deformation and additional complex interaction introduced by B, affecting how the integral is evaluated over C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
