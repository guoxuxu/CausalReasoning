  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant vector in complex space. This function is used to transform an initial vector in a complex vector space. We investigate the influence of applying an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) at a time t, where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) operates on a vector \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0 and progresses naturally under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) without further modifications, will the vector at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x \\\\) had just evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, since the transformation \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) is applied from the beginning and continuously influences the vector \\\\( x \\\\) in a predefined manner, the state at any time t = T will simply be a result of this uninterrupted transformation, resulting in \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}x \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the transformation z(t) = e^(iAt)x from t=0 to t=T transforms the vector x into a new state. Applying an additional transformation g(z) = e^(Dt)z at any time t does not change the final state of the vector at t=T if no other modifications occur between the two transformations. Thus, the vector's state at t=T after the combined transformations is equivalent to its state if it only evolved under z(t) = e^(iAt)x from t=0 to t=T."
