  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. The solution at any time can be transformed using a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we reconstruct the exact initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing if the Fourier transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation is invertible, and its application is independent of the linear time evolution due to operator \\\\(L\\\\). So, regardless of when the Fourier transformation was applied, one can accurately reconstruct \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transformation of the state at time t (F(u) → hat{u}(k)) allows us to transform the state to its frequency domain representation. The evolution of the state in time (u_t → Lu) is governed by the differential operator L. Knowing the Fourier transformed state at time T (hat{u}(T)) does not directly allow us to reconstruct the exact initial state u_0 without additional information about the system's dynamics and the specific form of the operator L."
