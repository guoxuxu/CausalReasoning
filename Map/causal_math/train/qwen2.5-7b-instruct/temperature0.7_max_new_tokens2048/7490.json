  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a diagonalizable matrix. We introduce an operator transformation \\\\( F(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is another matrix, and analyze its effect on the system over a period of time t.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( F(x) \\\\), it is ambiguous whether the observed state comes from \\\\( e^{Mt}x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{Mt}(Ax_0) \\\\). The operator \\\\( A \\\\) could alter the state in a way that is non-reversible just by observing the outcome unless specific properties of A are known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
