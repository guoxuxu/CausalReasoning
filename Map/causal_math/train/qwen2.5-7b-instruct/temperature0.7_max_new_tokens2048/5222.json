  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a function \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a transformation through a Laplace Transform, represented by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = X(s) \\). Afterward, an inverse operation is applied via \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{X(s)\\} \\) over numeric domain s, using a different parameter set \\( p \\).\n\nGiven \\( x(t) \\) at the end of the transformations, can we determine if the intermediate transformations (Laplace and its inverse) were standard without any additional intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Since the inverse Laplace Transform perfectly recovers \\( x(t) \\) if and only if it is the exact mathematical counterpart to the initial Laplace Transform and no intermediate alterations occur, observing \\( x(t) \\) intact permits inferring the absence of additional interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
