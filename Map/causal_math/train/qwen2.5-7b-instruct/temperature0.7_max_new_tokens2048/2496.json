  "Problem": "Consider a physical system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = 0 \\\\) in a region R. An external force is modelled by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) that modifies the boundary conditions of R at time t = 0. We analyze the effect of this initial condition and subsequent interventions on the solution u(x, y, t) across the domain.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( u(x, y, T) \\\\), can we exclusively determine the initial boundary condition \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) if there was an unknown intervention at some time t1 before T?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of whether there was an intervention, or what that intervention was (\\\\( k(x, y) \\\\)), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial boundary condition \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) based on the solution at time T, due to the additional variable introduced during the evolution.",
