  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex numbers, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are complex constants. The function’s evolution over time is analyzed considering linear transformations and their implications on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(0) = x + y \\\\) and the system evolves according to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the system at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) simply be the sum of the individual transformations applied to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the exponentiation function in the definition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ensures that the final state at time \\\\( T \\\\) is straightforwardly the sum of the transformations applied to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) separately. Therefore, \\\\( z(T) = e^{AT}x + e^{BT}y \\\\) directly results from the individual contributions of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
