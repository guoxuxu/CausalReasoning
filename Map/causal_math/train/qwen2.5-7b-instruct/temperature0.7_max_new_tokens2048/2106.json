  "Problem": "Analyzing a system governed by a set of differential equations, \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and \\(u\\) represents an external control input related via the transformation \\\\(u(t) = D(t)z + E(t)\\) where D and E are matrix functions of time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can one definitively deduce the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) and the initial transformation \\(u(0) = D(0)z_0 + E(0)\\) without additional information about \\(D(t)\\) and \\(E(t)\\) during the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory that brings \\\\(z\\) to state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on the integrative effects of M, N, D(t), and E(t) over time. Without precise information on how \\(u(t)\\) was governed by \\(D(t)\\) and \\(E(t)\\), distinct combinations could yield the same final state, rendering a unique backward deduction impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z at time T is influenced by the initial state z(0) and the transformation functions D and E through the differential equation. The control input u at any time t is caused by D and E, which are time-dependent. The initial control input u(0) depends on the initial state z(0) and the transformation functions D and E."
