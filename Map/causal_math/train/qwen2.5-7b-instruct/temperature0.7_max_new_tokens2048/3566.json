  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We study the effect of the Laplace transform applied to \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its subsequent inverse transformation using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\) rather than \\\\( a \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original parameter \\\\( a \\\\) after observing the transformation of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) back to time domain using the inverse Laplace transform with parameter \\\\( a \\\\), without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since the original function and its transform properties uniquely determine \\\\( a \\\\), applying the inverse transformation correctly implies the uniqueness of \\\\( a \\\\). The value of \\\\( a \\\\) can be uniquely inferred if the process and parameter match.",
