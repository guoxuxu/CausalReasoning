  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is produced by applying a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The output is then transformed by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze how these transformations affect the relationship between input and output over time t.\n\nGiven the final output at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we identify precisely which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used, solely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the precise transformations used from the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the potential for multiple, different transformation sequences resulting in the same final state, especially when dealing with exponential functions in the transformations. The interplay and cumulative effect of potential transformations make it difficult to pinpoint a specific transformation history conclusively.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) and the impulse response h(t) determine the output signal z(t) at any time t. The transformation f(z) applied to z(t) results in z(T) at time T, and this transformation is necessary to obtain z(T) from z(t)."
