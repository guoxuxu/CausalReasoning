  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output state z depends on the input state x through the transformation given by z = Sx, where S is a complex transformation matrix. We consider the influence of multiplying complex eigenvalues in the matrix S analyzed over variable changes.\n\nConsidering the output z after interventions (multiplying S by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and adding K), can we precisely determine the sequence or types of interventions applied by only observing the final output z?",
  "Explanation": "The output z could potentially be achieved through various combinations of scaling and matrix addition or different sequences thereof. Without further information about the interventions, the effects are not distinguishable solely based on the output, thus reinforcing the non-unique resolution of the transformation procedures.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation matrix S, the eigenvalue λ, and the vector K each contribute to determining the output z. Interventions on S, λ, or K will affect z, but observing z alone does not precisely determine the sequence or types of interventions applied."
