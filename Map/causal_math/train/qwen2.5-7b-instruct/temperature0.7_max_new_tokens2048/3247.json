  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. This function models a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane over time t. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function and then examining the implications of manipulations in the frequency domain.\n\nIf we alter the Fourier domain representation by filtering out all frequencies except \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and then apply an inverse Fourier transform, will the resulting function still represent \\\\( z(t) \\\\) exactly as the original?",
  "Explanation": "Filtering to retain only the \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) component and then performing an inverse Fourier transform ideally reconstructs the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), assuming no loss or alteration occurs in the process of these transformations.",
