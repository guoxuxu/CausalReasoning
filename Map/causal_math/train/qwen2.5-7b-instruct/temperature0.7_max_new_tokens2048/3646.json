  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant complex number. Study the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nCan we accurately trace back to the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the specific transformation applied \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition in such a way that it might incorporate transformations of the integral over time, encompassing phase shifts and scaling influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of these transformations, reconstructing the original \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is not feasible due to the loss of initial phase information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)) is caused by the term iωz(t) + α. The initial value of z at t=0 influences z at any time t. z at time t influences the integral transformation T(z). T(z) at time T reflects the integral of z from 0 to T."
