  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of applying an initial temperature distribution using the transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for some t = T, can we accurately conclude the exact form of the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was specifically \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\) without knowing it was set this way?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature distribution at a later time, \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), is the result of the diffusion process and can possibly match the distribution resulting from different initial conditions due to the nature of heat diffusion. Without additional information or constraints, multiple initial conditions can lead to similar distributions at a later time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
