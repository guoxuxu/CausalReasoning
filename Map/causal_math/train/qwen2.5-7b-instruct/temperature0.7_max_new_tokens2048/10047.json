  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) in the complex plane, where A is a real constant and i represents the imaginary unit. The function describes rotation around the origin with angular velocity A. We explore different transformations involving the operator \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, and examine the trajectories and causality in this rotating system.\n\nSuppose an intervention changes the angular velocity to \\\\( iBt \\\\) at a time t_1, and \\\\( B \\\\neq A \\\\), would the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward purely reflect the new velocity rather than any influence from the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the angular velocity changes to \\\\( iBt \\\\), the impact of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influences the subsequent trajectory. The state not only rotates with a new velocity but from a position already altered by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making its evolution a combined effect of both the initial condition and the new velocity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular velocity A/B directly influences the evolution of z(t) after time t_1. The time t_1 marks a shift in the angular velocity from A to B, causing the trajectory of z(t) to reflect only the new velocity B thereafter."
