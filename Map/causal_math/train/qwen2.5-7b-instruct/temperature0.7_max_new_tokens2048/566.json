  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real variable. We explore the impact of the Laplace transform on this function, given by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), can we determine the value of \\\\( a \\\\) without any knowledge about the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From the result of the Laplace transform, expressed as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), it is possible to directly identify \\\\( a \\\\) as the singularity in the transformed function. Therefore, the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) can be inferred definitively from the transform output.",
