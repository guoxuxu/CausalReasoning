  "Problem": "Analyzing a system driven by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + k \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where k is a wave speed constant. The influence of a transformation characterized by \\\\( T(u) = u e^{-ikx} \\\\) is tested, which can affect how solutions are represented in the complex domain.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then the solution evolves according to the PDE without further changes, will the form of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at any later time \\\\( t > 0 \\\\) remain altered compared to no application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(u) \\\\) introduces a phase shift in the initial conditions which evolves with the system. This modification does not dissipate without intervention, affecting the solution's form throughout the propagation due to the translation in the x-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
