  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} z(0) \\\\), where A is a constant real number representing the angular frequency. This transformation is an example of a complex rotation in the time domain.\n\nFor a given initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), if allowed to freely evolve under the given transformation without any intervention, will the argument (angle in the complex plane) of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on A and the initial argument of \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z(0) \\\\) essentially rotates the initial vector \\\\( z(0) \\\\) in the complex plane by an angle of \\\\( AT \\\\) radians. Therefore, the argument of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T is a direct result of the angle added by the rotation due to A and the initial argument of \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The output trajectory exclusively depends on A and the initial state's argument.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
