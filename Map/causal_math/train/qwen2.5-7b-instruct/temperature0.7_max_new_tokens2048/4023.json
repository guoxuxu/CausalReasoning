  "Problem": "Assume the function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number, represents a physical process. We explore the effects of the operation \\( h(z) = e^{kt}z \\) on \\( z(t) \\), with \\( k \\) being another real constant.\n\nIf another operation \\( j(z) = e^{-kt}z \\) is applied at a time \\( t_1 \\), will the resultant state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) only depend on the properties of \\( \\omega \\) and not on previous transformations with \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional operation \\( j(z) \\) influences the system depending on its timing and magnitude relative to \\( k \\). As both \\( e^{kt} \\) and \\( e^{-kt} \\) affect the scaling and rotation of the state, the final system state \\( z(T) \\) remains dependent on both parameters \\( \\omega \\) and \\( k \\), influencing how the state was altered both before and after \\( t_1 \\).",
