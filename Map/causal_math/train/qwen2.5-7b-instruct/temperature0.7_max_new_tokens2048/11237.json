  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where C is a real constant representing frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) is studied over the interval \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) followed by the evolution under the original differential equation without any further intervention, would \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T diverge from the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same differential equation but without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the starting trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating the oscillatory effects influenced by the factor \\\\( e^{-iCs} \\\\), thus diverging the path from that of the untransformed initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z(0) directly influences z(t) through both the differential equation and the integral transformation f(z). The application of f(z) modifies z(t) such that it diverges from the evolution of z(0) under the differential equation alone."
