  "Problem": "Consider a hypothetical physical system where the state of the system \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a constant matrix. We analyze the influence of changing the basis of the state vector using the transformation \\\\( T(x) = Px \\\\), where P is a matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\), the transformation \\\\( Px \\\\) might modify the state in a way that is non-invertible without knowing P, especially if P and D do not commute. Hence, the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of the system x(t) is determined by the initial state x_0 and the constant matrix D. The transformation T affects how x(t) is observed but does not directly influence x(t) itself. Knowing x(t) at time t=T allows us to infer x_0 if D and T are known."
