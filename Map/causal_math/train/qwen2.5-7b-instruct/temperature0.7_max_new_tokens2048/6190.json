  "Problem": "Consider the analytical solution of the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) under initial conditions that can be represented as a Fourier transform. An operation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we determine the original initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at some time t without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to reliably separate the contributions of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and the added \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) term from the observed temperature distribution, because both evolve under the same heat equation but could form indistinguishable effects depending on their specific forms and the properties of the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
