  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) and then studying its behavior under this transformation.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) to the original function is unknown, deducting the exact form of \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from its transformed state after evolution is infeasible because the inverse transformation and the effect of the operator in the transformed domain may not be uniquely reversible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
