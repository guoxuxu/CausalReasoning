  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{mt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another complex constant) is introduced as an intervention, will the modified state at any later time T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and only reflect the last transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by both transformations due to the compounded effects of complex exponentials \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{mt} \\\\), showcasing a dependency on both the initial and intervened transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
