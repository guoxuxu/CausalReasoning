  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanical system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a time-independent Hamiltonian H. We study the effect of applying a linear operator \\\\( U = e^{-iHt} \\\\) on the state vector at different times.\n\nGiven the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to determine uniquely whether the transformation \\\\( U \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( U \\\\) and the natural evolution under the Schrödinger equation produce the same result, it is impossible to determine post hoc whether the initial application of \\\\( U \\\\) occurred, as both scenarios yield the same end state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the unitary operator U at time t transforms the state vector ψ(T) at time T. The Hamiltonian H determines U, and the time t specifies when U is applied."
