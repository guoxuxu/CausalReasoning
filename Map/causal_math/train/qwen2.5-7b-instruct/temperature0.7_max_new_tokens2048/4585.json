  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x)e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x)\\\\) is a spatial profile and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of oscillation. The function represents a wave-like solution to the wave equation. We apply a Fourier transform in time, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\), to derive frequency domain characteristics and investigate potential changes induced by a spatial transformation \\\\(G(x) = x^2\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\(t=0\\\\) we apply the transformation \\\\(G(x)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x)\\\\) to obtain \\\\(u'(x) = u(x^2)\\\\), and then let the wave evolve normally, does the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) change as a result?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the wave function \\\\(z(x,t)\\\\) is determined by the temporal part \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) and is not affected by transformations applied to the spatial profile \\\\(u(x)\\\\). Although the spatial profile changes, the frequency component remains the same as it is a property inherent to the temporal part of the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation G(x) → u'(x) does not directly cause a change in the frequency ω, as ω is inherent to the original function z(x, t) = u(x)e^(iωt) and is not affected by spatial transformations of u(x)."
