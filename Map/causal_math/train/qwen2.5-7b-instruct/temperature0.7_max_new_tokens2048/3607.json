  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\beta \\\\) is a constant different from \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be only dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive interventions with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) add layers of complexity due to exponential scaling factors affecting both the magnitude and the trajectory phase. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on \\\\( \\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\beta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
