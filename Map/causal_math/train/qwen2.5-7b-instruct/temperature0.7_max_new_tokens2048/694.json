  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the function \\\\( V(t) = L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI \\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(I\\\\) is current as a function of time. An integral transform (Laplace Transform) is applied to shift the problem into the complex frequency domain as \\\\( V(s) = (Ls + R)I(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we unambiguously recover \\\\( I(t) \\\\) from \\\\( I(s) \\\\), determined by \\\\( V(s) = (Ls + R)I(s) \\\\), without knowledge of whether any initial conditions or other transformations were used?",
  "Explanation": "No, because we require knowledge of the initial conditions (e.g., initial current or voltage) to correctly apply the inverse transform. Without this, the recovery of \\\\( I(t) \\\\) from \\\\( I(s) \\\\) will remain ambiguous due to the possibility of multiple configurations leading to the same Laplace Transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
