  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane function defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{f(z)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) and a, b, c are complex numbers. Investigate the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = dz + e \\\\) on z, where d and e are also complex numbers, on the mapping of the function w.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied without any further changes, will \\\\( w(T(z_0)) \\\\) at any given \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) under \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the input to the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( w(dz_0 + e) \\\\), which generally differs from \\\\( w(z_0) \\\\) due to the non-linearity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in the exponential function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(z) to z0 and then the function w to the result is equivalent to directly applying the function f to z0 and then w, because w(z) = e^f(z)."
