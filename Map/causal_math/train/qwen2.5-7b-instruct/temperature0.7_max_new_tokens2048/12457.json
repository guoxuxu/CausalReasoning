  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of the function over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a function, can it be uniquely used to determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming convergence and proper conditions, the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformation encodes all necessary information about the original function within its domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform Z(s) of a function can be used to determine z(t) up to a certain extent, but this requires knowledge of the original function's form since multiple functions can have the same Z(s). The Laplace Transform s → Z(s) converts the time domain function z(t) into the frequency domain."
