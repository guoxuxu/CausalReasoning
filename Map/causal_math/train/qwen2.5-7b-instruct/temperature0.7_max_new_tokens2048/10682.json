  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ x(t) \\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its response to the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) expressed by \\\\( U(s) \\\\). The system’s impulse response is \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ h(t) \\\\} \\\\), relating the input and output through \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nCan the original form of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\), determining the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) solely from the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is ambiguous unless additional information about \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is provided. The output could theoretically result from various combinations of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( U(s) \\\\), due to the properties of convolution.",
