  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate how transformations defined by the integral transformation \\\\(T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{\\\\alpha s} f(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with constant \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), affect the function over time t.\n\nHaving observed the outcome of the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T, can we precisely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation modifies the function in such a way that it integrates all prior influences of both the exponential term and the original function up to time t. This accumulation means the exact original state at any earlier time, specifically t = 0, cannot be confidently reverse-engineered solely from knowing \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T without additional information about \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of T[z](t) depends on the integral of z(s) from 0 to t, with the transformation constant alpha influencing the integral; z(t) is determined by the initial condition at t=0, which affects T[z](t); the variable t advances over time, impacting T[z](t]; the constant alpha modifies the rate of transformation, affecting T[z](t]; the constant omega sets the frequency of z(t), but does not directly influence T[z](t)"
