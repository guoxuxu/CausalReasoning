  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system is initially affected by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to the state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T differ from the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same equation without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) alters the state at time t = 0, which subsequently affects the entire trajectory of the solution. The presence of the complex exponential matrix \\\\( A \\\\) can change both magnitude and direction of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), leading to a different outcome at any subsequent time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
