  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We apply a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is a diagonal matrix representing an integral transform.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under both \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be identical to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under its respective differential equations to T?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) alters both the real and imaginary components' initial conditions. The transformation by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) can change the trajectories of x and y distinctly, especially as C may affect the scaling and rotation components differently than A or B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state of x and y at t=0 influences their states at any future time t through the differential equations; the constant matrices A and B determine how x and y evolve over time; the diagonal matrix C, through the transformation f(z), scales the evolution of z but does not alter the fundamental relationship between the initial conditions and the differential equations."
