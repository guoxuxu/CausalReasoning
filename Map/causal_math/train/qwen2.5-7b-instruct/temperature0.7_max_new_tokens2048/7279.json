  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( \\mathcal{G}[u(x, t)] \\) is applied as an intervention, and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) is a Laplace transform, will the final state \\( u(x, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) only depend on the evolution under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) and not on the effects of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) introduces a transformation that, in conjunction with \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), alters the state of the system in both the frequency and complex plane domains. The endpoint \\( u(x, T) \\) will depend on all transformations applied (both \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\)) and the initial PDE dynamics.",
