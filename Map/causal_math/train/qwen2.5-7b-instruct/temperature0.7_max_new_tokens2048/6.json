  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the dynamic behavior is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), with \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) as constant matrices and \\\\(u\\\\) the control input. We test the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(v) = P v\\\\) where \\\\(P\\\\) is another constant matrix, on the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nGiven the system's state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we conclusively deduce if the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was applied only to the initial control input \\\\(u_0\\\\) without further modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Even when observing \\\\(x(T)\\\\) under the influence of \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\), the effect of the initial transformation on \\\\(u_0\\\\) might be convoluted with other dynamic interactions in the system, making it impossible to confidently assert the presence of the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) solely based on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
