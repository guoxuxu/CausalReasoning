  "Problem": "Consider the evolution of a complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) under transformation by integration against a kernel function \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\), where \\\\( z, s \\\\) are complex variables. The transformation is described by \\\\( w'(z) = \\\\int_D K(z, s) w(s) ds \\\\). Assume that \\\\( K \\\\) modifies how the function behaves in the domain differently based on its parameters.\n\nGiven the observed final state \\\\( w(z) \\\\) in domain \\\\( D \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine whether the original kernel transformation \\\\( K \\\\), the later kernel \\\\( K_2 \\\\), or both were applied based solely on the value of \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) could potentially emerge from various combinations of kernel applications due to overlapping effects and potential similarity in the integral transformations imposed by \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\). Thus, determining the exact sequence or type of kernel applications solely from \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
