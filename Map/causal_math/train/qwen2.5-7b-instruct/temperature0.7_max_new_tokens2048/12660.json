  "Problem": "Consider a scenario wherein we have a Hilbert space and a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined on this space. The function \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied to any function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) in the space, and then the operator operates on \\\\( h(f(x)) \\\\). Furthermore, we consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and check how applying this transform affects the linear operation.\n\nIf \\\\( h(f(x)) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then allowed to operate under \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will the result be the same as directly applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) followed by squaring the output?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(f(x)) = f(x)^2 \\\\) initially alters the function by squaring it before the operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on it, which can significantly change the outcome due to the non-linearity introduced by squaring. In contrast, applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) first and then squaring would operate linearly first and then apply the non-linear operation, leading to different results.",
