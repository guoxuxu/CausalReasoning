  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its effect on a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with D being a constant matrix. We investigate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(x) = Mz(t)x \\\\) where M is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine whether the initial state was \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). The transformation by M and the evolution under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) could result in multiple potential initial conditions leading to the same observed \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T.",
