  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in terms of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), such that \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a positive real constant. Analyzing the effect of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant. Observations are made over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nGiven the value \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it feasible to ascertain the precise interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) used during the interval [0, T], purely based on knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of complex exponentials in modifying the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can overlap, resulting in equivalent final states from different combinations of interventions (\\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) values). This overlap complicates the unique determination of which interventions were applied without additional information about the sequence or timings of those interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of z at time 0 influences z at time T; the constant A determines the rate of change of z; the constant B affects the form of the function f(z)."
