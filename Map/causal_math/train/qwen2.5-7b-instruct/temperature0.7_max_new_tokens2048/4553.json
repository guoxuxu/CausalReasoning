  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, and analyze its behavior under the integral transform \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i \\\\eta \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) undergoes the transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) without further modification, will the transform be unaffected by the choice of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the integral transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) directly depends on the interplay between \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the real part of \\\\( s \\\\) (\\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\)). Specifically, the transform converges when \\\\( \\\\sigma > 0 \\\\) and the oscillation frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) contributes to the imaginary part of the transformed function, indicating an influence of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) on the result.",
