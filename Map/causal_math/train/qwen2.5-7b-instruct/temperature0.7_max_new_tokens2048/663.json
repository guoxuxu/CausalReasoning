  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nIf an intervention applying a different matrix \\\\( N \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is introduced, will the format and properties of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( N \\\\) can change the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting both the magnitude and the phase of the complex exponential. The result at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends critically on both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), in addition to the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Different combinations of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) can markedly alter the final observed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The format and properties of z(T) for T > t1 depend only on ω and not on matrices M and N, as z(t1) → z(T) implies that changes after t1 are determined by the initial state at t1 which itself is influenced by M but not N."
