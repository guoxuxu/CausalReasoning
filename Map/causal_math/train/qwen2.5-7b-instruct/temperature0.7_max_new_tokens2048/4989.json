  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a Fourier Transform \\( F(k) \\) applied to a function \\( f(x) \\). We analyze various scenarios where \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\), and ‘a’ is a real constant, to understand the impact of this transformation on the system.\n\nIf \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\) is transformed at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the Fourier Transform, will \\( F(k) \\) at a later time T be the same as if \\( f(x) \\) alone was transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\( e^{ax} \\) represents a modulation which alters the original function \\( f(x) \\). According to the properties of Fourier Transforms, this results in a frequency shift in \\( F(k) \\), which would not be the same as the Fourier Transform of \\( f(x) \\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier Transform to g(x) = e^(ax)f(x) at t=0 results in a different F(k) compared to applying it to f(x) alone, due to the multiplication by e^(ax)."
