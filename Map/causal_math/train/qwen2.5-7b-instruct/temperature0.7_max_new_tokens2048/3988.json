  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(w) \\) mapping complex numbers where \\( z(w) \\) is defined as \\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega w} \\), with \\( \\omega \\) being a real constant. We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( Z(v) \\) on \\( z(w) \\), defined by \\( Z(v) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(w) e^{-ivw} dw \\).\n\nGiven \\( Z(v) \\) after applying the transformation \\( G(w) \\), can we deduce both the original \\( \\omega \\) and the phase shift \\( a \\) solely from \\( Z(v) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\( Z(v) \\) provides the magnitude and frequency information but does not independently reveal the phase shift \\( a \\). The phase shift alters the result in a way that may not be distinguishable solely through \\( Z(v) \\), necessitating additional information to fully reconstruct the original function parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
