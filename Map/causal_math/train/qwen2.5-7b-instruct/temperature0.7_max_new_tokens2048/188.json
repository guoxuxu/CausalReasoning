  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) mapping complex numbers, where A is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the behavior of this transformation within the context of complex functions and their developments over time using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\).\n\nKnowing the end transformation result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(T)\\\\} \\\\), is it possible to precisely identify the sequences (if any) of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) applied only by analyzing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(T)\\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application and overlapping effects of exponential transformations under matrices A and B create complex trajectories that cannot be unambiguously reconstructed from the final Laplace transform. Multiple sequences of applications of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could potentially yield the same end result, leading to uncertainty in causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear transformation function f(z) or g(z) influences the Laplace transform L{z(T)}, but knowing L{z(T)} alone does not precisely identify the specific sequence of transformations applied."
