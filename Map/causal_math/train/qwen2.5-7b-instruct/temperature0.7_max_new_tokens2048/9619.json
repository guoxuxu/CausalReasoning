  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\). We examine the changes caused by performing a Laplace transformation on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) over time variable t, such that \\\\( L\\{z(w)\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w^2(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), assuming \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nIf a perturbing function \\\\( g(w) = w + C \\\\) for a constant matrix C is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution of \\\\( w(t) = e^{At} \\\\), will the final Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(w+C)\\}(s) \\\\) at any time T > t_1 depend solely on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(w) = w + C \\\\) alters the trajectory of the system by changing the state prior to applying \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\). Consequently, the endpoint of the Laplace transform will reflect influences from both A and C, altering the outcome depending on how C modifies the original path of \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix A influences w(t), which through z(w) affects L{z(w)}(s). The perturbation C changes w(t) to w+C, affecting z(w+C), which then influences L{z(w+C)}(s). At time T, L{z(w+C)}(s) depends on both A and C."
