  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), for some complex square matrix A. We evaluate the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also complex matrices.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine which interventions were used (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the final state value?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can stem from various combinations of interventions and initial conditions, especially if the matrices involve non-commutative properties. Differential manipulations made by \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( Fe^{Gt} \\\\) allow multiple feasible paths to achieve a similar end state, thus obfuscating precise inference of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
