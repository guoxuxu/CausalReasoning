  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix. To examine causal inference, we analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based only on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modifications by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) and their intervening matrices can create multiple possible trajectories that converge to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The interactions among \\\\(S\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(Q\\\\), and \\\\(F\\\\) matrices and their exponentials mean multiple transformation paths could result in the same state, obscuring the specific sequence or type of interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
