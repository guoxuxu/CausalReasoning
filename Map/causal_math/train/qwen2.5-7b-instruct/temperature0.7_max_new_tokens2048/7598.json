  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\phi & -\\sin \\phi \\\\ \\sin \\phi & \\cos \\phi \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) representing a rotation by an angle \\\\( \\phi \\\\) on the complex plane.\n\nKnowing the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we identify whether a rotation by \\\\( A \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since rotation preserves the nature of the trajectory on the complex plane, the rotated trajectory \\\\( Az(t) \\\\) still forms a circular path, indistinguishable from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, observing the nature of the trajectory at T does not reveal whether the initial state was rotated.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
