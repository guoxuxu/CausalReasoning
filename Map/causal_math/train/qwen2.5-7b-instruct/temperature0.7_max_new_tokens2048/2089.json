  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping from the complex plane to itself given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{az+b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate the effects of this transformation under the integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( w = e^{az+b} \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and integrated over a contour \\\\( C \\\\), is the result of the integral transformation the same as integrating \\\\( f(z) \\\\) transformed by \\\\( e^{az+b} \\\\) directly without applying the function first?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation changes the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) within the integral, influencing the integration path and possibly the endpoints of the contour depending on \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). This results in a transformation that is not equivalent to simply integrating \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then applying \\\\( e^{az+b} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
