  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane evolves according to the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. An external input transformation function \\\\( h(z) = ze^{iBt} \\\\), with B being another real constant, is applied at specific instances.\n\nCan the specific interventions (\\\\( h(z) \\\\) applied, \\\\( k(z) \\\\) applied, both or none) be definitively identified from the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) knowing only its value at that time?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely determine the sequence or type of interventions due to the similar effects potentially produced by different combinations of phase shifts under B and C. Overlapping outcomes from different transformation pathways hamper the identification of specific interventions purely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
