  "Problem": "Consider the functional equation \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}B u(s) \\\\, ds\\\\) describing a control system where A and B are constant matrices, and u(t) is a control function. Explore the impacts of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\(T(z) = Cz(t)\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nKnowing the final output z(T), can the specific interventions (whether T(z), S(z), or both) be uniquely determined solely based on the value at T?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of transformations T(z) and S(z) can yield identical or indistinguishable outputs at T due to the linear properties of transformations and overlapping effects on the system trajectory. This ambiguity prevents unique identification of which interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
