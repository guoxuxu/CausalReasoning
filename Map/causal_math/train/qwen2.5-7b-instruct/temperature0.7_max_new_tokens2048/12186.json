  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t) \\\\), where P is a complex constant. We study the effects under the integral transform \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Qt}z(t)dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant and T is a fixed time.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within \\\\( 0 \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) an intervention \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Rt}z(t)dt \\\\) (where R is a different complex constant) is introduced, will the consequent evaluation by \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\) be influenced by R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( H(z) \\\\) modifies the integral structure and thus changes the information within the system until \\\\( t_1 \\\\), impacting how \\\\( G(z) \\\\) interprets the function from 0 to T. \\\\( R \\\\) affects the aggregation within its applicable interval and inevitably influences the outcome of \\\\( G(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing H(z) influences the initial condition of z(t), which through P governs z(t). Q then determines the behavior of G(z) up to T, making G(z) dependent on R indirectly via its effect on the initial condition of z(t)."
