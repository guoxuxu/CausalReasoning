  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a particle's position in the complex plane. Assume the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An integral transform \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\) is considered to analyze the system at different instances.\n\nGiven the output at \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (either \\\\(f(z)\\\\) or \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or both) were applied during the evolution to time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlaid effects of the transformations \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) can result in similar or indistinguishable trajectories at time \\\\(T\\\\), making it impossible to definitively identify which transformations were applied based solely on the endpoint data.",
