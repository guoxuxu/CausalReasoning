  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\) on an interval \\\\([0, L]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(u(0,t) = 0\\\\) and \\\\(u(L, t) = 0\\\\). An external source \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is introduced, altering the initial condition to \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is the initial condition imposed on the system, and the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without any further intervention, will the solution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at a later time T > 0 be different from the solution without the external source?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition \\\\(f(x)\\\\) directly affects the subsequent evolution of the heat equation's solution. Given \\\\(f(x)\\\\) initializes the system differently than a zero function, the profile at any time T > 0 will inherently reflect this initial condition, leading to a distinct soft solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
