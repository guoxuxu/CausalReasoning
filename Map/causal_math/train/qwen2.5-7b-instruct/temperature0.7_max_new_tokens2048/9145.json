  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is a given kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is the input function. Analyze the behavior when applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is another function.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( x(s) \\\\) and then the result is input into the integral equation, does the solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) change compared to using \\\\( x(s) \\\\) directly without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) adds the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to \\\\( x(s) \\\\\\), altering the input and consequently changing the integral's value. Since the system's output integrates over this modified input, the resulting output function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will differ from the case without the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
