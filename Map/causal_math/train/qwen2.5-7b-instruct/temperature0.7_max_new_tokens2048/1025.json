  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real function of time t and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\), with A being a real constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T be affected by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) does not directly depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but the transformation to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) introduces a dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Although the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) itself follows its natural dynamics independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the observed output in the form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is directly influenced by the angular frequency, affecting the apparent behavior and phase of the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
