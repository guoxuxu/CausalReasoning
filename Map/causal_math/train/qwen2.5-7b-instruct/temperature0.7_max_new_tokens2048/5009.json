  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We evaluate the role of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Dt}z \\\\) (where R is a rotation matrix and D is another constant matrix) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to that obtained from evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Dt}z \\\\) changes the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), both by rotating and by potentially altering its scale and orientation, depending on the matrices R and D relative to C. This typically leads to a different trajectory for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time T compared to the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z_0) at t=0 and allowing it to evolve according to \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) until t=T results in the same z(t) as directly evolving z_0 to t=T under the original system, given that R is a rotation matrix and D influences the evolution through C."
