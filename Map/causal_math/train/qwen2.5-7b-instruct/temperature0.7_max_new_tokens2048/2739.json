  "Problem": "We examine a system governed by the heat equation in a rod, \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(x\\\\) is the position along the rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal conductivity. Consider an initial sinusoidal temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\pi x)\\\\). Suppose an external heating function \\\\(h(x, t) = H e^{-t}\\\\sin(\\\\omega x)\\\\) is applied, modifying the temperature.\n\nIf the heating function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is applied continuously from the start, will the temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > 0 represent a superposition of the initial condition's influence and the effect of the external heating?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of the external heating function, the temperature profile evolves as a superposition of the solution to the homogeneous equation and the particular solution driven by \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\). This results in a profile influenced by both the initial sinusoidal distribution and the external heating.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
