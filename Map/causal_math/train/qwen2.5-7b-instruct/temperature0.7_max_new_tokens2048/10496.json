  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nBased on the combined Fourier Transform result, can we precisely determine the form of the intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) if the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "Although theoretical decomposition is possible if \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( F(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\) add up linearly, distinguishing \\\\( F(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\) from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) can be challenging unless additional characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) are specified, such as its time of application, duration, or other distinctive features.",
