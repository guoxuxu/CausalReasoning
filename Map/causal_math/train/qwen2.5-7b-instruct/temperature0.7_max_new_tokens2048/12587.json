  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), noted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} \\\\). We examine how convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), whose Laplace transform is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system over time.\n\nGiven the resultant transform \\\\( M(s) \\\\), can we precisely infer the sequence of applied transformations (i.e., \\\\( G(s) \\\\), \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( K(s) \\\\)) based on the value of \\\\( M(s) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to before, the problem of deconvolution and factorization in the Laplace domain does not guarantee a unique solution. Different sequences of functions can result in the same final transform due to the commutative property of convolution. The ambiguity in potential sequences makes exact inference of transformations impossible from \\\\( M(s) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
