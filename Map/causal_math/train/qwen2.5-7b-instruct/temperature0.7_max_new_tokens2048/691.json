  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system undergoes an integral transformation with \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). The resultant transform modifies the behavior of the initial function over time.\n\nIf a function adjustment \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\) is applied at time t as an intervention, where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a modified frequency, will the resultant state at time T be solely influenced by the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not by the intervention \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function's frequency from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), which means the transformed state at time T under \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) will be influenced by both the original and the intervenient frequencies. The output will reflect a combination of effects from both the initial and the adjusted frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(t) → T[z(t)]; z(t+T) → T[z(t+T)]; z(t) = e^(iγt) → z(t+T) = e^(iγ(t+T))",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T[z(t)] is influenced by the initial frequency ω but not by the subsequent intervention γ. Applying z(t) = e^(iγt) at time t does not affect the resultant state T[z(t)] which depends on the initial frequency ω."
