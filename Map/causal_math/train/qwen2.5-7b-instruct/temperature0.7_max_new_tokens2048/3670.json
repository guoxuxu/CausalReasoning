  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyzing the system under the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we confirm that the initial condition was \\\\( z(0) = 0 \\\\) without knowledge of any potential intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) as \\\\( \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\) uniquely results from \\\\( z(0) = 0 \\\\) under the original differential equation in its Laplace-transformed state. Any non-zero initial condition would alter the numerator reflecting initial state contributions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
