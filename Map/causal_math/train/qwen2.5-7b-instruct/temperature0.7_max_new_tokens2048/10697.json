  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The influence of a linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\) is analyzed, with D being another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further manipulation, will the vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to just evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\). Unless D commutes with the exponential of M, the new initial condition \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\) evolves differently under \\\\( M \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T compared to the untransformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector z_0 directly influences z(t) through the evolution governed by M. Applying the transformation h(z) = Dz to z_0 at t=0 results in z'(0), which then evolves under M to become z'(t) at time t. Without further manipulation, z(t) is equivalent to the direct evolution of z_0 under M from t=0 to t=T."
