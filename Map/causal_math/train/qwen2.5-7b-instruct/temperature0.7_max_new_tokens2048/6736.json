  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) through different linear transformations \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane, and we consider the effect of transformations on this motion.\n\nCan we precisely distinguish if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the transformation \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both were applied at any point during the evolution from the observed final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations involving scaling and translation in the complex plane can yield similar or even the same final states. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from various combinations of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( d \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
