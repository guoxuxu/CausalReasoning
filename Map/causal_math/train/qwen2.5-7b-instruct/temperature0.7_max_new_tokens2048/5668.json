  "Problem": "Consider a continuous dynamical system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The transformation is defined by \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform \\\\( U(s) \\\\), can we determine uniquely whether the alterations by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\), or both, were applied, just by examining \\\\( U(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform \\\\( U(s) \\\\) could result from different combinations of alterations \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\), or even a single alteration by any combination of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The shifts in \\\\( s \\\\) due to \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) might overlap or produce equivalent transformations, making it impossible to determine distinctly which alterations were made.",
