  "Problem": "Analyze a system where the temperature distribution along the line, u(x,t), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where k is the diffusivity constant. We consider the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\), where v is a constant scalar added at a specific time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\), \\\\(h(u)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) can result from different sequences or types of interventions due to the nature of linear additions and subtractions on the initial condition and throughout the system's evolution. The endpoint alone does not provide enough information to uniquely distinguish whether only \\\\(g(u)\\\\), only \\\\(h(u)\\\\), both, or neither were applied, as multiple combinations could yield the same final temperature distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u(x,t) evolves over time to become u(x,T). The function g(u) = u + v, where v is a constant, can change u(x,t) to affect u(x,T). Knowing u(x,T) alone does not precisely determine if g(u) was applied, h(u) was applied, or neither, as it only shows the end state and not the history of interventions."
