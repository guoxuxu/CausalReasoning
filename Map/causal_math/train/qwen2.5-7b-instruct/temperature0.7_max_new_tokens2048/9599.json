  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The function is subjected to the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-s^2} f(s) ds \\\\). Analyze the implications of applying this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = z^3 + 1 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention prior to applying \\\\( g(f) \\\\), will the output of \\\\( g \\\\)(\\\\( f \\\\circ h \\\\)) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f \\\\) without considering the influence of \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will alter the input to the transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\), meaning that the output will not only depend on \\\\( f \\\\) but also on the applied function \\\\( h \\\\). The new function changes the behavior of \\\\( f \\\\) across the integration domain, influencing the final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( z \\) determines \\( f(z) \\), which then influences \\( g(f) \\). Introducing \\( h(z) \\) creates a new function \\( f(h(z)) \\) that, when transformed by \\( g \\), depends on both \\( f \\) and \\( h \\)."
