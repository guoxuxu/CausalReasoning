  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system where the evolution of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix. We are interested in how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) over time, where D is another complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine with certainty the interventions (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) applied to the system by solely examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectories leading to a specific endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be achieved through different combinations and timings of applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The nature of complex exponentials and their potential to have overlapping effects makes it impossible to conclusively determine the interventions just by observing the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
