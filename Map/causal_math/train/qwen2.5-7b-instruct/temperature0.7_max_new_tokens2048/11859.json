  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct} z(t) dt \\\\) is explored, where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final integral value \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the outcome \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final value \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\) results from a composite interaction of both transformations, \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and any intervening \\\\( G(z) \\\\). The overlapping influence of C and D through separate temporal segments creates multiple potential paths to the same endpoint, rendering precise backward identification of interventions infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
