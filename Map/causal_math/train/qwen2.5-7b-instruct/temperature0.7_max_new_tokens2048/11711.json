  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions describing a signal. The signal undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf a damping function \\\\(e^{-at}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a positive constant, is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before the Fourier Transform, will the modified transform \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\) depend only on the original \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), not on the parameter \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the damping function directly affects the time domain signal, leading to a convolution in the frequency domain with the transform of \\\\(e^{-at}\\\\). This results in a transform that depends on both \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) and the damping parameter \\\\(a\\\\), reflecting the effect of the intervention.",
