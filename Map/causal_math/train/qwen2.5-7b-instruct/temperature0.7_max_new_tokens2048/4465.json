  "Problem": "Consider a function described by a complex form \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the complex variable z, respectively. Let \\\\( u(t) = e^{-t}cos(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t}sin(t) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied defined as \\\\( T(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with a complex parameter s.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) at time T = 1, and then allowed to evolve further without intervention up to a final time \\\\( T_2 > T_1 \\\\) under the assumption \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), will the resultant transformed function at \\\\( T_2 \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) at \\\\( T_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) alters the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the integral operation and the complex exponential factor, which essentially modifies the frequency components and decays the signal over time. This change in the transformation upon re-application will result in a different output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The values of u(t) and v(t) determine z(t), which is then transformed by T to produce T(z(t)). Applying T at time T results in z(T), and allowing z(t) to evolve from T to T2 leads to z(T2), which is not necessarily the same as directly applying T at T2."
