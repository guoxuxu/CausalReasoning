  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear time-invariant system characterized by an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The output of the system \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is given by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\\\). We then apply a Fourier transform to \\\\( y(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Y(f) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) before it is Fourier transformed, altering it to \\\\( z(t) = g(t) \\\\ast y(t) \\\\), does the new Fourier transform \\\\( Z(f) \\\\) depend only on the transformation of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) or both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the original transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t) = g(t) * y(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( Z(f) = G(f)Y(f) \\\\) in the Fourier domain, where \\\\( G(f) \\\\) is the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Thus, \\\\( Z(f) \\\\) depends on both the new transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the original tranformations, confirming that the output in the frequency domain is influenced by all transformations applied successively.",
