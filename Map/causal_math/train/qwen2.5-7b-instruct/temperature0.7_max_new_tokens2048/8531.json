  "Problem": "Consider a heat conduction process governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( u_t \\) and \\( u_{xx} \\) denote the temporal and spatial second derivatives of \\( u \\) respectively, and \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The initial condition is \\( u(x, 0) = \\phi(x) \\). Analysis involves examining the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(s, t) \\) applied at t = 0.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a sudden change in thermal diffusivity \\( k \\) to \\( k^\\prime \\) occurs as an intervention, will the solution \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on the new \\( k^\\prime \\) and not on the original \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\) will depend on both the original \\( k \\) and the new \\( k^\\prime \\) due to the piecewise nature of the solution across the different intervals defined by \\( t_1 \\) and involving both thermal diffusivity constants.",
