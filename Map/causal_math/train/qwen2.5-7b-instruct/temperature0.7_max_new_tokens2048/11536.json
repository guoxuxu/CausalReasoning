  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in complex domain as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a mapping function given by \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\). We explore the impact of their composition \\\\( h(z) = g(f(z)) \\\\) and transformations related to the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the integral result from \\\\( \\\\int_C (f(z) + k) \\\\, dz \\\\) after an intervention added k to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we determine if the original function was intervened upon with just the integral result?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant value of the integral, assuming C is a closed contour, would be unaffected by k since the integral of a constant over a closed contour is zero due to Cauchy's Integral Theorem. Without prior knowledge of the function's modification, the result alone would not indicate the presence of the intervention.",
