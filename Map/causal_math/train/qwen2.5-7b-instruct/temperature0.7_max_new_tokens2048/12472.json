  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) representing a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\\\), and how it maps the function into a complex frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is initially set and allowed to evolve without intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\\\) at any future time point be the same as it was at the initial time?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function \\\\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) that remains constant over time as it depends only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the temporal evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which is a stationary process in the Laplace domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) causally influences its Laplace transform L{z(t)}, meaning changes in z(t) will result in changes in L{z(t)}. However, for z(t) = e^(iωt), L{z(t)} remains constant over time."
