  "Problem": "We explore the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z dt \\\\), where D is also a complex constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( J(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{Et}z dt \\\\) (where E is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( J(z) \\\\) as an intervention influences the trajectory of the state from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, impacting the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) through the new integral. This makes the end state dependent on the interactions of C, D, and E, particularly on how these matrices influence the integrated transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
