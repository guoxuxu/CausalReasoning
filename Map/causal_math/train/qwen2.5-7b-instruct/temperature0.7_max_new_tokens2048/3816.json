  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We examine the interactions between the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and a linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) on function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the final state of the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions, like \\( L \\) or \\( M \\), were used, based solely on the Fourier transform at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform outcome could result from varying degrees and combinations of interventions due to the complexity introduced by applying different operators such as \\( L \\) and \\( M \\). The non-trivial interaction between these operators and their parameters can yield similar spectral characteristics, making it impossible to infer the exact interventions uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operators L and M each transform the function z(t) through their respective operations before undergoing Fourier transformation, which modifies the resulting functions in unique ways that can be distinguished in their Fourier transforms at t = T."
