  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\alpha z^2 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyze the implications of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = z e^{\\\\gamma t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new modifying factor of \\\\( e^{\\\\gamma t} \\\\), making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interaction effects between \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), as well as the original dynamics defined by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). The trajectory and hence the endpoint will be influenced by all these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at any time t depends on iω through the term iωz and on α through the term αz^2. The transformations f(z) = z e^(βt) and g(z) = z e^(γt) introduce additional dependencies on β and γ respectively, but the endpoint z(T) for T > t_1 will still be influenced by iω and α due to their direct causal impact on z."
