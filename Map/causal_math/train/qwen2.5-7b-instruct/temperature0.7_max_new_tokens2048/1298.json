  "Problem": "We investigate a system governed by a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( A \\\\\\) represents a matrix with complex entries and \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) is a vector in the complex plane. The transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\\\) with a constant matrix \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) is then applied to \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial vector \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( t = 0 \\\\\\) after observing \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\), without knowing whether \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "With no information about the application of \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\), it is complicated to trace back to \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) accurately. The function \\\\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\\\) might alter \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) in a way that the changes induced by \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) could mask or modify the effects of \\\\\\( A \\\\\\), making the original state non-deductible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
