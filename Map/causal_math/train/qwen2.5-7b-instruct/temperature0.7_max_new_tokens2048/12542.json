  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) in a function space. We apply a Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(k) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x)) \\\\) in the frequency domain. The change in the system over time t is analyzed by applying the operator to \\\\( U(k) \\\\) exponentiated by a complex function, specifically \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)U(k) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega = ck \\\\) and c is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\), using a different operator \\\\( M \\\\), which also modifies \\\\( U(k) \\\\) in the frequency domain (e.g., \\\\( M\\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)U(k)) \\\\), will the state of the system at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the initial transformation or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( M \\\\) introduces a new influence that alters the final state in conjunction with \\\\( L \\\\) and the initial transformation. The cumulative effects of \\\\( L \\\\), the initial Fourier Transform, and \\\\( M \\\\) together determine the system's state at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear operator L, Fourier transform, and the operators M and time t to the function u(x) influences its representation U(k) in the frequency domain. An intervention at t1 with operator M changes U(k), but the state at T depends on the cumulative effect of L, M, ω, and t."
