  "Problem": "Let's analyze a discrete system defined using the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of a matrix A. Consider a complex function, \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - \\\\lambda_i} \\\\), applied to each eigenvalue and its effects on solving the integral, \\\\( \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{f(z)}{z - \\\\lambda_i} dz \\\\) where C is a contour encompassing all eigenvalues.\n\nCan you determine the specific eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of matrix A given the result of the integral transformation over \\\\( h(z) \\\\), assuming no other data?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral gives information about residues associated with the poles at \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\). However, without knowing the order of the residues or additional specifics from the integral's regions, determining the exact values of \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) solely based on the transformation's result is ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function h(z) transforms each eigenvalue λ_i, which in turn influences the result of the integral transformation. The eigenvalues λ_i directly cause changes in h(z) and indirectly affect the integral result."
