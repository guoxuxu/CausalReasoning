  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant thermal diffusivity. Examine the impact of applying a transformation with the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), or different times of applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\), could lead to similar or indistinguishable outcomes at \\\\( T \\\\) due to the overlap in potential trajectories and the linear nature of the heat equation. This makes it impossible to uniquely backtrack and determine the specifics of the interventions used, highlighting the complexity and the non-uniqueness of the results in nonlinear transformations applied to PDE systems.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) evolves over time T under the influence of thermal diffusivity k to produce u(x,T). The transformation function f(u) involving constant A modifies u(x,t), and the value of u(x,T) indicates the effect of applied transformations."
