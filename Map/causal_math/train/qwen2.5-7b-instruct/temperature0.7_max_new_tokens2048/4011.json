  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\) where \\(M\\) is also a diagonalizable matrix and \\(S\\) is the matrix that diagonalizes \\(D\\).\n\nAssuming that at an intermediate time \\( t_1 \\), the additional transformation \\( k(x) = e^{Nt}x \\) (where \\(N\\) is another diagonalizable matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( D \\) and not on \\( M \\) or \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of transformations \\( h(x) \\) and \\( k(x) \\) contributes additional dynamics through \\( e^{Mt} \\) and \\( e^{Nt} \\). The final state \\( x(T) \\) becomes influenced by \\( M \\), \\( N \\) as well as \\( D \\), affecting the evolution and leading to a state that does not solely reflect the action of \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
