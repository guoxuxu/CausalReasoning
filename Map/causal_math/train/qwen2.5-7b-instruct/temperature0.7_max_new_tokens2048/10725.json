  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( t \\) represents time. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation defined by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\nWill the Fourier transform of the function \\( z(t) \\) yield a delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\) if no modifications are made to \\( z(t) \\) or to the transformation process?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is indeed a delta function \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\) centered at the frequency \\( \\omega \\). This follows directly from the properties of the Fourier transform of exponential functions featuring pure sinusoids.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) transforms through the Fourier process into hat{z}(ω), and the value of ω influences the form of hat{z}(ω), potentially yielding a delta function centered at ω under specific conditions."
