  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\), where L is a differential operator. Consider how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system's behavior.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if any transformations or interventions were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is invertible and retains all necessary information about the function, the initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) can be reconstructed from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) irrespective of how the solution was evolved, provided no additional transformations are applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The differential operator L acting on u(x,t) leads to the time evolution of u(x,t) with respect to time; the initial condition u(x,0) determines the state of u(x,t) at any time t; the Fourier transform of u(x,t) results in hat{u}(k,t); knowing hat{u}(k,T) allows us to infer u(x,T); the inverse Fourier transform of hat{u}(k,t) recovers u(x,t)"
