  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\\\overline{z}} \\\\), where A and B are complex constants and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of z. We investigate the impact of a subsequent transformation \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), where C is a non-zero complex constant, applied over the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( v(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane and allowed to evolve without further transformations, will the value of \\\\( v(z) \\\\) at any point \\\\( z \\\\) be proportional to \\\\( u(z) \\\\) at that point?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), for any point z, \\\\( v(z) \\\\) remains directly proportional to \\\\( u(z) \\\\) by the constant factor C. The properties and evolution of \\\\( u(z) \\\\) on the complex plane are preserved up to a scaling by C, with no change in underlying behavior or distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
