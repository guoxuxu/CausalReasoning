  "Problem": "Consider the discrete-time system defined by the equation \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Bx\\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(g(y)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(y_0\\\\) at n = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(y(n)\\\\) at n = N directly correspond to evolving \\\\(y_0\\\\) under \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\) till n = N?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(g(y) = By_0\\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the system. The subsequent evolution under the discrete system formula will then take this altered initial state forward, generating a trajectory different from that which would have occurred from \\\\(y_0\\\\) using only A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
