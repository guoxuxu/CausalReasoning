  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), with \\( M \\) being a complex matrix. Investigate how the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), affects the dynamics of \\( z(t) \\), where \\( s \\) is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf \\( Z(s) \\) is computed for an initial condition \\( z(0) \\) and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\) without further intervention, will the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) solely rely on the form of \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\( z(t) \\) is primarily determined by the matrix \\( M \\). As the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) \\) inherently encodes the dynamics dictated by \\( M \\), any observed behavior at time \\( T \\) follows directly from these dynamics without influence from external modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt). The initial condition z(0) directly causes the value of z at any time t. The complex frequency variable s directly causes the Laplace transform Z(s). Z(s) directly causes the behavior of z at any time t."
