  "Problem": "Consider the process of heat transfer in a one-dimensional metal rod subject to external temperature effects. The change in temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of the rod over time t and position x is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\) an external source changes the temperature profile to \\\\(u(x,t_1) = v(x)\\\\), will the temperature at a later time T depend solely on the thermal diffusivity constant k?",
  "Explanation": "The new temperature profile \\\\(v(x)\\\\) introduced as an intervention fundamentally alters the conditions from that instant onward. Thus, the temperature at time T, while depending on the diffusivity k, also significantly depends on the new profile \\\\(v(x)\\\\) imposed at time \\\\(t_1\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature profile at time t_1 influences the temperature at a later time T, and the thermal diffusivity constant k determines how this influence evolves over time."
