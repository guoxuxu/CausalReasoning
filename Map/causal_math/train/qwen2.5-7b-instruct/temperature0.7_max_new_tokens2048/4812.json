  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function's behavior when subjected to Laplace Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and its transformation into the Laplace domain, defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the implications of altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and its effects on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) showing a specific damping and frequency characteristic, can the knowledge of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)'s pole alone determine whether an exponential damping intervention was applied, and precisely quantify both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha - i\\\\omega} \\\\) provides direct information about both the damping factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The real part of the pole signifies the damping coefficient, and the imaginary part represents the frequency, hence both parameters can be uniquely determined from the pole location.",
