  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a vibrating string given by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the speed of the wave in the string and \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). An external forcing term \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is added to the system, resulting in a modified equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + F(x,t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the displacement \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at some later time T, can we conclusively determine the previous application sequence and form of force \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\), with the assumption that there was no other type of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple forcing functions could theoretically result in the same observed displacement at time T, due to the properties of the linear partial differential equation. Therefore, without more specific data (like full-time series data), we cannot uniquely determine the applied force history merely from a single time point observation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The external forcing term F(x,t) directly influences the second time derivative of the displacement u_tt, while the second spatial derivative u_xx also directly influences u_tt. The displacement at a later time u(x,T) indirectly influences u_tt through its effect on the wave propagation described by the PDE."
