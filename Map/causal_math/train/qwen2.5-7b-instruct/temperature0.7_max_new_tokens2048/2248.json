  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\) acting on a complex function \\( x(t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We examine the consequences of applying an Integral transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) over time t.\n\nGiven the final transformed output \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\), can we determine precisely what transformations (whether \\( z(t) \\), \\( u(t) \\), or both) were used, only by examining \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) at time t > \\( t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and superposition in the Laplace Transform and the complex exponentials, multiple combinations of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\eta \\) could yield similar transformations on \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\). The final output does not retain distinct markers of individual transformations, thus we cannot uniquely specify the interventions only from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the integral transform L to z(t) results in a transformed output L{z(t)}, which depends on the variable s. The function z(t) is derived from x(t) through multiplication by e^(iωt), and ω influences z(t) directly."
