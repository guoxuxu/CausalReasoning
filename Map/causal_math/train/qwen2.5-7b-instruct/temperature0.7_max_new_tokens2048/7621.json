  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by a linear differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. We investigate the effects of introducing a modified voltage source \\\\( V'(t) = V(t) + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf the modified voltage source \\\\( V'(t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the circuit is allowed to respond naturally without further intervention, will the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if the original source \\\\( V(t) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The modified voltage source adds an oscillatory component to the input, affecting the circuit's response. This change will alter the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\), resulting in a different current at any time T compared to the scenario without the sinusoidal component.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The modified voltage source V'(t) and the original voltage source V(t) both directly cause the current I(t) through the circuit. The inductance L and resistance R also directly cause I(t), while the frequency ω influences V'(t) which in turn affects I(t)."
