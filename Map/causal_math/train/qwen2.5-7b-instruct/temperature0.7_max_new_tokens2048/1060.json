  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined on the real axis, \\\\( u(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is transformed using the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(v)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\), is it possible to accurately distinguish whether the intervention was applied (i.e., adding \\\\( \\\\alpha t \\\\) term) solely based on this result?",
  "Explanation": "While the form of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(v)(s) \\\\) suggests an adjustment was made, the exact nature of the intervention (specifically the actual value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) cannot be uniquely resolved solely from this transformed result. This is due to potential equivalences in the Laplace domain when considering alternative combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) adjustments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
