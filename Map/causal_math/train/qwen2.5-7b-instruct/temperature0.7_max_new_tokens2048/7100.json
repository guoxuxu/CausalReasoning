  "Problem": "Analyze the implications of applying a Fourier transform to a signal and then filtering with a kernel represented by H(s), an analytic function in the complex frequency domain, on the properties of the signal.\n\nKnowing the time-domain form of the output signal and the filtering method (time-invariant vs. time-varying), can we accurately determine whether H(s) or H(t, s) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Differentiating between H(s) and H(t, s) based on the output signal alone is complicated due to the similar impacts they can have on a signal's time-domain properties. The ambiguity arises from the lack of unique signaling in the results that distinctly points to either static or dynamic frequency domain interventions.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transform converts a time-domain signal to a frequency-domain signal, which is then filtered using either H(s) for a time-invariant method or H(t, s) for a time-varying method, resulting in a filtered frequency-domain signal that is converted back to the time domain to produce the output signal."
