  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a nonlinear system characterized by the function \\\\( z = f(x,y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\\\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variables. We consider the application of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to variable \\( z \\).\n\nIf \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values are altered to \\( x'=ax \\) and \\( y'=by \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants, and then \\( z \\) is calculated without further modification, does this change the outcome of \\( g(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied after modifying \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the new \\( z' \\) will be \\( (ax)^2 + 3(ax)(by) + (by)^2 \\). The exponential nature of \\( g(z) \\) means small changes in \\( z \\) due to changes in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can lead to significantly different outcomes in \\( g(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The values of x and y directly cause changes in z, which in turn directly causes changes in g(z). Changing x and y through multiplication by constants a and b respectively will alter z, and consequently, g(z)."
