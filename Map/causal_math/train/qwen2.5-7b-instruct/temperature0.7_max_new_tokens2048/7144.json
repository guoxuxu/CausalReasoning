  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being real constants.\n\nGiven the final system state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to conclusively determine whether the parameters were changed at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), just from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a result of the complex interplay between initial conditions, the first set of parameters up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the altered parameters after \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The multiple influences and the non-linear dynamics preclude precise back-calculation to identify the nature and timing of interventions.",
