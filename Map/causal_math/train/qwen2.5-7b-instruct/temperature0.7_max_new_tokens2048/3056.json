  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time Markov chain with state space \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\) governed by the transition rate matrix \\\\(Q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -\\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\). We are investigating the effect of modifying transition rates with a scalar function \\\\(f(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed state probabilities at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we explicitly determine whether scaling functions \\\\(f(t)\\\\) or \\\\(g(t)\\\\), or both were applied, based solely on the final observed probabilities?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint probabilities at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) can be achieved through different applications and combinations of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and \\\\(g(t)\\\\), along with multiple possible values of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\). The overlapping effects of these interventions make it infeasible to uniquely identify which modifications were made solely based on the final state.",
