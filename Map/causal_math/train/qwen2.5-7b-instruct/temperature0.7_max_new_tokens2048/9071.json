  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are time-dependent variables described by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constant matrices A, B, C, and D. We investigate the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{st} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) using another transform \\\\( U[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t q^sz(s) ds \\\\) (where \\\\( q \\\\) is another complex constant), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on the system's differential equations and not the transforms \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a second transform \\\\( U \\\\) as an intervention modifies the evolution path of the system from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent not just on the matrix components of the differential equations but also significantly on the parameters and effects of both transforms \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\), altering the trajectory and outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state of z(t) at any time t depends on x(t) and y(t), which in turn are influenced by A, B, C, and D through differential equations. The transforms T and U do not directly affect z(t) but rather describe how z(t) has been integrated over time."
