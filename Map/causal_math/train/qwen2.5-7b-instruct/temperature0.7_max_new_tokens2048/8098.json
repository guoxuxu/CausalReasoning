  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( i\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is also a constant complex matrix, on the system over time t.\n\nCan we conclusively trace back to the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could have modified the original state in a non-invertible way, especially without exact knowledge of D and its relationship with C, making it impossible to definitively determine the initial state.",
