  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution condition.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and this transformed state is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further manipulation, will the final temperature distribution at time T, \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), be different when compared to solving the heat equation with the original \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) alters the frequency components of the distribution. Since the heat equation handles various frequency components differently due to the diffusion term \\\\( k u_{xx} \\\\), the evolution of these altered components will lead to a different temperature distribution at any future time T.",
