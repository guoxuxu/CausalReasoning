  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) with kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\).\n\nFrom knowing the state \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely identify what transformations (either \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) were applied at different times?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome observed in \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) might be achievable through various combinations or sequences of transformations, complicated by the temporal evolution under \\\\( L \\\\). The non-exclusive effects of integral transformations make it unfeasible to deduce precisely which were used solely based on the end state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of u(x,t) at a later time depends on the initial condition u(x,0) and the application of the linear differential operator L. The integral transform T also influences u(x,t)."
