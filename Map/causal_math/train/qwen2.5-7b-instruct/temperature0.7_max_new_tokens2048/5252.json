  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by Laplace Transformations, where an initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}\\\\), and an intervention involves multiplication by the function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer.\n\nKnowing the transformed result \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}} \\\\) after an intervention, can we accurately identify the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) used as the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific form of \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}} \\\\), it distinctly points out the application of \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\) during the transformation. This result is typical for the Laplace Transform of \\\\( t^n e^{at} \\\\), thereby allowing for precise identification of the intervention function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
