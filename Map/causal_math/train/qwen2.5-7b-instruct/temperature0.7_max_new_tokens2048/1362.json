  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a change in the variable s defined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(t) = t^ke^{At} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and A is a non-zero constant.\n\nIf we observe the transformation output \\\\( I(s) \\\\), can we determine whether the original function was \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{(A+s)t} \\\\) without knowing the value of k?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the output \\\\( I(s) \\\\) alone is insufficient to backtrack uniquely to either \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{(A+s)t} \\\\), especially without information on k. Both alterations in the exponential term and the power of t can significantly shift the function, thereby confusing the original form analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
