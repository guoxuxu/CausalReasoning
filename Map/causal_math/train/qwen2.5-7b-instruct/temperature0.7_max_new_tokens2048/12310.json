  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) evolved under the differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant. Investigations include the effect of executing a transformation given by the integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\), with \\( s \\) being a complex parameter.\n\nIf during evolution at a time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( \\mathcal{G}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-pt}z(t)dt \\) (where \\( p \\) is another complex constant) is applied, will the end state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend exclusively on the initial differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) represents an intervention that alters the development of \\( z \\) post-\\( t_1 \\). The impact imparted by \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) in conjunction with the original \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) manipulates the trajectory and final expression of \\( z(T) \\), making it dependent on both the transformations as well as the differential equation parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t is directly influenced by the initial differential system (c), the integral transform parameter (s), and another integral transform parameter (p). The value of z(T) at later times T depends on the values of z(t) throughout the interval [t1, T], which are influenced by the differential system, s, and p."
