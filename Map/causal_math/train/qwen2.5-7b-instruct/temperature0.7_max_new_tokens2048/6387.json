  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\). We explore the effect of a boundary condition transformation, where the transformation is represented by \\\\(g(s) = e^{\\\\lambda s}\\\\) applied along the boundary \\\\(\\\\partial D\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention changes the boundary condition mid-problem to \\\\(h(s) = e^{\\\\mu s}\\\\) at a specific boundary point, will the resultant interior solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) now depend solely on the new boundary condition and not on the original \\\\(g(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) inside domain \\\\(D\\\\) depends on the entirety of the boundary conditions and their history due to the elliptic nature of the Laplace's equation, which encapsulates global domain information. An intervention changing a part of boundary condition influences the solution but doesn't isolate its dependency to just the new condition \\\\(h(s)\\\\); prior state influences remain pertinent.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The interior solution u(x, y) depends on the current boundary condition, which can change from g(s) to h(s). The new boundary condition h(s) replaces the original g(s), thus the interior solution now depends solely on h(s) and not on g(s)."
