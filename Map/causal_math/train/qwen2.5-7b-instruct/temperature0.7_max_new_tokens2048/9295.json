  "Problem": "Suppose a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz + I(t)\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant complex matrix and \\\\(I(t)\\\\) represents a time-dependent input. The transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is another constant complex matrix, is considered.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Mt}z\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(H\\\\) and not on \\\\(K\\\\) or \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\), applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will again alter the trajectory of the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the combined effects of matrices \\\\(H\\\\), \\\\(K\\\\), and \\\\(M\\\\). Each matrix influences the evolution by adjusting the state of the system or the simultaneous action, hence impacting the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time depends on H and I(t); applying g(z) transforms z without involving K; applying h(z) at t_1 transforms z without involving M after t_1."
