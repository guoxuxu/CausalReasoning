  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact when subjected to a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 = e^{i\\omega 0} = 1 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) = (e^{i\\omega T})^n \\\\) at t = T be the same as \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega nT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\) applied at \\\\( t=0 \\\\) modifies the initial value to \\\\( 1^n = 1 \\\\). Hence, the evolution \\\\( (e^{i\\omega T})^n \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) correctly equals \\\\( e^{i\\omega nT} \\\\), matching the behavior of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega nt} \\\\) from the transformation property.",
