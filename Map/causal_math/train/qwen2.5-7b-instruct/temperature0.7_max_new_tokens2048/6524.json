  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze this function's impact when applied as a transformation within an integral, specifically for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nFrom observing the endpoint result of the integral after the mixed application of \\\\( a \\\\) and transformation \\\\( e^z \\\\), followed by intervention to \\\\( b \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we decipher accurately the points of modification and both parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral's result, influenced by changes at different segments and an exponential transformation, creates a complex output that does not allow back-calculation to determine precisely when and how interventions occurred nor the exact parameter values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) unambiguously.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
