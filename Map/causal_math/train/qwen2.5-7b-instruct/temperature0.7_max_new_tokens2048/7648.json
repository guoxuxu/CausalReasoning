  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\( A \\) is a linear operator and \\( b \\) is a vector. We examine how the transformation and its inversion, where applicable, affect behavior over the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{cz} \\\\), with \\( c \\) being a constant complex number.\n\nKnowing only the result of \\( L'(f(z)) \\) at a later time, where \\( L' \\) is another linear transformation, can we identify what prior transformations or interventions (like the change from \\( A \\) to \\( A' \\)) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in potential outputs resulting from different sequences of transformations and the complex interactions between \\( e^{cz} \\), \\( A \\), and \\( A' \\) make it impossible to uniquely backtrack and identify specific interventions or initial states from the final output of \\( L'(f(z)) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of linear transformation A on function f(z) results in L(f(z)). The subsequent transformation L' on L(f(z)) yields L'(f(z)). Changes in A or the introduction of A' will affect the resulting L(f(z)) and L'(f(z)), respectively. The constant c influences the form of f(z), which in turn affects L(f(z))."
