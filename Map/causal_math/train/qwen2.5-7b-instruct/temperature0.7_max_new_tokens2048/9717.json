  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) is used to describe the time evolution of a system in the complex plane, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value.\n\nDoes the function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), result in the same endpoint at time T as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without the square function?",
  "Explanation": "The squaring function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), which means the base trajectory is different. The evolution of \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) results in \\\\( (e^{iwt}z_0)^2 \\\\), not \\\\( e^{iwt}z_0^2 \\\\). These are generally not equivalent due to the properties and behavior of exponentials and powers in complex numbers.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z_0 directly causes z(t) through the evolution function z(t) = e^(iwt)z_0; applying the function h(z) = z^2 to z_0 at t = 0 directly causes a different z value than evolving z_0 directly to z(T) without the square function, unless wT is an integer multiple of 2π."
