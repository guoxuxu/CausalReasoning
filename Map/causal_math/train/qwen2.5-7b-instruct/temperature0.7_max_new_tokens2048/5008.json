  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping operation where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) representing the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specifically determine which transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution, just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The identical end states in the complex plane can be achieved through various combinations of rotations and scalings due to the different transformation paths and overlaps in complex function mapping, thus making it infeasible to unambiguously ascertain the specific interventions from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) is caused by the transformations h(z) and k(z) applied to z over time."
