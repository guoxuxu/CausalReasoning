  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int e^{-sx} v(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the behavior of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function at time \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the specifics of any transformations applied (either \\\\( T(v) \\\\) or \\\\( U(w) \\\\)) during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed state \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) could result from various combinations and parameters of the initial and intervening transformations, complicating the exact reconstruction of the sequence and specifics of transformations applied during the evolution. The overlapping effects make it difficult to parse out individual contributions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, t) changes over time (∂u/∂t) due to spatial diffusion (∂²u/∂x²), which is influenced by the diffusion coefficient D. The integral transformation T(v) applied to u(x, T) results in T(u(x, T)), but this does not necessarily provide information about the specific transformations applied to v or w."
