  "Problem": "Consider a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t)\\\\) where A is a matrix governing the system dynamics. The impact of a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{Ct}x(t)\\\\), where C is also a matrix, on this system is examined. The ODE system is studied under typical operation and after application of a transformation.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t=T, can we determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), or the specifics of C, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\(x_0\\\\) due to potential modifications on the initial state by the exponential matrix. Additional information about the application of C and its specifics is crucial for an accurate reverse calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state x(T) at time T causally influences the initial state x_0 through the transformation T(x), and the transformation T(x) causally results in the state x(T) at time T."
