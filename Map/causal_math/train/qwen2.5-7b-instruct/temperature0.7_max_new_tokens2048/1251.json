  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with constant coefficients A, B, C, D. An integral transformation defined by \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) dt\\\\) releases a transformed state over a variable S.\n\nIf an intervention using a new transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ut}z(t) dt\\\\) (where U is a constant) is applied at some time t = t_1, will the resulting state \\\\(f(z)(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original differential equation parameters A, B, C, D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces an additional transformation layer, making the resultant function dependent on the parameters S and U from \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) as well as A, B, C, D. The forms and interaction of these transformations modify state trajectories, evidencing dependencies beyond the original system parameters.",
