  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by complex function \\(\\Omega(z) = \\frac{1}{LCz^2 + RCz + 1}\\), where \\(L\\), \\(C\\), and \\(R\\) are inductance, capacitance, and resistance respectively. The response of the circuit is analyzed under the input transformation given by Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\).\n\nIf the circuit input \\( f(t) \\) is transformed via \\( F(s) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to evolve under the system \\( \\Omega(z) \\) without further intervention, will the output \\( Y(s) = \\Omega(s) \\cdot F(s) \\) at \\( s = S \\) be distinct from directly applying \\( f(t) \\) without initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\( F(s) \\) alters the input signal characteristics; thus the output \\( Y(s) \\) through \\( \\Omega(s) \\) will be modified accordingly. This can affect the frequency and amplitude response of the system, leading to a different output compared to if \\( f(t) \\) was directly applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal f(t) transforms into F(s) through the Laplace transform, which then interacts with the system function Ω(s) to produce the output Y(s)."
