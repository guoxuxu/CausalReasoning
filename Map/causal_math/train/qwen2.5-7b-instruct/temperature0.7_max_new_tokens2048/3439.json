  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( G(z) = e^{\\mu t}z \\) (where \\( \\mu \\) is a constant complex) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the original differential equation and not on \\( \\lambda \\) or \\( \\mu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) will be influenced by both \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) along with the original system dynamics governed by \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). The exponential terms introduced by \\( F(z) \\) and \\( G(z) \\) add compound effects that affect \\( z(T) \\)'s trajectory and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t+dt depends on z at time t and -iz. Applying F(z) transforms z but does not affect the evolution described by the differential equation. Introducing G(z) as an intervention changes z but the future value z(T) for T > t1 depends on the initial conditions and the differential equation, not on λ or μ after the intervention."
