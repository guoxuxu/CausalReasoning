  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\( V(x, t) \\), such that \\( i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\\\\psi \\). We explore how applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi(x, t)) \\\\) affects the wave function over time.\n\nIf \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi(x, t)) \\) is performed on the wave function \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) and then it is allowed to evolve under the original Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\) at time T be the same as if \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) was evolved directly to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the representation of \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) from position space to momentum space, altering how the Hamiltonian operator acts on the function, thus potentially changing the state dynamics and resulting in a different \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential function V(x, t) influences the wave function ψ(x, t), which is derived from the initial wave function ψ(x, 0). Applying the Fourier transform F to ψ(x, 0) produces F(ψ(x, t)), and allowing this transformed function to evolve according to the Schrödinger equation results in ψ(x, T). Without further intervention, ψ(x, T) obtained through this process may differ from the ψ(x, T) directly evolved from ψ(x, 0)."
