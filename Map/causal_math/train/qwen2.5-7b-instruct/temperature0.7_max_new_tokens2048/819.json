  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system with a controlled function \\\\(F(x, u) = A x + B u\\\\), where x is the state vector, u is the control input, A is the state matrix, and B is the control matrix. We are interested in the impact of a perturbation transformation \\\\(h(x) = Cx\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on the evolution of the state vector over time under the control strategy that minimizes a quadratic cost function.\n\nIf an additional control strategy adjustment using a feedback matrix \\\\( K \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be solely dependent on the original system matrices A and B, irrespective of the perturbation matrix \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention of applying the feedback matrix \\\\( K \\\\) affects the trajectory and final state depending on its interaction with all previous state transformations, including the perturbation by \\\\( C \\\\). The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on all these matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
