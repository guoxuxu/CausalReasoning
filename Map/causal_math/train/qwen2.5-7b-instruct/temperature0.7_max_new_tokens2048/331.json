  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the evolution of a function is described as \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant and \\( z_0 \\) a complex initial value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\), with \\( B \\) also a complex constant.\n\nIf a new operator \\( H(z) = \\int_t^T e^{Cs}z(s) \\, ds \\), with \\( C \\) another constant, is applied as an intervention at some time \\( t_1 < T \\), will the resulting \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( A \\) or also on \\( B \\) and \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( H(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) adds another layer of complexity and integration dependent on \\( C \\), altering the natural progression under \\( A \\). The resulting state \\( z(T) \\) will depend on the interplay and potentially non-linear superposition effects of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
