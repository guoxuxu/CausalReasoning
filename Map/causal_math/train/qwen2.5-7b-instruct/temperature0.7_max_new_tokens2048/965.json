  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial complex amplitude and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore causal relations incorporating the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + ce^{i\\delta t} \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) being a complex constant and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) a frequency.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = x_0e^{i\\omega 0} \\\\) and the system is then left to evolve under the original dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under the original dynamics to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by adding an additional term \\\\( ce^{i\\delta t} \\\\), which evolves differently due to the frequency \\\\( \\delta \\\\). This results in a different trajectory for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) compared to just evolving from \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The superposition of different frequency components will yield distinct outcomes at any given time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex amplitude x_0 directly influences z_0, which in turn directly influences z(t) and z(T). The complex constant c directly influences the transformed z as g(z), but z_0 does not directly influence z'(T) after transformation and evolution under the original dynamics."
