  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the displacement vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time t is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by the function \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), on the system behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the spectral properties of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T reflect the original dynamics governed solely by M?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation changes the domain of the representation from time to frequency, potentially altering the observable characteristics such as dominant frequencies and their amplitudes. This transformation does not preserve the time-domain behavior of the system under M alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
