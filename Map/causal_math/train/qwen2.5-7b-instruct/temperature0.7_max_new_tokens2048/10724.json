  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. A linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + \\\\alpha z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. We investigate how \\\\( L \\\\) affects the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely the initial function and the operators applied (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both) only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interactions between \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) can result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), due to the overlapping effects such as alterations in both amplitude and phase. The specifics of the interventions (such as the values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)) and the initial function may lead to different paths reaching the same endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)) directly causes the value of z at a future time step (z(t+Δt)). The operator L applied to z directly causes the value of z at time T (Lz → z(T)). The constant α directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)). The real constant frequency ω directly causes the value of z at any given time (ω → z(t))."
