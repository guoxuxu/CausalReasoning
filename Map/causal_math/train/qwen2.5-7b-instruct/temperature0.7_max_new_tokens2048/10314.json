  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We analyze how this function transforms through the integral \\\\( g(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{As} ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( g(T) \\\\), is it possible to exactly deduce the initial function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from which the transformation started, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given only \\\\( g(T) \\\\), it is challenging to determine the exact form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) due to the irreversible nature of the integral transformation over time. Multiple different functions \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) might result in the same cumulative integral output at T, especially since A is a constant matrix and can have non-unique exponential mappings.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
