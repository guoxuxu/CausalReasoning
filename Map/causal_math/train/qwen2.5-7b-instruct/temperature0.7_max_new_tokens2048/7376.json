  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The transformation specified by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to study the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the interventions used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) merely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to potential overlaps in the effects of \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) = e^{Kt}z \\\\), and their non-commutative characteristics, multiple combinations of interventions could result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This overlap makes it impossible to uniquely pinpoint which transformations were applied during the evolution of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of M determines the rate of change of z with respect to t; the initial value of z at t=0 influences the value of z at any time t; applying the transformation g(z) results in the final state z(T); the matrix N affects the exponential factor in the transformation g(z); applying the transformation h(z) also results in the final state z(T)."
