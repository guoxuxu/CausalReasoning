  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) which is transformed via a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. The function \\\\( f \\\\) maps inputs from a two-dimensional space into the complex plane, and \\\\( g \\\\) transforms these complex numbers over time t.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the output at time T, can one uniquely determine the original inputs \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\) used to construct \\\\( z_0 = f(x_0, y_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear and often chaotic nature of the transformation \\\\( g \\\\), multiple different initial inputs \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) could result in the same output after T iterations, especially when considering the complex squaring and additional complex constant term which obscure the reversibility.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
