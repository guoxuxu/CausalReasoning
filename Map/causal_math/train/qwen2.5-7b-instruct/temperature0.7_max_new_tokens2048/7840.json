  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant, and an integral transformation \\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\). We study how the transformation influences the properties of function \\( f \\) over complex domain.\n\nKnowing the result of \\( T[g \\circ f](s) \\) for a specific \\( s \\), can one determine whether \\( g \\) was applied to \\( f \\) before \\( T \\), or if \\( T \\) was applied directly to \\( f \\) without \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple functional forms of \\( f \\) and types of \\( g \\) can yield similar transformation outcomes under \\( T \\), it is generally non-trivial to backtrack uniquely to the application sequence. Moreover, the effects of \\( g \\) influencing \\( f \\) become entangled in the transformation results, leaving ambiguity without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T applied to function f produces T[f], which when further transformed with g produces T[g ∘ f]. Applying T directly to f before or after applying g changes the resulting transform."
