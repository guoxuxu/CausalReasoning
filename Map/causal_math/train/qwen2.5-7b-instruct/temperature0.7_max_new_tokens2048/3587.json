  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = pz' + qz \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants and \\\\( z' \\\\) is the derivative of \\\\( z \\\\) with respect to time.\n\nSuppose at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using another linear operator \\\\( M \\\\) defined as \\\\( Mz = rz'' + sz \\\\) (where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are constants) is applied, will the resultant function \\\\( Lz(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 depend strictly on the original operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the new operator \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a second operator \\\\( M \\\\) with its distinct effects (acting on the second derivative and the function itself) significantly modifies not just the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but also how its transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) will proceed post-intervention. The interaction between \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), especially in non-simple cases where derivatives of different orders are involved, creates dependencies extending beyond the initial transformation \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
