  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a circular path in the complex plane at a fixed radius of 1, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We examine the change in trajectory when this function is altered with a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is squared at t = 0, and then it evolves with the same \\\\( \\omega \\\\) for time T without further modification, will the function at t = T differ from that obtained by not squaring initially and evolving for time T?",
  "Explanation": "Squaring the function changes the frequency from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\omega \\\\) because \\\\( (e^{i\\omega t})^2 = e^{2i\\omega t} \\\\). This changes the speed at which the function traverses the circular path, influencing its position at any later time T compared to unsquared evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function z(0) directly influences both z(0)^2 and z(T). Squaring z(0) at t=0 leads to z(0)^2, which then evolves over time T to become z(T). Alternatively, z(0) evolves directly to z(T) without squaring."
