  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its influence on a real function defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}F(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex variable. We analyze how transformations and interventions using a separate complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) affect the output of g(x).\n\nKnowing the resultant function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), can we definitively conclude which transformations (\\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or combinations thereof) were applied during the computation?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the transformative effects of complex functions and the integral's sensitivity to changes in the path or domain (especially near singularities), multiple combinations of \\\\( F, h, \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) could yield similar results. It is difficult to isolate and identify specific interventions or transformations solely based on the output \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
