  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The behavior is studied under the transformation \\\\( T(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) on the complex function.\n\nAssuming an intervention applying a new transformation \\\\( U(x, y) = (ln x, ln y) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the output of \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( T(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\) modifies the state \\\\( (x, y) \\\\) based on the results of the initial transformation, leading to a dependency on both transformations. Thus, the output of \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) is affected by both the initial state and changes introduced by both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial transformation T(x, y) → h(e^x, e^y) and the subsequent transformation U(x, y) → (ln x, ln y) lead to h(e^x, e^y) → h(ln x, ln y), implying that the output of h(x, y) at time t = T > t_1 may depend on the initial transformation T(x, y)."
