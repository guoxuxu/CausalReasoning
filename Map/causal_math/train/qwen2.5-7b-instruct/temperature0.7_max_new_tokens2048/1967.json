  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) refers to time. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the function and consider intervention through an inverse Laplace transform at different times.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) corresponding to multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) is applied after performing the Laplace transform and before applying the inverse Laplace transform, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) still be recovered normally?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the system through the multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), which modifies the Laplace transform to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\). The resulting function from the inverse Laplace transform will then be \\\\( e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha) t} \\\\), not the original \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",
