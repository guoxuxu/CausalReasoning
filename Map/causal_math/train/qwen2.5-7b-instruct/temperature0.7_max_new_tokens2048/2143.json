  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where initial data points are mapped in a complex plane according to the function \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( i \\\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant, and \\\\\\( t \\\\\\) is time. We examine the effect of another transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\\\) introduced as an intervention, where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\), a transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t_1} \\\\\\) is applied, will the resulting \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) at time \\\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\\\) have its magnitude altered proportionally to \\\\\\( e^{\\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha) t_1} \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) scales the magnitude of any point by \\\\\\( e^{\\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha) t_1} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha) \\\\\\) is the real part of \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\). This results in an overall change in magnitude, directly proportional to \\\\\\( e^{\\\\text{Re}(\\\\alpha) t_1} \\\\\\), regardless of any subsequent transformations under \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\).",
