  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution along a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We inspect the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we accurately determine whether a Gaussian filter (or another transformation) was used as an intervention based solely on \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting temperature profile, \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), might be achievable through various transformations or combinations of transforms, making it infeasible to definitively identify specific interventions like a Gaussian filter without additional information about the transitional states.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
