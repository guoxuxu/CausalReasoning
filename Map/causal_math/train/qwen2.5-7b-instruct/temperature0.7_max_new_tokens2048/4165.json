  "Problem": "Investigate a linear system governed by \\\\( dX = NX dt + M dW_t \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Wiener process (Brownian motion). We hypothesize a transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Kt} X \\\\) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) being another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is left to evolve according to \\\\( dX = NX dt + M dW_t \\\\) with no further intervention, will the state \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to direct evolution from \\\\( X_0 \\\\) to \\\\( X(T) \\\\) under the given system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Kt}X \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by scaling and rotating the state vector, depending on \\\\( K \\\\). This initial change affects how the system evolves under the stochastic differential equation, particularly impacting how the noise term \\\\( dW_t \\\\) influences the state vector due to the different scaling.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
