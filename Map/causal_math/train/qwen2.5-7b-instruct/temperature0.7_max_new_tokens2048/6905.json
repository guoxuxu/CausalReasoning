  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the particle movement on a plane is determined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts of the particle's position at time t, respectively. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is used to analyze the frequency components of the motion.\n\nIf the trajectory of the particle \\\\( z(t) \\\\) follows a specific function without any intervention, will the spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of the movement remain consistent over the time if the same motion repeats in a periodic manner?",
  "Explanation": "Since the particle follows a periodic function, the Fourier transform, which breaks down the function into its frequency components, will consistently yield the same spectrum, reflecting the frequencies inherent in the periodic motion.",
