  "Problem": "Consider the mathematical system where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real number, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z(t) + e^{iBt} \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another frequency, is applied midway in the observation period, will the resultant Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) only reflect the initial frequency \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at any point adds a new frequency component \\\\( B \\\\) to the system. The resulting Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) will subsequently exhibit peaks not only at \\\\( A \\\\) but also distinctly at \\\\( B \\\\), reflecting the composite nature of the signal post-intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( z(t) \\) changes over time according to the rate of change \\( \\dot{z} \\), which is influenced by the parameter \\( A \\). Applying the transformation \\( G(z) = z(t) + e^{iBt} \\) does not alter the fundamental frequency represented in the Fourier transform \\( F(z) \\), which primarily captures the initial frequency \\( A \\)."
