  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of impulse action in a heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) on a domain \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative of u, and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian. The intervention is represented by applying a function \\\\( g(u) = u + h \\\\delta(x-x_0) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( x_0 \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) is set in the heat equation without any intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > 0 be solely governed by \\\\( u_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, in the absence of any intervention, the solution of the heat equation for any later time \\\\( T \\\\) is entirely determined by the initial condition through the heat equation's fundamental solution or Green's function related to \\\\( u_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) and the intervention g(u) directly cause the solution u(x,t) at any time t; the initial condition u_0(x) alone governs u(x,T) only if no intervention occurs, while h δ(x-x_0) introduces an impulse that affects u(x,t) for t > 0."
