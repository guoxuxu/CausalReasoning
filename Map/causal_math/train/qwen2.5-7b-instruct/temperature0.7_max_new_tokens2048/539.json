  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the relation \\\\( z(t) = L\\{y(t)\\} \\\\), using a Laplace transform L to convert the time-domain function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to the frequency domain. Assume \\\\( y(t) \\\\) itself satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{y} = Cy + D \\) where C and D are constant matrices.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( j(y) = e^{Et}y \\\\) is applied at a later time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_2 be purely dependent on the characteristic of the differential equation (matrix C) and not on D and E?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( j(y) = e^{Et}y \\\\) further modifies the trajectory of \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Thus, the overall output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interaction of the initial equation parameters C and D along with the intervention factor E, affecting the final Laplace transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
