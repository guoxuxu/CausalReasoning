  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a complex plane, influenced by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nAfter observing the transformed state \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to deduce the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing that an integral transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the integral transformation affects all previous states from time 0 to T and modifies them in a complex manner (involving exponential terms), it's not possible to uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) just from the transformed state without explicit knowledge of the transformation application.",
