  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a system exhibiting harmonic motion in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-s\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) with the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\) with no further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T still reflect the initial transformation by \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = 0 simplifies to zero as it includes no integration range, leaving the system to evolve purely under the harmonic oscillator's dynamics. The time evolution is solely governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), thus \\\\( F(z) \\\\) initially has no effect on the evolution.",
