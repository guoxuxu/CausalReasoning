  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior under the transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant, analyzing the time evolution represented by this transformation.\n\nCan we definitively ascertain the specific interventions used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) by analyzing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing only that the system's phase evolves according to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be reached through various combinations of magnitude changes (due to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)) along with the phase evolution, creating multiple potential histories of interventions. This makes it impossible to uniquely identify exactly which transformations were applied solely based on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
