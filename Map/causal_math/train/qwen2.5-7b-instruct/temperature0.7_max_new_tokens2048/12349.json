  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional transformation subject to the Laplace Transform (\\\\( L \\\\)) and Inverse Laplace Transform (\\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)) when applied to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\\\\\\\, where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven a solution to the transformed algebraic equation, can we uniquely determine the original differential equation (\\\\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation process performed by the Laplace Transform is unique and reversible for linear ODEs with constant coefficients. Each term and constant in the ODE contributes uniquely to the transformed equation, allowing for the precise reformation of the original ODE from its transformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform (L) of the original differential equation leads to a transformed algebraic equation, which in turn provides a solution that corresponds to the original differential equation."
