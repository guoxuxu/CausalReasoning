  "Problem": "Consider the balance of a linear mechanical system with mass, spring, and damper. The governing differential equation is \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} + c\\\\dot{x} + kx = 0 \\\\), where m is mass, c is damping coefficient, k is spring constant, and x is displacement.\n\nKnowing the system's displacement \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at a final time \\\\( T \\\\) and assuming an intervention was made, can we determine exactly what the force profile \\\\( F(t) \\\\) was?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different force profiles can lead to the same displacement at time \\\\( T \\\\) due to the superposition principle and varying influence of the mass, spring, and damper coefficients. Without additional information on these parameters and the system's earlier state, it's impossible to precisely identify the exact force intervention used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
