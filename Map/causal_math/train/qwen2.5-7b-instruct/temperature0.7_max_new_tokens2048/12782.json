  "Problem": "Imagine analyzing the influence on a solution space by the operator \\\\( T: V \\\\rightarrow V \\\\) in the context of linear algebra, where T is defined as \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) for a matrix A and S is a linear subspace of V which is invariant under T. Consider the subsequent application of a transformation \\\\( f(x) = Bx \\\\), where B is another matrix, to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in S.\n\nAssuming that at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another operator \\\\( g(x) = Cx \\\\) (where C is a different matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of the system depend solely on A with neither B nor C influencing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at a later time t = T is influenced by the successive transformations by B and C, as well as the applications of T. Since B and C each change the vector in possibly different ways that are not necessarily aligned with the transformations ordained by T, all matrices (A, B, and C) will influence the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T(x) → x'; x' → f(x); g(x) → y",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The operator T influences the state x', which then transforms under f to produce f(x). An intervention g produces a state y independent of the previous transformations."
