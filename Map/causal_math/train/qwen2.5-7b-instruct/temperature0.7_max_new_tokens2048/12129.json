  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a set of coupled differential equations. Analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( u(s) \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nCan the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be uniquely determined at time 0 after observing \\\\( z(T1) \\\\) at time T1 without information about whether the transformation by \\\\( u(s) \\\\) was applied during [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( u(s) \\\\) was involved, multiple transformations could yield the same resulting state at T1. The integral transformation could have altered the system’s trajectory in various ways, making it impossible to backtrack with certainty to the original state at time 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
