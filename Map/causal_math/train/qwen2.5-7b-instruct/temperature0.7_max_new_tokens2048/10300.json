  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to transform the contour of integration in the complex plane for an integral \\\\(I = \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), where \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is a holomorphic function and \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple closed contour.\n\nGiven the endpoint value of \\\\( I' = \\\\int_{g(w(C))} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) after applying both transformations, can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( w(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) were applied, only knowing \\\\( I' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific transformations basely solely on the final integral value \\\\( I' \\\\) is challenging due to the non-invertible nature of general complex exponential functions in this context and the possibility of multiple transformation pairs resulting in the same modified contour.",
