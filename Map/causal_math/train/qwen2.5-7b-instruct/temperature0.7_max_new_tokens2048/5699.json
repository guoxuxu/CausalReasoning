  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\) (where c is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will scale and potentially rotate the state vector depending on the value of c, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), c, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Due to the compounding effects of phase shift and scaling, all factors influence the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
