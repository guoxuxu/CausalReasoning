  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. Explore the effects of applying a transformation matrix \\\\(T\\\\) to both sides of the equation, resulting in \\\\(T(Ax) = Tb\\\\).\n\nGiven the solution vector \\\\(x\\\\) at some time \\\\(t\\\\) from the transformed system \\\\(TAx = Tb\\\\), can we infer the original system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the explicit knowledge of \\\\(T\\\\) and whether it was used, it is unfeasible to uniquely trace back to the original system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\). The transformation could have changed solvability conditions and other critical aspects of the matrix equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformation T to both A and b results in TAx and Tb respectively; if TAx equals Tb, then Ax equals b under certain conditions."
