  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the particle movement on a plane is determined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts of the particle's position at time t, respectively. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is used to analyze the frequency components of the motion.\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) obtained from the Fourier transform, can one uniquely determine the precise function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) assuming no interventions were made?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform provides the frequency components but loses certain phase information and cannot distinguish between different functions that might have the same frequency components differing by phase shifts. Hence, we cannot uniquely identify \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone.",
