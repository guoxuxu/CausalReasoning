  "Problem": "A vector field $V(z)$ in the complex plane behaves according to the equation $V(z) = z^n$ where $n$ is an integer. We examine the consequences of applying a transformation $f(z) = e^{i \\theta}z$ where $\\theta$ is a constant angle.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector $z_0$ after observing $V(z(t))$ at $t = T$ without knowing whether $f(z)$ was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether $f(z)$ was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine $z_0$ since any rotation by $f(z)$ could lead to the same end result $V(z(t))$ for different starting points $z_0$, due to the multiplicative nature of complex exponentiation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) results in V(z(t)), and observing V(z(T)) allows us to infer z(T), assuming the transformation f(z) = e^(iθ)z was applied."
