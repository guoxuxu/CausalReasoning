  "Problem": "Let's consider the probability density function \\( p(z) \\) that describes the distribution of a random variable \\( Z \\) undergoing the Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(z)e^{-i\\omega z} dz \\). We investigate how transformations in the time domain and frequency domain affect this PDF.\n\nKnowing \\( \\hat{r}(\\omega) \\), can we determine exactly whether the original function \\( p(z) \\) was used, or modified by an exponential, solely based on the value of \\( \\hat{r}(\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{r}(\\omega) \\) represents the combined effects of \\( p(z) \\) and the exponential \\( e^z \\). Without additional contextual or base-line information about \\( p(z) \\) and \\( e^z \\), it can be challenging to separately identify or confirm with certainty whether \\( p(z) \\) alone or its modification was utilized, due to the linear and additive nature of the Fourier Transform.",
