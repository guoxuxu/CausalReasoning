  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\(L[z] = z' + az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{ct}z\\\\) on this system, where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were made (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both) merely by knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) and the operator \\\\(L\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based on the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is challenging due to potential overlapping effects of \\\\(e^{ct}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{dt}\\\\). These transformations may yield similar or indistinguishable end states dependent on the values of \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\), as well as their interaction with the linear differential operator, making precise attribution impossible without additional contextual data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
