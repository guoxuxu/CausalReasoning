  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and output function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a system governed by the convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specified as \\\\( y(t) = x(t) \\\\ast h(t) \\\\). Consider two functions, \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h_2(t) = t \\\\ast h_1(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final output, can we determine if the intervention involved an integration of the input signal or a direct application of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through one of the impulse responses?",
  "Explanation": "The final output doesn't necessarily reveal whether the input was integrated before processing or, if so, through which impulse response the intervention was applied. The process of convolution with each impulse response can mask the effects of the integration, making it difficult to trace back the precise transformation or sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function x(t) influences the output function y(t) through the convolution with impulse responses h1(t) and h2(t), where h2(t) is derived from h1(t) through an additional integration process."
