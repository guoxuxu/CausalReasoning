  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega t} w \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The system under study is defined by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation on the system evolution.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( z(w) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z(w) \\\\) was applied, it is unclear whether the observed state at t = T has been modulated by the exponential term \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). The ambiguity in initial conditions due to this unknown transformation makes it impossible to uniquely deduce \\\\( w_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
