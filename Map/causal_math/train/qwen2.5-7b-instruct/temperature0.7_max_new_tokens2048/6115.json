  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem where the velocity field of the fluid, represented by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,t) \\\\), is manipulated through transformations \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\nabla \\\\psi \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a scalar potential function varying with spatial coordinates and time. The fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations under incompressible flow conditions.\n\nAssuming an intervention applying a different transformation \\\\( g(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) at time t = t_1, will the fluid characteristics at any later time t = T depend solely on the initial conditions set by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}_0 \\\\) and not be influenced by the transformations \\\\( f \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with transformations \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) introduce significant modifications through the addition and subtraction of gradient fields, affecting both the velocity and its derivatives. This alteration impacts the subsequent behavior and state of the fluid at time T, making the final state dependent on the nature and timing of both transformations alongside the evolving dynamics of the Navier-Stokes equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial velocity field \\( \\mathbf{v}_0 \\) directly influences the velocity field \\( \\mathbf{v}(x,t) \\) at any later time, which in turn determines the fluid characteristics. Transformations \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) directly cause changes in \\( \\mathbf{v} \\), but if they are not applied after the initial condition \\( \\mathbf{v}_0 \\), then the fluid characteristics at later times \\( T \\) will depend solely on \\( \\mathbf{v}_0 \\)."
