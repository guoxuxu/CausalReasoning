  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in a complex plane, described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. We introduce a transformation given by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, affecting the amplitude and phase of \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, and not knowing the values of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could alter the amplitude and phase in a way that is indistinguishable from the effects of pure rotational dynamics under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω directly causes the rate of change of z (z'); the complex constant α directly causes the transformation f(z); the initial state z_0 directly causes the state z; time t directly causes the state z; the transformation f(z) directly causes the state z(T)."
