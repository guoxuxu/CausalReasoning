  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We then apply a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, to the function at time t.\n\nIs it possible to exactly determine the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just by observing the evolved function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which fundamentally alters the initial function, it is not feasible to backtrack unambiguously to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The effect of B complicates the direct association between the observed final and initial states.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolved function z(T) causally influences the initial function z_0 through the transformation g(z). The partial differential equation parameter A directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time. The transformation g(z) causally leads to the evolved function z(T)."
