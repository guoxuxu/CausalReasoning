  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) that describes a rotating vector in the complex plane, influenced by the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We examine the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) to observe the behavior over a period \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformation output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we accurately trace back and determine if an intervention changed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and what the initial \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) was?",
  "Explanation": "The integration process of \\\\( T \\\\) blends the effects of any changes smoothly, making it extremely challenging to differentiate whether there was an intervention, what its nature was, and what the initial frequency conditions were, solely from the transformed output at time T.",
