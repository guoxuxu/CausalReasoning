  "Problem": "Consider a spatial domain in which the temperature distribution is represented by the complex function \\\\(T(z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is time. The initial temperature distribution is given by \\\\(T(z,0) = z^2\\\\). The transformation under consideration is a Laplace transformation applied over time and its inverse applied at a later time \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transformation is applied to \\\\(T(z, 0)\\\\) and allowed to evolve normally, then the inverse transformation is applied at time \\\\(T\\\\), will \\\\(T(z,T)\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(T(z, 0)\\\\) was allowed to evolve until time \\\\(T\\\\) without any transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform to the initial condition and subsequently applying its inverse after some evolution under a given dynamics (not specified but implied) can alter the function in ways that the simple evolution would not achieve. The transformation and its inverse might not perfectly 'cancel out', especially without specific information on the intermediate boundary conditions or temporal dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Laplace transformation to T(z,0) and then its inverse at time T results in the same temperature distribution T(z,T) as if T(z,0) had evolved without any transformations until time T."
