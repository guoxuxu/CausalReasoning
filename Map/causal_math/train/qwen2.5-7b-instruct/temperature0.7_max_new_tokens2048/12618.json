  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space defined over the complex plane and explore the effects of complex function transformations based on the function \\\\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\\\), where \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of this transformation on another function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) defined in the same space that evolves under an integral transformation \\\\(H(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-ixz} dx\\\\).\n\nSuppose that a new function transformation, \\\\(i(z) = e^{kv}z\\\\) where \\\\(v\\\\) is another complex constant, is applied at time t_1 as an intervention on \\\\(h(z)\\\\). Will the output of \\\\(H(z)\\\\) at time T > t_1 rely solely on the characteristics of the initial function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) irrespective of \\\\(w\\\\) or \\\\(v\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(i(z)\\\\) introduces additional complexity into the function space. The final output of \\\\(H(z)\\\\) will be dependent on the initial function but significantly influenced by the multiple transformations (\\\\(e^{iw}z\\\\) and \\\\(e^{kv}z\\\\)). These complex exponential terms effectively modify the frequency domain representation of the function, thereby influencing the end result of the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
