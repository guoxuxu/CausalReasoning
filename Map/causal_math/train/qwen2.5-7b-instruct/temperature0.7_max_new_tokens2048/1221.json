  "Problem": "We consider the Fourier transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\. The system analysis involves altering the input signal using a transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) where a is a constant, and observing the impact on the resulting Fourier transform.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then Fourier transformed without any further intervention, will the form of \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\) at a later time t = T be equivalent to that obtained by directly Fourier transforming \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) without applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) influences the initial function by damping it exponentially, which alters the spectral components of the function. As a result, the Fourier transform will also be modified, showing different characteristics compared to the direct transformation of the unaltered \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(t) to u(t, x) at t = 0 changes its form, which in turn affects the Fourier transform U(t, s) at any later time t = T. Directly Fourier transforming u(t, x) without applying h(t) results in a different U(t, s) at t = T."
