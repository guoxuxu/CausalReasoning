  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf a function modification characterized by a real shift transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is real is applied at some time before applying \\\\(T\\\\), will the characteristic frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) change in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the shift transformation results in the modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}z(t) = e^{at}e^{i\\\\omega t} = e^{(a + i\\\\omega)t} \\\\). When the Laplace transform is applied to this modified function, it yields \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - (a + i\\\\omega)}\\\\). While the location of the pole changes in the complex plane, the imaginary part, indicating the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), remains the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The characteristic frequency ω directly influences the function z(t), which is then modified by a real shift transformation to become g(t). The transformed function g(t) is then subjected to the integral transformation T to produce T[g](s). The characteristic frequency ω does not directly change in the transformed domain but its effect on the function z(t) is modified through the transformation."
