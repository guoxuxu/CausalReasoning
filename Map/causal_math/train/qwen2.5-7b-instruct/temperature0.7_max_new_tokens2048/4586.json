  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x)e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x)\\\\) is a spatial profile and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of oscillation. The function represents a wave-like solution to the wave equation. We apply a Fourier transform in time, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\), to derive frequency domain characteristics and investigate potential changes induced by a spatial transformation \\\\(G(x) = x^2\\\\).\n\nKnowing the transformed frequency characteristics through \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) after applying \\\\(G(x)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at time \\\\(t=0\\\\), can we determine the original spatial profile \\\\(u(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform in the time domain only provides information about the frequency components and does not provide direct information about the spatial profile transformations. Thus, knowing the transformed frequency characteristics does not allow us to infer the original spatial profile \\\\(u(x)\\\\) uniquely.",
