  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) on a bounded domain with initial displacement given by \\\\(u(x,0) = f(x)\\\\) and a Fourier transform applied to the displacement as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x)dx\\\\). We consider how interventions via changes in boundary conditions or initial conditions affect the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nIf after an initial time \\\\(t_0\\\\), boundary conditions are actively modified to a new configuration, will the shape of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) for t > t_0 solely depend on the original initial displacement \\\\(f(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering boundary conditions introduces new dynamics into the system. Given the wave equation's sensitivity to boundary conditions due to its domain definition and the principle of superposition, the waveform \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) post intervention is influenced by these changes. This alteration defines new pathways for wave interference and diffraction, fundamentally altering the evolution from the original state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
