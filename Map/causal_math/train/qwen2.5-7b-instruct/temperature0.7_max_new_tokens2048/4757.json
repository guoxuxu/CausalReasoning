  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Du \\\\), where D is the Laplacian operator. Analyze the influence of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u](k) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier Transform and then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Du \\\\) without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if the initial condition was directly evolved?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform changes the basis from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, which alters the initial conditions and affects how the solution evolves under the differential equation. This results in a solution that is qualitatively different from direct evolution under the Laplacian.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) directly influences the solution u(x, t) through the evolution equation ∂u/∂t = Du. The Fourier Transform of the initial condition Fourier Transform[u(x, 0)](k) also directly influences the solution u(x, t) in the same way."
