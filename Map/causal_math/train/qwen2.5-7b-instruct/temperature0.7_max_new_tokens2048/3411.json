  "Problem": "Analyze the causal inference of a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = U(t)z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is a unitary operator in the complex plane and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system is disturbed by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{A\\tau}z \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant real-valued matrix and \\\\( \\tau \\\\) is time of application.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{B\\sigma}z \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is a second time of application) is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely rely on the original operator \\\\( U(t) \\\\) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions using \\\\( e^{A\\tau}z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{B\\sigma} \\\\) alter the state at their respective times of application, modifying the trajectory and endpoint of the state at time T. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) therefore results from a composite effect of the initial condition altered by A, followed by a modification by B, overlaid with the rotational dynamics of \\\\( U(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(T) for T > t1 is influenced by the operator U(t) and the interventions f(z) and g(z). Specifically, z(t) is initially transformed by U(t), then further transformed by f(z) and g(z) at different times."
