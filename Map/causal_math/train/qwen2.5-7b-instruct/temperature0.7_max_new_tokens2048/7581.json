  "Problem": "Suppose we analyze the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}x + \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}Bu(s) \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. This system reflects the solution to a linear time-invariant dynamic system with input.\n\nIf \\\\( u(t) \\\\) follows a specific predefined path without any intervention throughout the period 0 to T, and \\\\( x \\\\) is given, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) remain constant irrespective of initial conditions set by \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is directly influenced by the initial condition \\\\( x \\\\) as it appears in the solution expression explicitly. Changing \\\\( x \\\\) modifies the particular solution part \\\\( e^{tA}x \\\\), thus affecting \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
