  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt} z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix, is applied at a specific time interval.\n\nCan we accurately determine the type of interventions applied (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) based on knowing the end-state \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) after applying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compounded effects of transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) through their respective matrix exponentials, along with the differential equation evolution, yield a result that does not distinctly reveal the specific transformations applied. Multiple configurations of Q and R with the same or different P could yield similar end-states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the differential equation Pz → dz/dt influences the function z(t), which in turn affects both its real part u(t) and imaginary part v(t). The integral transformation T(z) → T(z)(T) is applied to z(t) over a specific time interval."
