  "Problem": "Examine the implications of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), with D as a constant matrix, upon inclusion of a linear operator mapping \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), where F is another constant matrix applied intermittently.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, following which the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the starting point, thereby altering the trajectory from what would be expected if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) simply evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\). The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) can change the direction and magnitude of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), producing a different outcome at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator h(x) at t=0 followed by evolution under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\) results in x(t) at t=T being equivalent to the direct evolution of x_0 under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\) to t=T."
