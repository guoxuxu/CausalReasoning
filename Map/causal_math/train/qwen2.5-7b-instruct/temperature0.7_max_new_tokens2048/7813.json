  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the system's transfer function in the Laplace domain. Suppose there's a sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\), and we are investigating the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) after processing through the system.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is applied to the system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\) without any alterations, will the frequency content of the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at steady state exactly match the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the input signal?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear and time-invariant, the output in the frequency domain will contain the same frequency components as the input. The system's transfer function, \\\\(H(s)\\\\), provides a frequency-dependent scaling and phase shift but does not introduce new frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An input signal x(t) with frequency ω, when processed through a linear time-invariant system H(s), results in an output y(t) with the same frequency ω at steady state."
