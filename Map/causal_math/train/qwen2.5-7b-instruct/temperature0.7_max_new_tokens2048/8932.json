  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Qz \\\\), where Q is a constant complex matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) over time t, where P is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from varying combinations or sequences of interventions with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), owing to the non-commutativity of exponential matrix transformations. This ambiguity in possible state paths and transformations prevents precise determination of the interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
