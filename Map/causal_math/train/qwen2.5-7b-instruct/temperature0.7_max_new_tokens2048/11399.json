  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We investigate the implications of imposing the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) at time t, where D is also a constant matrix, and analyzing the system's evolution.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a function \\\\( h(z) = Ez \\\\) (where E is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T (T > t_1) depend only on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the transformations induced by both D and E in addition to the natural evolution by C. Each of these matrices could potentially change the direction and rate of growth of the state vectors they are applied to, hence the system's endpoint will depend on the interplay of C, D, and E.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
