  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature \\( T \\) across a rod varies over time and can be described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution as \\( f(T) = T_0 + h \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) where \\( T_0 \\) is the initial uniform temperature, \\( h \\) is the amplitude, and \\( \\\\omega \\) the frequency of the heat variation.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention happens where the temperature distribution is altered by an additional function \\( g(T) = T + q \\\\cos(\\\\phi x) \\) (where \\( q \\) and \\( \\\\phi \\) are constants), will the temperature at a later time \\( t = T \\) only rely on the post-intervention state and not on the initial function \\( f(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\( T(x, T) \\) will be influenced by both the initial function \\( f(T) \\) and the intervention \\( g(T) \\). The effects of \\( f(T) \\) might still be present albeit diminished, and will interplay with the impacts of \\( g(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution f(T) and the intervention g(T) both directly cause changes in the temperature T. The temperature T at a later time depends on both the initial state modified by f(T) and the subsequent intervention g(T)."
