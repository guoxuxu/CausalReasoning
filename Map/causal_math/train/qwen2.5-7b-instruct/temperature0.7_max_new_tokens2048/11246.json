  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of a linear resistor and a capacitor. The charging of the capacitor over time t is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}(V-V_0)\\\\), where V is the voltage across the capacitor, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, and \\\\(V_0\\\\) is the constant input voltage. To analyze the system, we explore the influence of a sinusoidal signal \\\\(A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) superimposed on the input voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\).\n\nAt time t = T, if the measured voltage \\\\(V(T)\\\\) includes fluctuations, can we infer that the sinusoidal signal was definitively added to the input voltage without any other data?",
  "Explanation": "While the presence of fluctuations at \\\\(V(T)\\\\) suggests a possibly variable input, without additional information it's unclear whether these fluctuations are due to a sinusoidal input, external disturbances, or variations in other components like R or C. You cannot definitively trace it back only to the sinusoidal influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A sinusoidal signal influences the voltage V(t) over time, and at time T, the measured voltage V(T) reflects this influence."
