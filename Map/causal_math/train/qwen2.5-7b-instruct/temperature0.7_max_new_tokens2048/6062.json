  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping from the real numbers to the complex plane described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to a Laplace transform, which alters its behavior in the complex domain.\n\nCan we precisely revert to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in time domain after proceeding with its Laplace transform, without having any loss of information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective transformation for this type of exponential function, meaning that it can be uniquely inverted. The original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be precisely recovered using the inverse Laplace transform, retrieving the exact initial form.",
