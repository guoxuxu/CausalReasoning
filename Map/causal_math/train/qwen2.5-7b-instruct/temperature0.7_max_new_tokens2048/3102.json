  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore how the response of the system changes under the effect of external operators such as differentiation or integration over time.\n\nCan the initial complex constant \\\\( C \\\\) be uniquely determined from the known value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the absence of information about operations applied over time?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any external intervention, the transformation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is reversible, allowing for the back-calculation of \\\\( C \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) using the known \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
