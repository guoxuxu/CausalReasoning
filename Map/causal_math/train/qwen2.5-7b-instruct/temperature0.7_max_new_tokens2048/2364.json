  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a time-dependent state in a system. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\( T[z] \\), \\( S[z] \\), or both) at time \\( t_1 \\) solely based on the endpoint \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) may result from various sequences or combinations of transformations. Given the superposition principle in linear systems and the possibility of complex interactions between the phase transformations \\( T[z] \\) and \\( S[z] \\), it is impossible to uniquely identify the nature or sequence of transformations from the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
