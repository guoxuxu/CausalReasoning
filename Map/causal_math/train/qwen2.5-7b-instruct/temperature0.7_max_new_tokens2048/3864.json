  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\\\. Analysis involves exploring Fourier transform of \\\\( u \\\\), denoted as \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), and how the frequency-domain behavior changes under specific transformations.\n\nKnowing only \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\), is it feasible to precisely determine both the scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the shift vector \\\\( v \\\\) that were applied to the original function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the components of \\\\( v \\\\) from \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) is challenging as changes in scale can, to some extent, mimic or obscure the effects of shifting in the frequency domain, leading to potential ambiguities in identifying exact values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\).",
