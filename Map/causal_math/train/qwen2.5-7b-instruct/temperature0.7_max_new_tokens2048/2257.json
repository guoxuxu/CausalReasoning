  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where the output at any time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) is a complex function and A is a constant complex matrix. Consider the effect of an external control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( X(t) \\\\) as \\\\( X_u(t) = X(t) + u(t) \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( X(t) \\\\) changes from a passive state to a new state without external control, will the outcome \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T \\\\) also change in the same manner as \\\\( X(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of \\\\( X(t) \\\\) directly influences output \\\\( Z(T) \\\\), as the integral operation accumulates the effect of the changes in \\\\( X(t) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T. Therefore, any variation in \\\\( X(t) \\\\) directly impacts \\\\( Z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "X(t) → Z(t); u(t) → X_u(t); X(t) → X_u(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changes in X(t) directly cause changes in Z(t); introducing u(t) modifies X(t) to produce X_u(t); thus, changes in X(t) lead to changes in X_u(t), which can affect Z(t) if the integral transformation is sensitive to the input."
