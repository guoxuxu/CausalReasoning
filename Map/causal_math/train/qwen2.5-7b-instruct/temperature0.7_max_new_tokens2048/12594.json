  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and let an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. The study involves analyzing how transformations affect the function and its integration outcomes.\n\nIf during the integration a change is made to the parameter by setting \\\\( s \\\\) to a different complex number \\\\( s' \\\\), will the output of the transform \\\\( T(g) \\\\) then solely depend on the new parameter \\\\( s' \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the parameter to \\\\( s' \\\\) effectively changes the conditions under which the transform is computed. Thus, the output depends entirely on \\\\( s' \\\\) and is independent of the original parameter, reflecting the properties of the transform under the new setting.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
