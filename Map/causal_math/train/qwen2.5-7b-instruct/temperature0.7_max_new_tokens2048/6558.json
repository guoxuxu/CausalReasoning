  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system modeled using a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u\\\\), where L is a differential operator which includes non-linear terms. A Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx}f(x)dx\\\\) is applied to the initial condition to verify the impact on a function propagating through this system.\n\nObserving the function at time t = T, can we work backward to uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the initial application of the Fourier transform, and given the potentially non-linear nature of L, it is impossible to uniquely infer whether the original function had been transformed or not from the observed state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
