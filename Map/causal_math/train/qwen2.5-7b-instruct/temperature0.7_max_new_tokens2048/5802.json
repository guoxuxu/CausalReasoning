  "Problem": "Consider a system subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse being applied under different scenarios. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes an oscillatory behavior \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), can we accurately deduce the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the oscillation without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a function of \\\\( s \\\\) that explicitly contains the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a parameter (namely, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\)). Therefore, we can deduce \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) directly from the form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
