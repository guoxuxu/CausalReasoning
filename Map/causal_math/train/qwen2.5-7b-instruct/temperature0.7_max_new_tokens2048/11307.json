  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix. To examine causal inference, we analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nAssuming an intervention function \\\\( k(z) = Q^{-1}e^{Ft}Qz \\\\) (where \\\\(Q\\\\) is invertible and \\\\(F\\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) exclusively depend on \\\\(M\\\\) without influence from \\\\(D\\\\) or \\\\(F\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) involves new dynamics brought in by \\\\(Q\\\\) and \\\\(F\\\\), which interact with the earlier effects of \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\). Thus, the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is influenced by all matrices involved (\\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(F\\\\)), as each potentially alters the trajectory and final condition of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
