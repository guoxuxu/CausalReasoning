  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the system's transfer function in the Laplace domain. Suppose there's a sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\), and we are investigating the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) after processing through the system.\n\nIf an intervention changes the system's transfer function to \\\\(G(s)\\\\) halfway through the response time, will the steady-state output frequency content still only reflect the input frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transfer function \\\\(G(s)\\\\) midway still preserves the overall linearity and time-invariance on a larger scale. Thus, despite the change in system characteristics (like amplitude scaling and phase shift), the frequency of the output remains unaltered and continues to be \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input x(t) determines the initial output y(t) through the system's transfer function H(s), but if G(s) replaces H(s) halfway through, the steady-state output y(t) will reflect the frequency content of x(t) up to that point, and the new G(s) will process the remaining input."
