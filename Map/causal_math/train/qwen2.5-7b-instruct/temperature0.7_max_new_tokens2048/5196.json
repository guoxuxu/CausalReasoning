  "Problem": "Consider a vector-valued function z(t) defined in a complex domain and governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), where M is a 2x2 matrix. An integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Mt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied. The transformation is modified by a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the outcome \\( T(z)(T) \\), and knowing that an intervention occurred, can we conclusively determine whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), both, or none were applied, considering only \\( T(z)(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex interactions between \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\), combined with the transformations under \\( M \\) and the integration, generate multiple potential trajectories that can yield similar outcomes in \\( T(z)(T) \\). Without additional contextual data such as the specific times of intervention or the exact nature of \\( M \\), multiple scenarios could explain the resultant transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Mz(t) → dz/dt; z(t) → e^(Mt)z(t); e^(Mt)z(t) → T(z)(T); z(t) → e^(iωt)z; e^(iωt)z → f(z)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt) is caused by Mz. z directly influences the transformed z through exponentiation (e^(Mt)z), which in turn is the input for the integral transformation T(z). z also influences f(z) via multiplication with e^(iωt), resulting in the modified function f(z)."
