  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time \\\\( t \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A Laplace transform is then applied yielding \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\).\n\nGiven that we only have the transformed functions \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), can we accurately deduce the original initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) even if we know \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the Laplace transforms \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) provided that the values of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are known, as the inverse Laplace transform would allow computation back to the original conditions, assuming no singularities complicate the inversion.",
