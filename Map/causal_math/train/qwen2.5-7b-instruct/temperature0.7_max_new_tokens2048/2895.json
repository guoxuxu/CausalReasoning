  "Problem": "Examine a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) with an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\), where L represents a linear differential operator. We consider the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where another transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u) \\\\) is used, does the outcome \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still rely on the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and the subsequent intervention \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) both influence the solution at \\\\( T \\\\). Because transformations can modify the functional space and the effect of the operator L, the resultant state depends on both the initial and intervened transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, t); L → ∂u/∂t; u(x, 0) → u(x, t_1); G(u) → u(x, t); Fourier transform → u(k, 0); u(k, 0) → u(x, t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x, 0) influences u(x, t) through the PDE, and the Fourier transform of the initial condition affects u(k, 0), which in turn influences u(x, t). An intervention G(u) at t1 changes u(x, t1) but does not directly affect the outcome u(x, T) for T > t1 unless it alters the initial condition u(x, 0) indirectly."
