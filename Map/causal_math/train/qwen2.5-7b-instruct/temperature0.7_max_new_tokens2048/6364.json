  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop feedback system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Kx + Lu \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) is the control input. We are examining the system's behavior under the integral transformation given by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(K+L)s} ds \\\\cdot x \\\\).\n\nGiven the state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine which transformations (either \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( S(x) \\\\), or both) were applied based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The specific transformations leading to a particular state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) are not uniquely decipherable from the final state alone because both transformations \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and \\\\( S(x) \\\\) might result in overlapping or indistinguishable effects on the system’s trajectory, influenced by the nature of \\\\( K \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u, matrix K, and matrix L directly cause changes in the state vector x. The transformation T(x) then directly causes changes in the state vector x at time T, x(T)."
