  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z is a function representing system states over time. The impact of applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nCan we deduce the exact influence of B on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) given the output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T, without direct observation of the intermediary state after the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) integrates the effect of A over z, making it difficult to directly disentangle the impact B had from observing only the output at T. Without clear visibility of how \\\\( g(z) \\\\) altered z(t) through its integral transformation, the precise influence of B remains indeterminate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
