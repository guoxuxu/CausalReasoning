  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation involving the Fourier integral representation by applying the transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}} e^{as} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nIf the original time function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is altered by a multiplicative constant transformation \\\\( k \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under its natural transform properties without further manipulation, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at any later point only depend on the initial properties given by \\\\( n \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( k \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) scales the entire function, which then influences the Laplace transform, resulting in a scaling of the transform by \\\\( k \\\\) as well, indicated by \\\\( kF(s) = k/s^{n+1} e^{as} \\\\. Therefore, \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depends on \\\\( k \\\\), altering its subsequent characteristics.",
