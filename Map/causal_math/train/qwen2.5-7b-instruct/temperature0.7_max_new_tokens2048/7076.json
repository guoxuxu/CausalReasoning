  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, defined as \\\\( Lf = \\\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\\\. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is used to analyze the system.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) of an intervened function \\\\( g(x) = f(x) + h(x) \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) was applied before adding \\\\( h(x) \\\\), can we distinctly identify the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(x) \\\\) only from \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) details the effects of both \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) under the operator \\\\( L \\\\), disentangling these effects to uniquely recover \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) alone is not straightforward without additional constraints or knowledge about the forms or properties of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear operator L to f(x) influences its Fourier transform \\u0304f(k); the addition of h(x) to f(x) results in g(x), which has a Fourier transform \\u0304g(k); knowing \\u0304g(k) allows us to understand the combined effect of \\u0304f(k) and the transformation due to h(x)."
