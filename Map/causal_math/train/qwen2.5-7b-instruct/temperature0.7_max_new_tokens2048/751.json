  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\\\) mapping the real variable t into the complex plane. We analyze this function under the complex Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf we apply an intervention by way of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a complex exponential \\\\( e^{i kt} \\\\) where k is real, before computing the Fourier transform, will the transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) still reveal the original quadratic and linear terms clearly?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( e^{i kt} \\\\) corresponds to a frequency shift in the Fourier domain. The quadratic and linear terms' signatures in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) become shifted by k units in frequency, mixing with other parts of the transform spectrum and complicating their direct identification.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences its Fourier transform F(ω), and this influence persists even when z(t) is multiplied by e^(ikt). The parameter k affects the Fourier transform F(ω) when z(t) is modified."
