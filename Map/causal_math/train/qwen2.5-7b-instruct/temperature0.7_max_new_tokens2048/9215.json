  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are interested in the effect of an initial Fourier transform on u(x, 0) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, 0) dx\\\\) and how it evolves under the given equation over time t.\n\nIf an external operation defined by \\\\(g(u) = Mu\\\\) where M is a constant matrix is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) where T > t_1 be independent of the Fourier transform applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the operation \\\\(g(u)\\\\), an additional transformation that affects both frequency and spatial domain responses, means that the final processed outputs at T may depend on the form of initial transformations, including the Fourier transform, through interaction with the matrix M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, 0) directly influences u(x, t) through the partial differential equation. The linear operator L(u) directly affects u(x, t). Applying the external operation g(u) at time t_1 directly influences u(x, t) from that point onwards. The Fourier transform of u(x, 0) leads to hat{u}(k, 0), which indirectly affects u(x, t) through the inverse Fourier transform."
