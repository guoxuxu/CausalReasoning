  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) in the complex plane defined by the equation \\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\), where \\( A \\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{iBs}z(s) ds \\), where \\( B \\) is another real constant.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\) achieved by natural evolution under \\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\) from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\), can we infer whether the integral transform was applied during this interval?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( z(T) \\) without knowing the process merely indicates the state at time \\( T \\) without revealing the specific operational transformations like integral transforms, especially since multiple scenarios can lead to the same final state due to the nature of exponential functions.",
