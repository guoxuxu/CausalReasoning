  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the system's change under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely retraced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The possible transformation by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) can fundamentally change the initial state. Without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes non-unique, as different Q values can lead to the same outcome through different initial conditions.",
