  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\. The function undergoes a Fourier transform, yielding the function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) as a result of the Fourier transform of some function, can we determine if the original function was precisely \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function at a specific frequency in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) indicates a sinusoidal component at that frequency, but it does not exclude the presence of additional phases or amplitudes modified in the original time domain function. More information is needed to exactly confirm the form of the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
