  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation governed by Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx \\\\). We study the effect of applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), which is the multiplication of f(x) by x, and its impact over the transformed function.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{g(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\), can we uniquely determine both \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without additional information about whether the multiplication by x was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{g(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) and not whether it resulted directly from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) or its multiplication by x, we cannot ascertain whether the transform represents \\\\( f(x) \\\\) directly or a transformed version of \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\). The form of the original function prior to any transformation remains uncertain.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
