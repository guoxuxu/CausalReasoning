  "Problem": "Combining a Fourier transform with complex functions, consider a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transform given by \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} s(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\). Let the effect of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( s(t) \\\\) be defined as a multiplication by a fixed complex exponential, i.e., \\\\( L[s(t)] = e^{\\\\alpha t} s(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the final observed Fourier transform is \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega - \\\\gamma) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the sequence and values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) used in the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The final shift \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) in the Fourier transform represents the sum of shifts produced by the two exponential operations, but it does not reveal the individual contributions or order of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Different combinations of these complex numbers could result in the same total shift, making it impossible to distinguish the specifics of each intervention solely based on the final observed shift.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator L to s(t) results in a Fourier transform shift to \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega - \\\\gamma) \\\\). The parameter α in L[s(t)] = e^(αt) s(t) directly influences this shift, while β does not affect the observed Fourier transform."
