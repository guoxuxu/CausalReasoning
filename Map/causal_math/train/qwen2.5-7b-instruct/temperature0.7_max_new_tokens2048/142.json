  "Problem": "Consider a complex function governed by \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and the dynamical system is characterized by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\) with constant matrices P and Q. We explore how the system behaves with respect to the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) where M is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be reliably determined without certainty of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions in a non-trivial way due to matrix exponentiation. If the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is unknown, multiple potential original states could correspond to the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially given the non-commutative nature of matrix operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(T) is influenced by the matrices P and Q through the differential equation. The transformation h(z) depends on the matrix M, and applying h(z) to z(T) results in z_0."
