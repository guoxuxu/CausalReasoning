  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over time t, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number. We are interested in the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds\\\\) applied to z.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(h(z) = z^*\\\\) (complex conjugate) is applied as an intervention on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and then the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is reapplied, will the result of \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be simply the sum of the original and conjugate integrals of z?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies z(t) post \\\\(t_1\\\\) into its complex conjugate, fundamentally altering z's trajectory and hence, the concept of simply summing the original and conjugate integrals becomes incorrect. The outcome will be dependent on exactly how z was altered (here, conjugated) post-intervention and how these complex values accumulate over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the integral transformation T(z) to the function z(t) results in T(z). Applying the complex conjugate h(z) to z(t) produces z*, and applying T(z) to z* results in another integral transformation of the conjugate function. The combined effect of T(z) on z and T(z) on z* does not simplify to the sum of their individual integrals for T > t_1."
