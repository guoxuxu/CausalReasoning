  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We analyze the system’s behavior when exposed to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = De^{Nt}z \\\\), where D and N are constant matrices and D is diagonalizable.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention using a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Fe^{Qt}z \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied, does the new final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not the characteristics of D, N, or F and Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the trajectory of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), depending on the matrix F and the exponential term involving Q. Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) would depend on D, N (affecting the state prior to t_1) as well as F and Q, beyond just the original matrix M, affecting the system's entire evolution up to time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
