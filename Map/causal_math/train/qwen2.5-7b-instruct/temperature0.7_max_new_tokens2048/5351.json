  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod along the x-axis is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t}h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a spatial function and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) a decay constant, is applied.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(u) = u + C \\\\cdot q(x,t) \\\\) (where \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) is another spatiotemporal function and C a constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the final temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) depend only on the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) means that the final state of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) now includes effects from \\\\( h(x) \\\\) initially introduced by \\\\( f(u) \\\\), as well as changes due to \\\\( q(x, t) \\\\) and its parameter C. These modifications together dictate the resulting temperature profile, making it dependent on the properties of both initial and intermediate transformations.",
