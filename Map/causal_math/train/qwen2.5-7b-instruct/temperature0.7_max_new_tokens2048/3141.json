  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), resulting in the partial differential equation \\\\( Lu = 0 \\\\). We investigate the system's response to a mapping defined by \\\\( v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)] \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) represents a Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T[u(x,t)] \\\\) is computed at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) evolves under the same operator \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to the situation where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was evolved directly to \\\\( T \\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform as \\\\( T \\\\) changes the function's spectral components. Even under the same linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), the evolution of transformed and original functions can differ significantly due to changes in how different frequency components react to the operator.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x,t) transforms into v(x,t) via Fourier transform T; v(x,t) evolves under operator L to become v(x,T); since L[u(x,t)] = 0, applying L to v(x,t) results in L[v(x,t)] = 0, indicating that transforming u(x,t) first and then evolving it, or evolving u(x,t) directly and then transforming, yield equivalent results at time T."
