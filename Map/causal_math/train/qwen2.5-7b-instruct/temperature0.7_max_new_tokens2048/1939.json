  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The Laplace transform is modified by a multiplying operator \\\\( M(s) \\\\) resulting in a transformed function \\\\( G(s) = M(s)F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied in the transformed domain at a point \\\\( s_0 \\\\) by altering \\\\( M(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s_0 \\\\), will the resulting inverse-transformed time function be the same as altering \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at a specific time corresponding to \\\\( s_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering \\\\( M(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s_0 \\\\) essentially changes the dynamics and effects in the frequency domain, which corresponds to a complex convolution in the time domain that does not directly translate to a simple time point alteration in \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The correspondence between \\\\( s_0 \\\\) and specific changes in \\\\( f(t) \\\\) isn't directly feasible without further information.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Altering M(s) at s_0 changes G(s), which then influences G(t) through the inverse Laplace transform; similarly, altering f(t) at a time corresponding to s_0 directly influences G(t)."
