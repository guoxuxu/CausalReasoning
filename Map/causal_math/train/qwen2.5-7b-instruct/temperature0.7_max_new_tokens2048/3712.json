  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. For analysis, we apply a Fourier transform to change the domain from time to frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\), which converts the time-domain function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) into its frequency-domain counterpart.\n\nCan we precisely determine both the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the external force \\\\(g(t)\\\\), given only the transformed function \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain after the application of external force?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Fourier transform can retrieve a version of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) that includes effects of the external force, without additional data or constraints specifically about \\\\(g(t)\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely decompose and attribute parts of the observed \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) \\\\) fully and correctly to either \\\\(x(t)\\\\) or \\\\(g(t)\\\\). The loss of causal information in the transformation complicates backward reconstruction of both functions distinctly.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformed function F_x(ω) in the frequency domain is derived from the original function x(t) in the time domain through the Fourier transform. The external force g(t) influences the original function x(t) in the time domain, which then affects the transformed function F_x(ω) in the frequency domain."
