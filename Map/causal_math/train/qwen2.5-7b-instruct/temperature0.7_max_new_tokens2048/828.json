  "Problem": "Consider a Riemann surface defined by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\lambda t} \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is a complex constant. The function \\( T(z) = z^k \\) is used as a transformation where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nGiven the observed trajectory \\( z'(T) = (e^{i\\lambda T})^{km} \\), can it be conclusively identified which transformations (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( S(z) \\), or both) were applied at any given time, solely based on \\( z'(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences of applying \\( T(z) \\) and \\( S(z) \\) can result in the same endpoint \\( z'(T) \\), depending on the values of \\( k \\) and \\( m \\). For example, an initial \\( T \\) followed by \\( S \\) can yield the same result as \\( S \\) followed by \\( T \\) due to the properties of exponentiation in complex functions. This ambiguity prevents us from uniquely determining the path of interventions only by observing the endpoint.",
