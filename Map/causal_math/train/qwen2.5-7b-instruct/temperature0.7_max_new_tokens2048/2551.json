  "Problem": "Imagine a system where we want to study heat transfer in a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the material. We analyze the scenario where at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) is initially applied, and then see its evolution or the effects of interventions.\n\nIf an intervention by adding a heat source described by a delta function at a point \\\\( x_0 \\\\) occurs at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be solely dependent on the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the location or intensity of the delta function?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a heat source changes both the location and shape of the temperature distribution. The profile at any later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) not only depends on the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\) but also critically on the location and intensity of the delta function heat source due to the localized increase in temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
