  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function impacts a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\\\), with D being a constant matrix.\n\nDoes the solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\\\) depend nonlinearly on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) if \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is used as the input and no other changes are made to the system?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the differential equation is significantly affected by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) because \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) contributes a complex exponential component that introduces oscillatory behavior into the system dynamics, which interacts nonlinearly with the matrix D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
