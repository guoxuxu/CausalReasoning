  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nCan we uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) if no additional information about applying the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) is given?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is bijective (invertible) under reasonable signal conditions, such as \\\\( z(t) \\\\) being piecewise continuous and satisfying certain integrability conditions. Therefore, even without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( D \\\\), the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The differential operator D affects z(t) to produce z'(t), while the Fourier transform F(z)(ω) is derived from z(t), and vice versa, allowing the recovery of z(t) from F(z)(ω) if D's effect is known."
