  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal frequency. The transformation applied is a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed using the Fourier transform without any modifications, will the resulting spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) exhibit a delta function at the original signal's frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) directly results in a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\omega') \\\\) centered at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This is a fundamental property of the Fourier transform, indicating perfect correspondence between the frequency of original signal and its spectral representation.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
