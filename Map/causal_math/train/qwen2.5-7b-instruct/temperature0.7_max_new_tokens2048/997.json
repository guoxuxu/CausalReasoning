  "Problem": "Consider the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in a flat, thin rod over time \\\\(t\\\\), governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the rod material. We investigate the impact of a change in boundary conditions defined by the step-function \\\\(\\\\phi(x) = T \\\\) (constant temperature) applied at one end of the rod.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\phi(x)\\\\) is applied at \\\\(x = 0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and the system is then allowed to evolve under the given heat equation without any further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at any point \\\\(x\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be influenced by this initial boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(\\\\phi(x)\\\\) as a boundary condition creates a fixed temperature at one end, which modifies the initial and boundary conditions for the heat equation. The evolution of the temperature distribution over time will be influenced by this condition, causing a gradient that propagates through the rod.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
