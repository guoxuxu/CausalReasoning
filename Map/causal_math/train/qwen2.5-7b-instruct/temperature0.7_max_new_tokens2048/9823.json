  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a transformation via a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) on a complex plane where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. Consider the system's change over time if it is described by the flow \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\\\phi}w \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention at time t = t1, will the state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for T > t1 solely depend on the initial \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "After applying the intervention, the trajectory is affected by both the initial transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\). The system's endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\) depends on the compounded effects of \\\\( \\\\theta, \\\\phi \\\\), and \\\\( k \\\\), altering the natural evolution path defined by \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\).",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value of w, the constant k, and the constants θ and φ through their respective transformations, directly influence the state w(T) over time. However, the state w(T) for T > t1 solely depends on the initial k and not on θ or φ."
