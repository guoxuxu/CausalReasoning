  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\), where w is a complex number. The transformation via Laplace transform \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to different function scenarios and the impact on causal inference is analyzed.\n\nGiven the transformed function via Laplace, can we recover the exact form of \\\\( w \\\\) in \\\\( e^{i(wt)} \\\\) without knowing whether any modifications (like shifting in w) occurred prior to transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the exact form of \\\\( w \\\\) purely from the Laplace transform result is uncertain without additional information, as transformations such as scaling or shifting of \\\\( w \\\\) prior to applying the transform affect the parameters in the Laplace domain and could lead to loss of specificity about the original \\\\( w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w directly influences the form of e^(iw) and e^(iwt). The Laplace transform of e^(iw) results in a transformed function that retains information about w, allowing for potential recovery of w's original form if no modifications like shifting occurred."
