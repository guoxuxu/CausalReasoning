  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relationship in a system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + M\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = N z \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) is applied which initially alters the state by converting space-domain information in z into frequency-domain.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( z(x,0) \\\\) be accurately reconstructed at time 0 after observing \\\\( z(x,T) \\\\) at time T, without information about the application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without data on the application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) and how the initial state was transformed (from space to frequency domain), recovering the exact \\\\( z(x,0) \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(x,T) \\\\) is unreliable. The transformation significantly impacts how the state evolves and obscures the direct tracing of initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(x,T) → z(x,0); M → ∂z/∂x; N → ∂z/∂t; z(x,0) → z(x,T); Fourier transform → z(x,0)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state at time T, z(x,T), can be used to infer the initial state z(x,0) through the inverse operation of the Fourier transform. The evolution of z is governed by the matrices M and N, with M affecting the spatial derivative and N affecting the temporal derivative."
