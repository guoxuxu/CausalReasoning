  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The system undergoes analysis under the influence of a transformation, \\\\( g(x) = Cx \\\\), with C being another constant matrix, applied at an arbitrary time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(x) = Ex \\\\) (where E is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), only depend on D and be independent of C and E?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces additional effects to the system dynamics, and thus the terminal state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on the actions of C, E, and D. The state at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is amended by E, which further affects the trajectory alongside D and the initial transformation by C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
