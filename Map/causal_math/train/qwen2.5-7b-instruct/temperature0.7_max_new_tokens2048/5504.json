  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Let's define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nGiven the function at some endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for equivalent effects from different combinations of frequency shifts and rotations, it is impossible to uniquely determine which specific transformation or combinations thereof were applied. This is compounded by the complex interactions between phase shifts that can lead to the same final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The values of u(t) and v(t) determine z(t); the constant ω and the value of t at T determine f(z); knowing z(T) allows inferring the effect of f(z) but not uniquely distinguishing between f(z) and g(z) without additional information."
