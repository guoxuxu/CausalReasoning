  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( t \\\\) is real time parameter. Assess how the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), influences the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and interpret the causal relationships.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a function post-intervention, such as \\\\( F(z')(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine exactly what intervention was applied without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(z')(\\\\omega) \\\\) will show the frequency content altered by the intervention, but it does not provide specific details about what modification was applied (such as the exact nature and timing of change to \\\\( t+1 \\\\)). Multiple interventions could lead to similar transforms, making it ambiguous without more context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform of a function influences its time-domain representation, so F(z')(ω) → z'(t) and F(z)(ω) → z(t). However, given only F(z')(ω), we cannot determine the exact intervention without additional information."
