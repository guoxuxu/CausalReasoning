  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(s) u(s, t) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(s) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nIf a modification \\\\( M(u) = u + v \\\\) is introduced into the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is some function, and then \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied at time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformed output depend exclusively on operator L and not on the properties of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( M(u) \\\\) by adding \\\\( v \\\\) alters the function prior to the transformation by \\\\( T \\\\), hence the output at time T will depend not only on operator L but also on how \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) alter the function's form and behavior through their specific characteristics and interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
