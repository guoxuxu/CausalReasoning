  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain where \\\\(s\\\\) is the complex frequency. The circuit is initially characterized by an impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\). An operational intervention modifies the circuit's impedance to \\\\(Z_2(s) = Z_1(s) + \\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) is another impedance term added.\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies the impedance to \\\\(Z_2(s)\\\\) at a certain time, will the final response of the circuit still be dictated solely by the initial impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the introduction of \\\\(\\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\), which modifies \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) to \\\\(Z_2(s)\\\\), the behavior of the circuit and its response to inputs will now be governed by the new impedance \\\\(Z_2(s)\\\\). This affects how the circuit reacts to the same inputs compared to when only \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) was present, altering the circuit's overall behavior and response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial impedance Z_1(s) directly causes the modified impedance Z_2(s), which then directly causes the final response of the circuit."
