  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) by applying \\\\( f(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. This scenario explores how this transformation, particularly the Laplace transform, affects causal inference in a system's response.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) and this transformed function is used as initial input to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ky \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, will the system response \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) was directly used as input to the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform modifies \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) into its s-domain representation, altering how the system processes the input. The differential equation solution will evolve based on this transformed input, leading to differing outcomes due to the modified input characteristics in the s-domain versus time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform f(u_0) of the initial function u_0 influences the system response y(t) through the differential equation \\\\dot{y} = Ky, with s being a parameter in the transform. The direct input u_0 also influences y(t). The relation u_0 → f(u_0) is redundant."
