  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various sequences and types of transformations due to the exponential form and complex nature of these transformations, allowing for different initial conditions and transformation parameters to yield the same final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) determines the trajectory of z(t) over time, which is influenced by the constant D through the differential equation z'(t) = Dz(t), starting from the initial condition z(0)."
