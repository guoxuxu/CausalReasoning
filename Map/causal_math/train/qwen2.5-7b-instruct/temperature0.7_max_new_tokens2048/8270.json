  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic process described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\(s(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s)(p) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-pt} s(t) dt\\\\), where t is time and p is a complex variable. We explore the effects of modifying this function by a convolution with another function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) defined in the time domain.\n\nBy observing the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s*h)(p)\\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\(s(t)\\\\) without knowing the function \\\\(h(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\(h(t)\\\\), or its transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(h)(p)\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely invert \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s*h)(p)\\\\) to recover \\\\(s(t)\\\\) because the transform could represent multiple possible combinations of \\\\(s(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\).",
