  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the state of the system and c is a constant wave speed. Consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0, and subsequently allowed to evolve under the PDE without any additional manipulation, will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved to t = T directly under the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation and the system's linearity ensures that changes in initial conditions mask through to the system's dynamics unaltered. The wave propagation governed by the PDE retains the integral properties during evolution, implying that the evolution post-Fourier transform at t = 0 would effectively produce the evolved Fourier transform at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x,0) directly influences u(x,t) through the partial differential equation, and applying the Fourier transform F(u) to u(x,0) and then evolving it under the PDE leads to the same u(x,t) as directly evolving u(x,0) under the PDE."
