  "Problem": "Consider a series of random variables \\\\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\\\), each formed by the linear transformation \\\\( Y_i = AX_i \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on these variables and explore the causal inference across these transformations.\n\nGiven the final transformed state \\\\( Z_i \\\\), can we conclusively ascertain whether \\\\( Y_i \\\\) or \\\\( X_i \\\\) were transformed first by the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The final form of \\\\( Z_i \\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations applied to \\\\( X_i \\\\) and \\\\( Y_i \\\\), and the sequence of Fourier transform application on \\\\( X_i \\\\) versus \\\\( Y_i \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( Z_i \\\\) alone. Additionally, the properties of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) could mitigate or amplify certain effects, further obscuring the sequence of events.",
