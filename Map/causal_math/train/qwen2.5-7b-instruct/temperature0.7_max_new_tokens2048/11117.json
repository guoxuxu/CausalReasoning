  "Problem": "We consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions that describe oscillations in a physical system modeled by the second order differential equation \\( \\\\ddot{z} + \\omega^2 z = 0 \\). The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nIf the initial conditions for the system are modified by adding a constant \\( c \\) to \\( u(0) \\) and the system evolves according to the given differential equation, will the resulting function \\( \\tilde{z}(t) = \\tilde{u}(t) + i\\tilde{v}(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) be equivalent to \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) extended by the constant \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in initial conditions affects the entire trajectory of the solution. Specifically, the behavior of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) will differ from their original forms, and this discrepancy will not be a mere translation of the trajectory by \\( c \\) due to the oscillatory nature of the solutions governed by the characteristics of the second order differential system.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition modification (u(0) + c) directly influences u(t), which in turn affects the resulting function z(t) at time t = T. Since the differential equation governing z(t) is linear, the solution at t = T will include the effect of this initial condition change."
