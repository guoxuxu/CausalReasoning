  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\), where w is a complex number. The transformation via Laplace transform \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to different function scenarios and the impact on causal inference is analyzed.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(t) = t^2e^{i(wt)} \\\\) is applied as an intervention before taking the Laplace transform, will the resulting transform dependent primarily on the new function \\\\( g \\\\) and not simply on \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( g(t) = t^2e^{iwt} \\\\) significantly alters the terms involved in the Laplace transform, resulting in a transform that reflects the quadratic term t^2 coupled with the original function. This modification changes both the poles and residues in the transform, making it distinctly dependent on the form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of g(t) depends primarily on g(t) itself rather than just e^(iwt), as g(t) incorporates the additional factor t^2. e^(iwt) influences g(t) and its Laplace transform L[g](s), while e^(iwt) independently transforms to a known form under the Laplace transform."
