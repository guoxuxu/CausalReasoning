  "Problem": "Investigate a system under the effect of a linear transformation expressed through the matrix exponential. The system is defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, and the impact of transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) modifies the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), creating a new initial condition. Since the system's evolution is sensitive to initial conditions and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectory based on the structures of D and M, the state at time T will be different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0 directly causes z(t) through the transformation g(z) = e^(Dt)z, which then evolves under the differential equation ż = Mz to become z(T). However, if z_0 directly evolves under ż = Mz to t = T, it will be equivalent to the state z(T) resulting from the transformation followed by evolution."
