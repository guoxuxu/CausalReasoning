  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nIf an intervention, defined by applying a filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(k)\\\\) in the frequency domain, is used at some t = t_1, will the final state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(T,x)]\\\\) for T > t_1 still mimic the unfiltered system's behavior?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new element, the filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(k)\\\\), which modifies the frequency components of the solution. This alteration affects the subsequent evolution, making the state at time T dependent on the nature of the filter applied, thus diverging from the trajectory of the original unfiltered system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in time (t) causes changes in the state variable (u); the constant (a) directly influences the state variable (u); spatial position (x) influences the state variable (u); the Fourier transform (F[u(t, x)]) converts the state variable from spatial to frequency domain; applying a filter (G) in the frequency domain modifies the Fourier transform (F[u(t, x)]), which in turn affects the final state (F[u(T, x)]) for T > t_1."
