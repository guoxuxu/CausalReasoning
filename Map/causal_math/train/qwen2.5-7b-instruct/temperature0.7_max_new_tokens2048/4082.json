  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent electric field \\\\( E(t) \\\\) in a region, defined by \\\\( E(t) = E_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( E_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants. The response of a charged particle to this field is given by the differential equation \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} = qE(t) \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is the mass and \\\\( q \\\\) is the charge of the particle. We examine the impact of a damping force \\\\( -b\\\\dot{x} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a damping coefficient, introduced at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can it be completely determined whether the damping force was applied, ignoring error and external factors?",
  "Explanation": "The position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone does not provide sufficient information to ascertain whether a damping force was applied, as the phase and amplitude influenced by initial conditions and the frequency of the driving force could mimic damped or undamped scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time-dependent electric field E(t) and the properties of the particle (mass m, charge q) directly cause the position x(t) over time. The damping coefficient b and the application time t0 introduce additional influence on x(t). The position x(T) at time T reflects the combined effect of these variables."
