  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The complex function transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) can we deduce the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) being applied, the presence of the exponential term \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) affects the inversion process, making it ambiguous to recover the original \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) precisely due to the non-trivial time-dependent factor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
