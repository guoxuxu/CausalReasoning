  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal x(t) is subjected to a linear transformation using an operator L. The transformed signal is represented as y(t) = L{x(t)}. Further, an integral transform T defined by T{y(t)} = ∫y(t)e^{-st} dt is applied to y(t).\n\nGiven the transformed signal result from T{y(t)}, can we accurately determine x(t) without knowing the operator L that was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of x(t) from T{y(t)} depends critically on knowing L, as the linear transformation L can modify x(t) in various ways that are irreversible or indistinguishable once the integral transform T has been applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) is transformed into y(t) via a linear operator L, and then T{y(t)} is obtained by applying an integral transform to y(t). Knowing T{y(t)} alone is insufficient to accurately determine x(t) without knowledge of L."
