  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Question the impact of applying a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^k \\\\) at different times, where k is a positive integer.\n\nConsidering the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the end of the period, is it possible to conclusively identify which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied solely based on the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be created by various paths involving the earlier transformations either singularly or in combination due to the exponential and polynomial characteristics of the transformations used. This results in multiple potential causal sequences leading to the same effect, hence barring unique traceability of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 and time t directly cause the state z(t); time t also directly causes the application of the transformation h(z) with parameter k; the state z(T) at the end of the period directly influences the ability to identify which transformations were applied."
