  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of a fluid flow which density ρ at a point (x, y, z) in space varies over time. The flow is defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is the velocity field. An intervention is modeled by a transformation \\\\( g(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\exp(-kt) \\\\), with k being a positive constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\exp(3kt) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the properties of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) and not on k?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( h(\\\\rho) \\\\) further complicates the evolution by introducing an additional exponential scaling factor, making the final state \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\) dependent not only on the velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) but also heavily influenced by both the first and the second transformations involving k.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The density ρ changes over time due to the velocity field v and is transformed by g(ρ) and h(ρ). The endpoint ρ(T) for T > t_1 depends on the initial conditions and the effects of both g(ρ) and h(ρ), which include the properties of v and k."
