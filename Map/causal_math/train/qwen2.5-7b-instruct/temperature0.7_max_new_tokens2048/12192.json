  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) is the temperature distribution over a domain. We investigate the effect of introducing a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) applied from time t = 0, described mathematically as \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\).\n\nIf the source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution at time T, \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\), be different from the scenario where no source term was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) adds energy to the system and alters its initial and boundary conditions. The additional term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) in the heat equation introduces a new component to the temperature distribution throughout the evolution, making \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) fundamentally different from the case without \\\\( S(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The source term S(x) directly influences the temperature distribution u(T,x) through the differential equation dynamics, where changes in u_t lead to changes in u, and the Laplacian Δu further modifies u."
