  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is used to analyze its frequency components.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), can one deduce if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was originally incremented by a constant at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Information about specific time-domain modifications like adding a constant is generally lost in the frequency domain, especially at frequencies other than zero. The phase and amplitude at \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) could result from various time-domain alterations, making it impossible to specifically confirm the addition of a constant to \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "x(t) → z(t); y(t) → z(t); z(t) → \\hat{z}(\\omega); increment of x(t) at t=0 → change in z(t); change in z(t) → change in \\hat{z}(\\omega)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increment of x(t) at t=0 leads to a change in z(t), which then influences the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\)."
