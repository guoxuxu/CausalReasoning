  "Problem": "We explore the impact of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Here, \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and we define it as \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. The differential operator serves as an integral transformation of the function, possibly altering its domain and behavior.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(x) = e^x \\\\) is first transformed by \\\\( L \\\\), and later an intervention modifies \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\) again, will the final outcome depend only on the last applied function \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of the system after multiple transformations and interventions (transforming \\\\( e^x \\\\) followed by transforming \\\\( x^2 \\\\)) depends on both the transformations and the functions involved due to the compounding effect of the two different transformations, thus not solely on the final function applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the differential operator L to a function transforms it into an outcome, so L(g(x)) → outcome and L(h(x)) → outcome depend on the functions g(x) and h(x) respectively."
