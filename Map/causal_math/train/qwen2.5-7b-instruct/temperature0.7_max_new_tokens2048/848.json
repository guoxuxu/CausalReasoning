  "Problem": "Consider a function space governed by the Laplace transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\). Analyze the impact of applying a differentiation operator, denoted as \\( D \\), where \\( D\\{ f(t) \\} = f'(t) \\), to functions within this space.\n\nGiven \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{ D\\{ f(t) \\} \\} \\), can we precisely determine the interventions used (whether \\( D \\), multiplication by \\( e^{at} \\), or both), solely by observing the transform at s?",
  "Explanation": "Deducing the specific interventions from the Laplace transform of the derivative includes inherent ambiguities. Multiple operations (differentiation, multiplication by exponential functions) affect the transform in overlapping ways, making it difficult to uncouple the individual contributions uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the differentiation operator D to a function f(t) results in its derivative f'(t), and the Laplace transform of the differentiated function L{ D{ f(t) } } is related to the original transform through the property sF(s) - f(0)."
