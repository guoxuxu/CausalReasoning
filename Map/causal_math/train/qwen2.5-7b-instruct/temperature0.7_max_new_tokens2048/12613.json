  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by the convolution integral \\\\( z(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input function, and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response of the system represented using the Laplace transform as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). We investigate the changes when applying a scaling transformation \\\\( f(x) = kx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant scalar.\n\nIf it is observed that the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is scaled by a factor \\\\( k \\\\) at time $t$, can we conclusively determine that the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was scaled by \\\\( k \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity and time-invariance of the system, a scaling observed in the output directly implies the same scaling in the input, assuming no other transformations occur within the system's dynamics.",
