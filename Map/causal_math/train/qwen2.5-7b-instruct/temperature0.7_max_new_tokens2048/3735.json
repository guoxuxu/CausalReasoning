  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( y(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = My + Nu \\), with \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) as constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) as the control input. An operator \\( T(y) = e^{Ky} \\) is introduced, where \\( K \\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( T(y) \\) is initially applied and at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a control \\( u(t) \\) is modified, will the resulting \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) solely depend on \\( M \\) and not \\( K \\) or \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of \\( y(t) \\) will be influenced by the initial application of \\( T(y) \\) and any modifications in \\( u(t) \\), which affects \\( y(t) \\) through \\( N \\). Both \\( N \\) and \\( K \\) influence the system’s response alongside \\( M \\), affecting \\( y(T) \\) in a compositional manner.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The output y(t) is directly influenced by the control input u(t), the matrix M, and the matrix N. The operator T(y) = e^(Ky) does not directly affect y(t) after the modification of u(t) at time t_1."
