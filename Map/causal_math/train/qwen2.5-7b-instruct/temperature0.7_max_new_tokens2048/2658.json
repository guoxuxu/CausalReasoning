  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Lz + \\eta(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) represents the influence of noise, which could be stochastic in nature. We explore the effect of introducing a control operation given by \\\\(g(z) = Dz\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nGiven the stochastic system state at time T, can one definitively trace it back to an initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing if \\\\(D\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic element \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) introduces uncertainty and variability in the trajectories, which makes it impossible to determine unequivocally the initial state or the presence of initial intervention by \\\\(D\\\\) solely from the state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
