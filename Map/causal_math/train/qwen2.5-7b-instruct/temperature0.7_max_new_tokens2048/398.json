  "Problem": "Investigate the influence of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on the function space \\\\( u(x) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is characterized by a differential equation \\\\( L[u] = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\) with a boundary condition \\\\( u(0) = u(1) = 0 \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant scalar. We examine how transformations including \\\\( u(x) = v(x)e^{\\\\alpha x} \\\\) with a constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) affect the function space.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( v(x) \\\\) at x = 1, can we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( v(x) = u(x)e^{-\\\\alpha x} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation, one cannot unequivocally revert \\\\( v(x) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = 0, as the transformation \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha x} \\\\) may have altered the function in a way that is not directly traceable from the observed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator L[u] determines the function u(x), and applying the transformation u(x) = v(x)e^(αx) yields v(x), which can be used to recover u(x) given the boundary conditions u(0) = 0 and u(1) = 0. The constant c characterizes L[u], and α influences the form of v(x)."
