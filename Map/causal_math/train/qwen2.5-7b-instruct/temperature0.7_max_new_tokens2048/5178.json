  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), where \\( t \\) is time. We evaluate the integration of this function transformed by a differential operator \\( D \\) such that \\( Dz = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}z \\), for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nGiven the outcome \\( Dz(t) \\) for \\( n = 2 \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we infer the original function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Having the second derivative \\( Dz(t) = -e^{it} \\) does not provide enough information to completely reconstruct the original function \\( z(t) \\) without initial state information, as multiple functions could exhibit the same second derivative over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
