  "Problem": "Let's explore a system involving a stochastic variable X following the distribution \\(f_X(x) = e^{-x}\\) for \\(x > 0\\) and the integral transform \\(T[X] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx} f_X(x) dx\\). We're interested in evaluating the implications of changing the parameter \\(t\\) within the transform, specifically for \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nIf the parameter \\(t\\) is altered from \\(t = 1\\) to \\(t = 2\\) at the outset and evolves with the transform \\(T[X]\\) without further modification, does this change the result of \\(T[X]\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\(t\\) affects the transform directly as \\(T[X]\\) is highly sensitive to the value of \\(t\\). Altering \\(t\\) changes the integrand and thus the resultant value of the integral, modifying the output of the transform over any span of time.",
