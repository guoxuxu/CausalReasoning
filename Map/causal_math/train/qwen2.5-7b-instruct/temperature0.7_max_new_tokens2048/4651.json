  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) representing a controlled input.\n\nIf an intervention modifies both A and B matrices to A' and B' at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) solely depend on the new system parameters A' and B' without any contribution from A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The output up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depends on A and B, and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) on A' and B'. The final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is influenced by the system's history prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\), thus including effects from both the original and modified parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → y(t); B → y(t); A' → y(t) for t >= t1; B' → y(t) for t >= t1",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A and B directly cause y(t) for t < t1; A' and B' directly cause y(t) for t ≥ t1, thus y(T) depends on A and B up to t1, and A' and B' thereafter."
