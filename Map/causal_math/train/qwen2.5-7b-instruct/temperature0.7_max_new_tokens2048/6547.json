  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator to produce an output \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf the kernel is altered at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to a new kernel \\\\( k'(t, s) \\\\), will the output at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be independent of previous kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output at any time point depends on both the input signal and the kernel applied up to that time. Changes to the kernel at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) do not negate the effects of the original kernel on the signal processed before \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the resulting output will reflect the cumulative effect of both kernels applied over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "k(t, s) → y(t); k'(t, s) → y(t); t_1 → k(t, s); t_1 → k'(t, s)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel k(t, s) directly influences the output y(t) at any time t. Changing the kernel to k'(t, s) at time t_1 directly influences the output y(t) for t > t_1. The change in kernel at t_1 does not depend on the previous kernel k(t, s)."
