  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex system modeled by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. The transformation considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the observed value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), or the specifics of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), there might be multiple possible initial values corresponding to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation modifies both magnitude and phase, which obscures the evaluation of the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
