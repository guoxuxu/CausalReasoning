  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( T \\) represented by a constant matrix applied to vector space \\( V \\). This operator is part of the integral transformation \\( y(x) = \\int_{a}^{b} T f(\\xi) K(x,\\xi) \\, d\\xi \\), where \\( K(x,\\xi) \\) is the kernel function for the transformation.\n\nKnowing the final output \\( y(x) \\) after full transformation and intervention, can we determine exactly whether the operator \\( S \\) was applied, solely based on analyzing \\( y(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention, especially the application of \\( S \\), just from the final output \\( y(x) \\) is not feasible, as multiple configurations of \\( T \\), \\( K \\), and alterations like \\( S \\) could yield similar or identical results. The ambiguity involved in the transformation process prevents pinpointing the exact sequence and type of interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
