  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that governs temperature distribution over a rod, described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant. Assume that \\\\( u(x,0) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) as the initial condition. We observe the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant, over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a correction \\\\( g(u) = u - e^{bt} \\\\) (where b is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the heat diffusion coefficient k and not on a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) inserts another alteration into the system, directly affecting the temperature distribution and thus the solution. The resulting state at time T depends on how both exponential terms \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) interact with the diffusion process.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) and the heat diffusion coefficient k determine u(x,t) over time. At time t_1, the intervention g(u) is applied based on constants a and b, which then influences the final state u(x,T). The final state u(x,T) for T > t_1 depends on k, the initial condition, and the interventions g(u) but not solely on a or b."
