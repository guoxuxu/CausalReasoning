  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = pz + q \\\\), where p and q are complex constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) (where k is a positive integer) and its influence on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = pz + q \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the same equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by raising \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to the power k, changing the foundational state from which the system evolves. This alteration generally leads to a different trajectory and final state for \\\\( z(T) \\\\), influenced by the dynamics introduced by the exponential growth or decay designated by the powers of z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) = z^k applied to z_0 at t=0 results in z^k, which then evolves over time according to dz/dt = pz + q to become z(t), leading to z(T) after time T."
