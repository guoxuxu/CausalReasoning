  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate what happens when a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied on the initial temperature distribution, and later an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is used.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is mapped by a Fourier transform and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation, will the temperature distribution at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be exactly representable by applying the inverse Fourier transform to the evolved transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition, followed by an analytical solution of the transformed heat equation and an inverse Fourier transform, will correctly reproduce the time-evolved temperature distribution. The linear nature of both the Fourier transform and the heat equation preserves the transformation sequence.",
