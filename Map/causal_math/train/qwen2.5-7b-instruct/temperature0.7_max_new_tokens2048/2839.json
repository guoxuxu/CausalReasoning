  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nIf at a certain point someone modifies the original function by an additional transformation \\\\( G(x) = x(t) + \\\\alpha sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants, will the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for an arbitrary \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) still reflect only the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( G(x) \\\\) adds a new component to the function, which will also be reflected in the Fourier transform spectrum. The resulting \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) will contain additional frequencies and amplitudes corresponding to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation G(x) introduces an additional sinusoidal component α sin(β t) to the original signal x(t), which then affects the Fourier transform X(ω) such that it no longer reflects only the original function x_0(t)."
