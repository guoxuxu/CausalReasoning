  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Rt} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to reverse-engineer exactly to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transforming effect of \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\) could significantly alter the trajectory, making it indistinguishable from others that started from different initial conditions.",
