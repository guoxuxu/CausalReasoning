  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t, z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f \\\\) involves a mixture of linear algebraic operations and integral transformations. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} z dt \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under the system's rules without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the system's rules?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the integral path of \\\\( z \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T, effectively altering its evolution. This action changes the initial trajectory by integrating over a modified function, thus the state at time T changes depending on the specific properties of A in relation to the system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g to z_0 at t=0 results in a different z than directly evolving z_0 to t=T under the system's rules because g involves an integral over time from 0 to T, whereas direct evolution follows the system's differential equation from t=0 to t=T."
