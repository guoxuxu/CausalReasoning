  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamic system modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant square matrix. The impact on the system's trajectory of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also constant matrices, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\\\). This transformation, due to the involvement of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and potentially nontrivial C, alters the trajectory in the phase space, resulting in a different state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) with constants C and D, starting from z_0 at time t, results in z(t) which evolves under the differential equation defined by M. Without further intervention, z(t) after time T under this transformation is equivalent to evolving z_0 directly to time T under the same differential equation."
