  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The function undergoes a Laplace transform and subsequent inverse Laplace transform, resulting in a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the function's status at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the modulation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) was applied, only by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing A?",
  "Explanation": "As different values of B could yield similar transformations in the function, particularly over varying time scales or if B has certain symmetrical properties with respect to A, it's not feasible to precisely pinpoint the modulation using only the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The interaction between A and B complicates direct inference of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) depends on A, and if e^(Bt) was applied, it would modulate z(t) to become z(t) * e^(Bt), but determining precise application of e^(Bt) solely from z(T) requires additional information."
