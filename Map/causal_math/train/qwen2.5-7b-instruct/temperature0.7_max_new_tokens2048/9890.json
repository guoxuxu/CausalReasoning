  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) on this function.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\}(s) \\\\) at a point \\\\( s \\\\), can we exactly determine the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) if we know the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the Laplace transform as it incorporates \\\\( z(0) \\\\) directly in its formulation (\\\\( s\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} - i\\\\omega\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = z(0) \\\\)). By resolving for \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\), one can effectively retrieve \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
