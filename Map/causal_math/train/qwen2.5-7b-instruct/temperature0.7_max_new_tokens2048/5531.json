  "Problem": "A complex function is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = cz + d \\\\) over time t, where c and d are complex constants.\n\nIf at a predefined time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( M(z) = az + b \\\\) (where a and b are complex constants) is applied, will the outcome \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for any t > t_1 only depend on the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not the coefficients c, d, a, or b?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\( M(z) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the outcome further and makes the final state dependent not only on the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but also complex interplay among the coefficients c, d, a, and b. These transformations change both amplitude and phase, influencing the final outputs in compound.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) for any t > t_1 depends on the original frequency ω through the transformation L(z) and is further modified by the transformation M(z) with coefficients a and b, but not directly by the coefficients c and d of the initial transformation L(z)."
