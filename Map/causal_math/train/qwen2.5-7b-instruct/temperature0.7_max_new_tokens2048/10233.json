  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore how different transformations influence this function, specifically transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different times.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and allow the system to evolve naturally, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if it were evolved without applying \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( T_1(e^{it}) = e^{e^{it}} \\\\) substantially modifies the growth and oscillatory behavior of the function, the path and final state at time T are altered compared to the natural evolution of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformation T1(z) at time t=0 changes z(t) which then evolves to z(T), whereas if T1(z) is not applied, z(t) evolves directly to z(T) without change."
