  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\), where K is a matrix. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\), where L is a diagonal matrix and S is an invertible matrix, over the time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and subsequently evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T be identical to what would result if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) means that the starting point of the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\) is fundamentally altered by the application of \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Lt}S \\\\), which typically reshapes the trajectory based on L and S in relation to K, therefore leading to a different result at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(x) to x_0 at t=0 and evolving it under \\(\\dot{x} = Kx\\) will result in the same x(T) as directly evolving x_0 under \\(\\dot{x} = Kx\\) to t=T."
