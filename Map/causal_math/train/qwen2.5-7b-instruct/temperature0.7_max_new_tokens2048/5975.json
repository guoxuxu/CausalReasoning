  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + \\\\sin(t)\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. An integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M(t-s)}z(s)ds \\\\) is used to investigate causal relationships.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( U[z](t) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{N(t-s)}z(s)ds \\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, solely depend on M and not on N?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( U \\\\) brings additional dynamics into the system, affecting the future state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Since \\\\( U \\\\) incorporates another matrix exponential involving N, the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will depend on both the effects of M and N, and how they interact with the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint z(T) is influenced by both T[z](t) and U[z](t), which in turn are influenced by M and N respectively."
