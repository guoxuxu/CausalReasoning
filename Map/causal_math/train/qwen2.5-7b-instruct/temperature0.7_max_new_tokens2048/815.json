  "Problem": "We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), on its related differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nAssuming that at time t = 0 some specific filtering process defined by a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied and later at t = t1 an additional function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) which modulates the signal, will the Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) be affected solely by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\) and retain traces of the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the additional transformations \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) introduces new elements into the system, influencing the final state \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\). These interventions alter the frequency content and distribution, making the outcome depend not only on the original differential equation but also on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of a Fourier transform to a time-dependent signal x(t) results in X(ω). The signal x(t) is influenced by the initial filtering process h(t) and the modulation function g(t) at time t1. The transformed signal X(ω) evolves into X(ω, T) over time. The differential equation d/dt x(t) + ax(t) = 0 shapes the behavior of x(t) but does not directly affect X(ω, T) unless the effects of h(t) and g(t) are included."
