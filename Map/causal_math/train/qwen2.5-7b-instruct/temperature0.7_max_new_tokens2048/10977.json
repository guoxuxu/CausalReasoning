  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are functions of time, t, subject to a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) with constant matrices A and B. The function z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the resultant function is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Az_0 + B \\\\). Thus, the trajectory of z will evolve from this new initial condition under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), leading to a different state at any time T compared to direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving under Cz is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under Cz."
