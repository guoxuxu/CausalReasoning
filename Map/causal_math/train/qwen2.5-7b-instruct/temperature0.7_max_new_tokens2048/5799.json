  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf partway through the evolution at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is suddenly doubled, will the trajectory after time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be identical to what it would have been without this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the frequency at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the angular velocity of rotation. Therefore, the trajectory after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will deviate from its original path, inducing a faster rotation around the complex origin thereafter.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences the form of z(t) and its Laplace transform ℒ{z(t)}. At time t1, doubling ω changes z(t) and consequently its Laplace transform, making the trajectory after t1 different from what it would have been without the intervention."
