  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature change over time is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\), where k is a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) applied at different times.\n\nGiven the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we conclusively determine the initial temperature T_0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation has been applied, there could be multiple initial conditions (i.e., \\\\( T_0 \\\\) or the square root of \\\\( T_0 \\\\) if it were squared initially) that lead to the same observed temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\). The lack of information about the application of the transformation introduces ambiguity in deducing \\\\( T_0 \\\\).",
