  "Problem": "Consider the role of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the position of a particle in a two-dimensional space. This function is subjected to a transformation using a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We study the impact of this transformation and potential interventions on the system.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of the initial function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any initial time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) after observing its Fourier transform \\\\(F(z)(\\\\omega)\\\\) without knowing additional properties of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier inversion theorem allows us to reconstruct the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from its Fourier transform under the condition that \\\\(z(t)\\\\) satisfies certain properties such as integrability. Therefore, we can deduce the exact initial state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(z)(\\\\omega)\\\\), provided no additional transformations or losses in information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
