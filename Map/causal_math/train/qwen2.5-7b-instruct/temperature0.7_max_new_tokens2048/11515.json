  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are fixed matrices. Analyze how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) as another constant matrix, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\) when applied at different stages.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the initial matrix \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces further modifications to the system’s evolution, making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the original transformation \\\\( M \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( N \\\\) as well as \\\\( P \\\\). The endpoint’s state will be influenced by how these matrices interact over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "P and Q determine the rate of change of z(t), M transforms z(t) through h(z), and N transforms z(t) through k(z). The endpoint z(T) depends on P and Q but not on M or N after applying k(z) at t1."
