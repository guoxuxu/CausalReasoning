  "Problem": "Investigate the system described by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant. We apply transformations using the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) and study the effect at time \\( t \\).\n\nKnowing the outcome \\( z(T) \\), is it possible to precisely determine if transformations \\( F(s) \\) and/or \\( G(s) \\) were applied, just from \\( z(T) \\), especially when no details of \\( F(s) \\) or \\( G(s) \\) are provided?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the applied transformations from \\( z(T) \\) alone is infeasible without additional constraints or information. Both \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) could individually or collaboratively lead to similar outputs due to the potential overlapping properties in the Laplace transform functions, making it impossible to deduce the interventions used uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the function z(t) at time T causally influences z(T); the constant a directly causes the form of z(t); time T directly causes the value of z(T)."
