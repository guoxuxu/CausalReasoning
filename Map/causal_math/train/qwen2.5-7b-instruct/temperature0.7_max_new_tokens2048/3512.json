  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) at any given time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), with a control input \\\\( u \\\\). Here, A is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics and B is the control matrix. An operator applies a transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\), where C is another constant matrix determining a specific kind of state transformation.\n\nKnowing the final system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we accurately reverse-engineer and determine whether transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) and specific control interventions were applied throughout the timeline given only the matrices A, B, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap of exponential transformations and control influences involving matrices A, B, C, and D makes it challenging to uniquely identify both the transformations and the specific control actions used throughout the evolution of the system, especially if not all parameters (like \\\\( v(t) \\\\)) are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The system dynamics matrix A directly influences the rate of change of the state vector x, the control input B also directly influences the rate of change of the state vector x, the transformation matrix C directly influences the operator T(t), and the initial state vector x directly influences the operator T(t)."
