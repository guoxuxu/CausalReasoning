  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state of a system is described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and u is a control input. Assume the control input is transformed according to \\\\( g(u) = K e^{Lt} u \\\\), where K and L are also constant matrices.\n\nIf the control input \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is implemented at t = 0 and the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\) without further modifications, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T depend only on the matrices C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) = K e^{Lt} u \\\\) modifies the control input, thereby changing the evolution of the state. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) not only depends on C and D but also on how K and L interact with these matrices through the control input over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u, transformed by g(u) → x, and the system dynamics described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\) imply that the state x at time T depends on both the matrices C and D through the transformation g(u) and the initial control input u."
