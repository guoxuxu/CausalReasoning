  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapped to a vector field by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is studied on the plane transformed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer.\n\nConsidering the final state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\), is it possible to ascertain precisely which interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the outcome \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiple transformations involved and complex interactions due to powers and exponentials mean the end state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) could result from various combinations or sequences of interventions. The potential for different causal paths leading to the same output state makes precise back-calculation of interventions unclear.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
