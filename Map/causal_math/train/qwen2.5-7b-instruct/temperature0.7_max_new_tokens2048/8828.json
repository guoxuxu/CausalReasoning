  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state in the complex plane. We assess the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is observed, can we determine exactly which transformations \\(f(z)\\) and/or \\\\(g(z)\\) were applied, based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to distinguish whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), either, or both were applied, due to the potential equivalence in their effects over one cycle in complex exponential rotation, and the general non-linearities introduced by complex exponentiation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0, the angular frequency ω_0, and the constant k each contribute to determining z(T) through the transformations defined by the functions."
