  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation \\\\(L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s)\\) of a function f(t). Assume that the function is multiplied by a time-dependent factor, resulting in a new function \\\\(g(t) = t^n f(t)\\\\) where n is a non-negative integer. Analyze the transformations under various conditions.\n\nCan we determine the specific value of n and whether the exponential decay factor \\\\(e^{-at}\\\\) was applied, solely based on the transformed function in the Laplace domain?",
  "Explanation": "The nonlinear effects of t^n and the interaction with the exponential decay factor create a complex transformation in the Laplace domain, which cannot uniquely determine the specifics of n or the presence of \\\\(e^{-at}\\\\) without additional information. Different combinations could potentially result in similar or indistinguishable transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
