  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the set of complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\), and let's consider an integral transformation of this function, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result of the processed function after applications of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine precisely what functions were used and their parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform does not retain all information about the sequence or types of operations that led to it because of overlapping effects from powers and shifts. Multiple different sequences of operations can lead to indistinguishable results in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
