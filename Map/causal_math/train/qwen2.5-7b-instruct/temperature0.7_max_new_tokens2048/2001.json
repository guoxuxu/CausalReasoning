  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We investigate the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\( M \\), which acts on the complex plane by the function \\( f(z) = Mz \\).\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) and then the function \\( g(z) \\) is computed without further interventions, will the outcome at \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) be the same as computing \\( g(z_0) \\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the linear transformation \\( f(z) = Mz \\) modifies the argument of the exponential function in \\( g(z) \\). Since the matrix \\( M \\) can alter both magnitude and phase of \\( z_0 \\), \\( g(f(z_0)) = e^{iMz_0} \\) typically differs from \\( g(z_0) = e^{iz_0} \\), due to the changes in the complex exponential's frequency and growth rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
