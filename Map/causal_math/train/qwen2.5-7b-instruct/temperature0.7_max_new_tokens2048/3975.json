  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(t\\\\) is real time variable. We study the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{is}ds * z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at a precise moment \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), an action such as multiplying by a new function \\\\(h(z) = z + e^{it_1}\\\\) is introduced, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\(e^{it}\\\\) and not on the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or the intervention \\\\(h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint would depend on both the initial transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) and the intervention \\\\(h(z)\\\\). Each contributes distinctly to changing the path and the final form of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), making the outcome depend collectively on these transformations.",
