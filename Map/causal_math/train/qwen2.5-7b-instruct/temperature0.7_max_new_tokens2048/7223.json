  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. The influence of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z dt \\\\) is considered, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{Et}z dt \\\\) (where E is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by D due to initial transformation and also by E for the intervention, in addition to the natural matrix exponential growth due to C. The new integral introduces an additional modification to the trajectory, indicating that all matrices D, E, and C influence the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
