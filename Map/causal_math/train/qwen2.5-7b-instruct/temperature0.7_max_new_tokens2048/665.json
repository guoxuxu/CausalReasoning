  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system where the evolution of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix. We are interested in how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) over time, where D is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will the position of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was just evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) modifies the initial state of the system. Depending on the properties and the relative structure of D compared to C, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can diverge substantially from that of the untransformed initial condition, resulting in a different position at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under dz/dt = Cz for time T results in the same position of z(t) as evolving z_0 directly under dz/dt = Cz for time T, given that both processes are influenced by C and start from the same initial condition."
