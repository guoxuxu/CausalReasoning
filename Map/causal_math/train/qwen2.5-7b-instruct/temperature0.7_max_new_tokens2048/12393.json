  "Problem": "Assume a system governs the motion of a particle along a path on the complex plane, given by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial position and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant complex frequency. We consider transformations of the path using a mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling parameter.\n\nIs it possible to infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the position of the particle at time t = T, without knowing whether or not the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is infeasible since \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) could have altered the initial magnitude, making backward calculation to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\) ambiguous due to the missing information about scaling.",
