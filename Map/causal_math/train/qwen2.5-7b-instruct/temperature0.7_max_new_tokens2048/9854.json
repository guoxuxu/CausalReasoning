  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) represents a signal in the complex plane, evolving over time according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with P being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), applied at time t = 0.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) for some s over time, can we unequivocally deduce the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the properties of matrix P without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) provides a transformed view of the dynamics encapsulated by \\\\( P \\\\), but recovering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and specific attributes of \\\\( P \\\\) solely from the transform is generally underdetermined without further conditions or data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The properties of matrix P directly cause changes in z(t), which then influences the Laplace transform L(z)(s); the value of L(z)(s) at s can be used to infer z_0, but requires solving the transformed equation."
