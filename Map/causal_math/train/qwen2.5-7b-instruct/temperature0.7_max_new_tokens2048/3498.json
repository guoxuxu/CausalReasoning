  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where c is a constant. Investigate the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{-sx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied at t = 0.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\), can we recover the exact function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) that existed at t = 0 without knowing the value of s applied in \\\\( T(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation by \\\\( e^{-sx} \\\\) is a type of Laplace transform which obscures specific details of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) due to integration over x. Without knowing s, the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) cannot be precisely reconstructed from \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\) due to loss of information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T(u) at time t=0 influences the transformed state T(u)(T), and the initial condition u(x,0) is used to determine the transformation T(u)."
