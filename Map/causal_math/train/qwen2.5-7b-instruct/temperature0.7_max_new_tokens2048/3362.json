  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz + d \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, on the function \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, determining if the initial point was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( T(z_0) \\\\) is not possible. The exponential function's sensitivity to initial conditions and linear transformation effects make the original complex number indeterminable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of the function f at z (f(z)) causally influences the value of the function f at Z (f(Z)). The original complex number z0 at z=0 causally influences z. The linear transformation T applied to z causally influences the value of the function f at z (f(z))."
