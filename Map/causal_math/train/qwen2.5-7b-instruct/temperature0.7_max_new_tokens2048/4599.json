  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int \\\\frac{f(w)}{w - z} dw \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is an analytic function defined on a complex domain excluding the point z. The integral is calculated over a closed contour enclosing z. We want to infer changes and effects of applying transformations based on the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf another function transformation \\\\( j(w) = e^{i\\\\phi}w \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is another real constant) is applied to the contour during the integration process, will the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) only depend on the original function \\\\( f(w) \\\\) without bearing effects of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\\\( h(w) \\\\) and \\\\( j(w) \\\\) are rotational transformations which, when applied to the contour over which the integral is taken, do not affect the value of an integral of an analytic function enclosed by the contour. Thus, the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is determined solely by the properties of \\\\( f(w) \\\\), uninfluenced by \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\).",
