  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and we examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. This scenario explores the transformations under different conditions and interventions using the residue theorem from complex analysis.\n\nGiven the final output from a sequence where \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( T(z) \\\\), and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) have been applied, can we determine precisely which transformations and in what order were used, based solely on observing the result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations, particularly when involving linear operations and complex exponentials, can lead to numerous combinations producing the same or indistinguishable results due to the properties of complex functions and additive constants in linear transformations. Therefore, identifying the exact sequence and parameters from the result alone is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
