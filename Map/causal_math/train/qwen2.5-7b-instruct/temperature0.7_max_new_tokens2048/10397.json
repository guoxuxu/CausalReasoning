  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the transformation matrix \\\\( L \\\\) and given an initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in a vector space. We evaluate the effect of an operator \\\\( T \\\\) which applies an integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) affecting the system's evolution.\n\nIf an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) at t = 0, and then evolved under the transformation matrix \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting vector at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) can modify the initial state by integrating across potentially different influences at each point in time or vector component, making the evolution path under \\\\( L \\\\) starting from \\\\( T(x_0) \\\\) different than from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) itself.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x_0, when transformed by the operator T at time t=0 and then evolved under the transformation matrix L, results in the same vector x_t as directly transforming x_0 by L from t=0 to t=T."
