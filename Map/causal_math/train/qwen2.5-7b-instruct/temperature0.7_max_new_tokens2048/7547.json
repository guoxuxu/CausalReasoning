  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects in a system ruled by the partial differential equation \\u2202u/\\u2202t + A\\u2202u/\\u2202x = 0, where A is a constant velocity, under transformations induced by the integral operator T(u) defined \\u2202u/\\u2202x. Analyze how applying Laplace Transforms to u(x,t) influences the solutions.\n\nIf an intervention by adding a function v(x,t) is applied at time t_1, where v is transformed by an additional Laplace Transform, will the solution u(x,T) for T > t_1 be independent of the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of v(x,t) with its own Laplace Transform affects u(x,T). Since the properties of the Laplace Transform in problem setups often affect the evolution (convolution in time), the end solution depends not just on the original PDE but also on how v integrates and transforms in the solution space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant velocity A directly causes the spatial derivative of u with respect to x. The partial derivative of u with respect to t directly causes the change in u over time. Applying the integral operator T to u directly causes the spatial derivative of u with respect to x. Performing Laplace transforms on u directly causes the transformation of u into the s-domain. Introducing a function v at time t_1 directly causes changes in u. Applying Laplace transforms to v directly causes the transformation of v into the s-domain."
