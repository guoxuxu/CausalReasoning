  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) describes the voltage distribution over a line at position x and time t, and v is a positive constant reflecting the properties of the material. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an inverse Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) is applied as an intervention, and then further transformations are applied, will the voltage distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the differential equation and not on the initial or intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) will be influenced by any transformations applied throughout the process, including the initial Fourier transform and any subsequent interventions like the inverse Fourier transformation at \\\\(t_1\\\\). These transformations alter the state of the system, which affects how the differential equation governs its further evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x,t) → u(x,T); v → ∂²u/∂t²; ∂²u/∂x² → ∂²u/∂t²; t1 → intervention; intervention → u(x,t1); u(x,t1) → u(x,T); T → u(x,T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage distribution u(x,t) evolves according to the partial differential equation with v and the spatial second derivative, and this evolution determines u(x,T) for T > t1. An intervention at t1 through an inverse Fourier transformation affects u(x,t1) but does not influence u(x,T) beyond t1, assuming no further interventions."
