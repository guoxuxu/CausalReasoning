  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex-valued differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau}z d\\\\tau \\\\) over time t, where B is a real constant matrix that generally does not commute with A.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) without any further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) influences the initial condition by integrating over an exponential function of B, which shapes the evolutionary path differently from that solely governed by A, thus altering the entire forward trajectory from t=0 to t=T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences z(t) through the differential equation and also indirectly influences g(z) which then affects z(t) through the integral transformation. The matrices A and B determine the dynamics of z(t) and g(z) respectively, with A governing the direct evolution of z(t) and B influencing the integral transformation g(z)."
