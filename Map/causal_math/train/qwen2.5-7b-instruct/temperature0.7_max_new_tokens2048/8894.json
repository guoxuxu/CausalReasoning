  "Problem": "A physical system is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix with distinct eigenvalues. The impact of an external control described by \\\\( h(x) = S x \\\\) on the state x at different time intervals is analyzed, where S is a constant matrix serving as a shift transformation.\n\nGiven the observation of a state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to uniquely determine the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the shift transformation \\\\( S \\\\) was applied, it is not possible to trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely. The effect of \\\\( S \\\\), unless it's an identity matrix or known beforehand, obscures the initial condition by mixing eigen-directions of matrix D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of state x from its initial state x_0 over time, influenced by the dynamics described by D, leads to the observed state x(T) at time T. Without information about the application of the transformation h(x) at t=0, the original state x_0 cannot be uniquely determined from x(T) alone."
