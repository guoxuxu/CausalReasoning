  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\(u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the heat conductivity coefficient, and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Let's analyze the introduction of an external heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\), which varies over time and space, via the modification of the equation to \\\\(u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u + h(x, t)\\\\).\n\nWill the solution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) to the modified heat equation with a specific heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) at time T be the same as it would have been under the original heat equation at the same time and initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) alters the heat distribution within the system by adding energy at varying rates and positions, thus changing the solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) compared to the scenario with no external source.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An external heat source h(x, t) directly influences the time derivative of temperature u_t, which in turn affects the temperature distribution u(x, T) at a later time T. The heat conductivity coefficient κ and the Laplacian operator Δ also directly influence u_t."
