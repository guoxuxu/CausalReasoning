  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistance R in series with an inductance L and a varying voltage source V(t). The voltage and current relationship is given by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI\\\\), where I is the current through the circuit.\n\nGiven the current I(T), can we determine precisely what interventions were made (whether resistance was added or changed, or the voltage was altered), only by knowing the value of I(T)?",
  "Explanation": "The current I(T) at time T can potentially result from various combinations of voltage levels and resistances due to the linear nature of the differential equation governing the circuit. Different voltage and resistance scenarios could yield the same current, making it impossible to uniquely identify the specific interventions based only on I(T).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
