  "Problem": "Let's consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time in the complex plane. We investigate the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specifically ascertain whether initial or intervening transformations were \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or a combination, just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used by merely observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the potential for multiple pathways leading to the same result due to the properties of exponential functions in the complex plane. Multiple combinations of \\\\( t_1 \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could produce identical or indistinguishable endpoints.",
