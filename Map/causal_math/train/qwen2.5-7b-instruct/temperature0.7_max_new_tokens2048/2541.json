  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} [u(x)] = M u(x) \\\\) where M is a linear operator. An operator transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Nx} u(x) \\\\) is introduced, with N being another linear operator. Analyze the influence of this transformation on the behavior of the function u(x) over the domain.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at x = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} [u(x)] = M u(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to x = X under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at the initial condition modifies the solution path by transforming \\\\( u_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{Nx} u_0 \\\\). The new trajectory depends on how N interacts with M, potentially resulting in a different solution at x = X.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T to \\(u_0\\) at x=0 and allowing it to evolve under the differential equation results in the same function u(x) at x=X as directly evolving \\(u_0\\) under the same differential equation."
