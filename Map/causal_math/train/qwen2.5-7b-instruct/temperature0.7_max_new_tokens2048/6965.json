  "Problem": "Let's examine a complex function scenario given by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces a unit circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We are interested in the effect of a transformation using another function, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied to this time-varying function.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = z(0) \\\\) initially and then evolved under the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further application of \\\\( h \\\\), does the resulting path follow the same trajectory as \\\\( z(t) \\\\) squared for all t?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the trajectory from a unit circle to a path described by \\\\( e^{2it} \\\\). This represents a circle in the complex plane but at twice the angular velocity, hence diverging from the simple square of the original path over time.",
