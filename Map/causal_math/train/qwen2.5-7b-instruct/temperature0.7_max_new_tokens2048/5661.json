  "Problem": "We explore the impact of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Here, \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and we define it as \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. The differential operator serves as an integral transformation of the function, possibly altering its domain and behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( g(x) = sin(x) \\\\) and is allowed to transform without further intervention, will the transformed function remain equivalent to the original \\\\( g(x) \\\\) in the transformation's domain?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) = sin(x) \\\\) transforms it into a function in the complex plane, specifically \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \\\\). This is not equivalent to the original trigonometric function, indicating a fundamental transformation in domain and functional expression.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the differential operator L to the function g(x) transforms it into a new function Transformed_g, which is the Laplace transform of g(x). For g(x) = sin(x), this transformation changes the domain from the time domain to the complex frequency domain."
