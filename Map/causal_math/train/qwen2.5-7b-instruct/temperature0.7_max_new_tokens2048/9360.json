  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit composed of a resistor (R), inductor (L), capacitor (C), and a power source that applies a voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system is described by the differential equation \\\\( V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int_0^t I(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the current as a function of time.\n\nGiven the steady state current, can we determine if a parallel resistor \\\\( R_2 \\\\) was added or if adjustments were made to \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\) by observing only the current magnitude, assuming initial conditions and voltage are unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Variations in current magnitude at steady state can result from numerous configuration changes including but not limited to alterations in \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), or the addition of \\\\( R_2 \\\\). Without additional phase information or detailed knowledge of the voltage source or initial conditions, distinguishing among these causes based solely on magnitude is highly ambiguous and inconclusive.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
