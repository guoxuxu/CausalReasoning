  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation in a vector space under the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{(x-t)^2} f(t) dt \\\\). The system's dynamics are influenced by an externally applied multiplicative function \\\\( g(t) = t^2+1 \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf we observe the function \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\) at x = T, can we determine if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was multiplied by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) initially at t = 0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant function at x = T, \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\), does not explicitly reveal modifications by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) unless additional details about the behavior of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are known. The integral transformation obscures direct implications of initial conditions due to the exponential term and the integration.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
