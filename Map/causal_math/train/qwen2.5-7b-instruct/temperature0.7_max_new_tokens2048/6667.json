  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices defining separate dynamical systems for the real and imaginary parts, respectively. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we introduce a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where T > t_1 depend solely on A and B, without any influence from C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further affects the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on the impacts of A, B, C, and D. The multiple matrix exponentials involve complex interactions potentially leading to compositional and non-trivial modifications of the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
