  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = z^2 + cz \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We study how the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, influences the function over time t.\n\nIf a modifying function \\\\( k(z) = z + d \\\\) (where d is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the altered function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by the original differential equation parameters, ignoring the effects of d and s from the original transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) affects the trajectory and final conditions of the function by altering its state at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Both the integral transform's parameter s and the intervention d influence the evolved state at time T through their effects on z’s trajectory and endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The parameter c influences z through the differential equation, t influences z over time, k(z) modifies z at t_1, and s transforms z via h(z), which indirectly affects z(T) for T > t_1."
