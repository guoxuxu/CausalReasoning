  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial function Z(t) described by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA} ds \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf a new complex function \\\\( w(t) = e^{i\\eta t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the final function \\\\( Z(T) \\\\), solely depend on A and not on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\eta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( w(t) \\\\) introduces an additional complex exponential factor that influences both the phase and magnitude of the evolving function, making the final value \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) dependent on A, \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and \\\\( \\eta \\\\), due to their combined effects on the state dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
