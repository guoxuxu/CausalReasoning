  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) is examined in terms of how it modifies the behavior of this function over time.\n\nKnowing the final transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(T)) \\\\), can we accurately decide which transformations (original or intervention) were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(T)) \\\\) results from a complex interplay of the exponential characteristics of the differential equations and any interventions. Given the integral and exponential overlay in Laplace transformations, it is difficult to disentangle and identify specific contributions from the original state management or subsequent interventions without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A directly causes changes in x(t); B directly causes changes in y(t); changes in x(t) and y(t) lead to the evolution of z(t); the Laplace transformation of z(t) at time T influences the final transformed state."
