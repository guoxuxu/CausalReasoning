  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), transitioning through the system defined by \\\\(z' = z^2 + c\\\\), where c is a complex constant. This scenario examines causal inference in system's transformations and their reversibility.\n\nIf an intervention changes the constant c to a new value \\\\(c'\\\\) at a time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), will the final state at T only depend on the original parameters and not on the change to \\\\(c'\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constant c to \\\\(c'\\\\) during the evolution alters the trajectory of the complex function, thereby directly influencing the endpoints. The dependency on both initial conditions and intervened conditions means the final state at T depends on \\\\(c'\\\\) as well as the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in c directly causes a change in z' through the transformation z' = z^2 + c. Since z' at time t_1 depends on the current value of z and c, and z evolves based on previous values of z and c, the final state at T depends on the entire history of c and z from the initial conditions to T."
