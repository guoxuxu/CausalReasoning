  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), which transforms a time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into its Laplace Transform domain representative \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Suppose an original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A is a scalar, and its behavior under perturbation represented by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-Bt}f(t) \\\\), where B is also a scalar.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we deduce \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at the start without knowledge of \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( B \\\\), the exact form of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be deduced from \\\\( G(s) \\\\). The transformation involves a decay factor \\\\( e^{-Bt} \\\\), fundamentally altering the temporal characteristics and decoupling them from the original \\\\( A \\\\) without additional information.",
