  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and we examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. This scenario explores the transformations under different conditions and interventions using the residue theorem from complex analysis.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( f(T(z)) \\\\), can we reliably compute the original \\\\( z \\\\) value without knowing the transformation parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z \\\\) because multiple values via different transformations might yield the same output due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane and the general effect of linear transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(z) is directly caused by the complex constants a and b. Applying T(z) results in w, and knowing w and either a or b allows for the computation of z, assuming a is non-zero."
