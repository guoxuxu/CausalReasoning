  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time. We are interested in the effect of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied on this function, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\. The study involves the s-parameter effects and system behavior transformations.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = t + i(t + 3)^2 \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) at s = 2 only reflect the influence of the original function and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), specifically changing the imaginary part, which distinctly affects the integral in the Laplace transform. The new term \\\\( (t + 3)^2 \\\\) changes the decay characteristics and values in the transform, reflecting both the original function and the effect of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is influenced by u(t) and v(t), and its Laplace transform L(z)(s) depends on z(t) and the parameter s. An intervention at t_1 modifies z(t), which can be reflected in L(z)(s) depending on the interval of integration."
