  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system where the position of a particle, \\(s(t)\\), is influenced by a complex potential \\(U(z) = V(x) + iW(y)\\), where \\(z = x + iy\\). The movement is governed by the equation \\(\\dot{z}(t) = U'(z)\\). We assess the impact of linear transformations \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) defined by the matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}\\), and their effect over time \\(t\\).\n\nIf transformation \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) is initially applied to position \\(z_0\\) at t = 0, and then \\(z(t)\\) is allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{z} = U'(z)\\) without further intervention, will \\(z(T)\\) at time T be the same as if \\(z_0\\) evolved to T under \\(\\dot{z} = U'(z)\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) alters \\(z_0\\) to \\(\\mathbf{T}z_0\\). Since \\(U'(z)\\) can depend complexly on both real and imaginary components \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the trajectory from \\(\\mathbf{T}z_0\\) under \\(\\dot{z} = U'(z)\\) potentially follows a path distinct from that starting at \\(z_0\\), depending on the nature of \\(U'\\) and the values in \\(\\mathbf{T}\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of the complex potential U'(z) directly influences the position z(t) over time. The initial position z_0 at time T=0 influences z(0), and the evolution of z(t) from z_0 under the influence of U'(z) determines z(T). Linear transformations T do not directly affect z(t) unless applied continuously."
