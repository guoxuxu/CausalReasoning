  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\( \\\\Delta T \\\\) in a body is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We examine the effect of an external heating process described by \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}\\\\Delta T_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature difference.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another external cooling process \\\\( c(t) = e^{-Ct}\\\\Delta T \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final temperature difference \\\\( \\\\Delta T(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the natural cooling constant k and not on A or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( c(t) \\\\) introduces an additional external factor, making the final state \\\\( \\\\Delta T(T) \\\\) dependent on the constants A, C, and k. The interplay between the exponential heating and cooling adjustments affects the trajectory and final state of the temperature difference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature difference ΔT_0, the heating process h(t), the cooling process c(t), and the natural cooling constant k directly influence the temperature difference ΔT. The constants A and C affect h(t) and c(t) respectively but do not directly influence ΔT beyond their impact on h(t) and c(t)."
