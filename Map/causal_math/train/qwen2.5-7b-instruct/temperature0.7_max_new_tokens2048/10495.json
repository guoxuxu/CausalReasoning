  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nIf an intervention occurs where an additional function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Fourier Transform be a simple addition of the Fourier Transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of the sum of two functions is the sum of their Fourier Transforms (linearity of the Fourier Transform). Hence, adding \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and then transforming the result will simply add the Fourier Transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to that of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
