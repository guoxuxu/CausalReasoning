  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We introduce a transformation using the integral operator \\\\( I[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}f(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( I[z](t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves thereafter under the combined dynamics of \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further modification, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved directly under its own dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation \\\\( I[z](t) \\\\) alters the initial state in a complex manner, influenced by the integration and matrix exponential involving C. This manipulation changes the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), resulting in a state at time T that differs from the unaltered evolutionary path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of z(t) at t=T is influenced by the initial conditions x(t) and y(t), which evolve according to the dynamics A and B respectively. Applying the integral operator I[z](0) at t=0 modifies the initial conditions but does not change the underlying dynamics A and B, thus the state of z(T) will be the same as if z(t) was evolved directly under its own dynamics."
