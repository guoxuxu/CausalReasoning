  "Problem": "Investigate a system characterized by the continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) of a signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), denoted as \\\\(X(f)\\\\). Explore how the multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) in the time domain, where \\\\(f_0\\\\) is a frequency offset, affects the transform.\n\nGiven a shifted spectrum \\\\(X(f-f_0)\\\\), can we unequivocally determine that the original signal was multiplied by \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) without knowing the original form of \\\\(X(f)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without a priori knowledge of the original spectrum \\\\(X(f)\\\\), it is not possible to confirm whether the shift was due to multiplication by \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) or if the original signal itself had a different form. Other factors or transformations could potentially yield a similar shifted spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplication by \\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\) in the time domain shifts the spectrum to \\(X(f-f_0)\\), which represents a shifted spectrum."
