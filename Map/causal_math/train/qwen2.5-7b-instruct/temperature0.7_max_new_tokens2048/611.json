  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\) within the context of complex dynamics, particularly the study of Julia sets, where z and c are complex numbers. This function iteratively generates complex sequences which may display convergence to fixed points or divergence to infinity.\n\nIf \\( c \\) is altered to a different value \\( c' \\) at some iteration and held constant thereafter, will the sequence still show the same behavior in terms of convergence or divergence as it would have under the constant original \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the value of \\( c \\) to \\( c' \\) modifies the function \\( f \\) significantly and can greatly affect the behavior of its orbits. This means that the orbits' nature (converging or diverging) might change, leading to different dynamical behavior than under the original \\( c \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
