  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real-valued parameter. We explore different transformations including the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), we modify \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z(t) = e^{2it} \\) and then apply the Laplace Transform, will the outcome \\( L(z)(s) \\) at s=i be dependent only on the modified function and not on initial \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification to \\( e^{2it} \\) affects the integral, resulting in a fundamentally different Laplace transform. Since \\( L(z)(s) \\) integrates over all t from 0 to infinity, it combines effects from both the initial and modified functions unless the change happens precisely at \\( t = 0 \\).",
