  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze changes in solution behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = e^{\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the solution \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\), can we determine the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the scaling effect \\\\( e^{\\\\omega t} \\\\) on the evolution of the initial conditions cannot be uniquely reversed, as different values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could yield the same final state after scaling differently.",
