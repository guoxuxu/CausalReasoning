  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{L}u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a function of both space and time, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on the system and querying causality with and without intervention.\n\nSuppose an intervention is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) by modifying the conditions via an additional Fourier filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\), does the end state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original differential operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) and not the filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the additional Fourier filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\) alters the subsequent state evolution, affecting both the amplitude and phase characteristics in the frequency domain. Thus, the final state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\\\) incorporates effects of both the original operator and the characteristics of the filter applied mid-evolution.",
