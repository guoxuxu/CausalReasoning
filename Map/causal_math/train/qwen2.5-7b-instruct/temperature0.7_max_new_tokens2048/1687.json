  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagation described by the second order partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial t^2 = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) with a perturbation function \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf a new function \\\\(g(u) = u e^{\\\\mu t}\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the wave profile\\\\(u(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the wave equation's constant \\\\(c\\\\) and not by \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an intervention such as \\\\(g(u) = u e^{\\\\mu t}\\\\) introduces additional factors that will alter the wave's evolution. This change depends on both the initial perturbation by \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and the intervention by \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\), each contributing exponentially to the profile's transformation and thus influencing the state of \\\\(u(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(u) → u; g(u) → u; c → u; λ → f(u); μ → g(u); t_1 → g(u)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The wave profile u(T) for T > t_1 is influenced by the constant c through the wave equation, but not by λ or μ because g(u) does not affect u after t_1."
