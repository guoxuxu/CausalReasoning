  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\) obtained from the Laplace transformation, can we uniquely determine the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The structure of the transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\) explicitly reveals \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the imaginary part of the pole. Thus, the original frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be directly identified from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
