  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the effect of a Laplace transformation on a continuous function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by the transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), is studied in relation to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}f(t) = ag(t) + bf(t) \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( g(t) \\\\) mid-way in the process, such as changing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + ct^2 \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) still reflect the original linkage to the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( ct^2 \\\\) changes the functional form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and thus, affects \\\\( G(s) \\\\). Since the differential equation integrates these effects systemically, the final \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) isn't solely governed by the original behavior or transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and the alteration will manifest in the final state of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying g(t) to g(t) + ct^2 at t1 changes G(s) to G'(s), which in turn affects F(s) to F'(s), and subsequently influences f(t) from F'(s) at t = T."
