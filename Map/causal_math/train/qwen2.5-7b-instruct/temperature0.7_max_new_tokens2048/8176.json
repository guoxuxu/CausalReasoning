  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = ze^{z} \\\\) and its Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation and its ability to highlight causality within the calculations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform output, can we specify exactly which transformations (like \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)) were applied during the formation of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the variety of possible transformations and their non-trivial effects when combined, it's not feasible to distinctly determine the sequence or type of interventions that were applied to result in a specific \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The overlapping impacts and the potential for equivalent outcomes from different transformations contribute to this indeterminacy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) is transformed into F(s) through the Laplace transform, while g(z) and h(z) are also potential functions that could be transformed into F(s) via the Laplace transform."
