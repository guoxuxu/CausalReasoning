  "Problem": "In a control system analysis, the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) acts on a state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. We explore the changes in state space when applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) at different points in time t.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t=0 confidently without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes non-trivial as the transformation by \\\\( e^{tC} \\\\) can significantly alter the initial conditions. Moreover, the non-reversible nature of matrix exponentiation with unknown C complicates the recovery of initial states.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state vector z(T) is influenced by both the transformation g(z) applied at t=0 and the transformation h(z) applied at some point in time t. The original state vector z_0 at t=0 influences z(T) through g(z) and z(T) also influences z_0 indirectly through h(z)."
