  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(x, t) = xe^{At} \\\\), where A is a constant scalar. We evaluate the results of incorporating an operational matrix, \\\\( P(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant scalar, impacting the function over time t.\n\nKnowing the end state of \\\\( z(x, T) \\\\), can we accurately back-calculate and confirm if and when the intervention \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the variability and interdependence of factors A and B in the exponential operations, multiple combinations of timing and application of \\\\( P(t) \\\\) could lead to similar or even identical outcomes at T. Without additional information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the details related to the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
