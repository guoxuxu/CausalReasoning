  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2} = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) with boundary conditions. We explore the system response under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) and consider the dynamics when impacted by an operation \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t}\\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention using \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect solely the properties of the original PDE without considering \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the transformed state, influencing its evolution by introducing an additional phase shift dependent on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). This modification affects the resultant state at \\\\( T \\\\), making it dependent not only on the original PDE but also on the intervention applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning.
