  "Problem": "Investigate the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\) to a complex variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nCan we infer the initial variable \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if we know \\\\( x(T) \\\\) without understanding whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Owing to the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\), which squares \\\\( x \\\\) and adds a complex constant, without knowing its application, any back calculation from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) lacks certainty. Multiple values of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) might correspond to the same \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to the non-injectiveness of the quadratic transformation in complex numbers.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of x at time T (x(T)) depends on the value of x at time t (x(t)), which evolves according to the rate k; the function h(x) depends on the value of x(t); the constant c influences the form of the function h(x)."
