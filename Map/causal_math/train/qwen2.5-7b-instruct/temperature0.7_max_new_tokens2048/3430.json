  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform applied to a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\), and let the transformed function be \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\). Assume the operation of convolution with another function \\\\(g(x)\\\\) in the time domain, consequently leading to a multiplication by \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\(g(x)\\\\), in the frequency domain.\n\nBy only knowing the product \\\\(F(\\\\omega)G(\\\\omega)\\\\) in the frequency domain, can we uniquely determine the original functions \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and \\\\(g(x)\\\\) used for convolution?",
  "Explanation": "The product \\\\(F(\\\\omega)G(\\\\omega)\\\\) does not uniquely identify the individual functions due to the potential for multiple function pairs having the same Fourier transform product. Additional information about either \\\\(f(x)\\\\) or \\\\(g(x)\\\\) would be necessary to uniquely resolve the original functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
