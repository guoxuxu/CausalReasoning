  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor having capacitance C described by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\\\omega^2 q = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q\\\\) is the charge on the capacitor and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. Investigate the transformation of the system state when subjected to an external sinusoidal voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nKnowing the charge \\\\(q(T)\\\\) at some time T after the capacitance change intervention, can we infer precisely whether the capacitance was changed from C to \\\\(C'\\\\) or if other interventions were made?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(q(T)\\\\) might result from multiple plausible scenarios involving different sequences or types of interventions, such as changes in other circuit elements or additional sources. Given the complexity of possible system states and non-unique solutions, multiple histories could lead to the observed \\\\(q(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "V(t) → q(t); C → d^2q/dt^2; C' → d^2q/dt^2; ω → d^2q/dt^2; V_0 → q(t); T → q(T); C ≠ C' → different d^2q/dt^2",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An external sinusoidal voltage source V(t) influences the charge q(t) on a capacitor. Capacitance C affects the second derivative of charge with respect to time (d^2q/dt^2). A change in capacitance from C to C' alters d^2q/dt^2. Different values of ω also affect d^2q/dt^2. Knowing q(T) does not allow precise inference of whether C was changed to C' or if other interventions were made."
