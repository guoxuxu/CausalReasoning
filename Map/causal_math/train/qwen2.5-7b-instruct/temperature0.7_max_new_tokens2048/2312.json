  "Problem": "Assume a complex signal processing system that employs a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), to convert time domain signals, \\\\( s(t) \\\\), into frequency domain representations. We analyze the causal effects of applying an inverse Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(F) \\\\), and modifications to the signal post transform.\n\nGiven the final output after applying both Fourier transform and inverse Laplace transform with an unknown intermediate filtering action \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine the specific nature of the intervention \\\\( H(s) \\\\) solely from the final output?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific filter characteristics or even verifying its use from the final output alone is implausible due to the transformations’ complexity and the multitude of filters that could yield similar outputs. Detailed properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), such as its frequency response, are necessary to trace back and confirm the exact nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original time domain signal s(t) is transformed into the frequency domain representation F(s) through the Fourier transform. The frequency domain representation F(s) is then modified by the filter H(s) before being converted back to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transform L^{-1}(F)."
