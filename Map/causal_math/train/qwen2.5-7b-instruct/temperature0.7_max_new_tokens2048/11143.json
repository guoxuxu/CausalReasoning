  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = w^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We evaluate the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention is made such that the path of \\\\( w \\\\) is altered to avoid the origin midway through the transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depend only on the new segment of the path and not the sections before the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depends on the entire path of \\\\( w \\\\) due to the continuous nature of the integral and the transformation's dependency on all parts of the path before and after the intervention. Any segments circumventing the origin still affect the transformation.",
