  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + Dx\\\\), with constant coefficients A, B, C, and D. The effect of a linear transformation \\\\(T\\\\) described by the matrix \\\\(\\\\begin{pmatrix} E & F \\\\\\\\ G & H \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\) is analyzed.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(T\\\\), reversing the complex function's state evolution to obtain \\\\(z_0\\\\) accurately is uncertain, as the transformation could have changed initial conditions in various ways depending on E, F, G, and H values, rendering backwards computation non-unique.",
