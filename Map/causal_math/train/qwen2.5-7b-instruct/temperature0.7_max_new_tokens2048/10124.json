  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\), which operates in the complex plane. The impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\\\) is investigated, where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of a modified function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f'(z)\\}(s)\\\\), can we determine exactly what functions were added (\\\\(g(z)\\\\)) or how \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was modified, only by knowing the resultant transform?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the nature and properties of the intervention (i.e., what \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was used), multiple possible modifications could result in the same Laplace Transform due to the loss of information in the transformation process and potential function overlap.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
