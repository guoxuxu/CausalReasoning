  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, D as constants. We explore the impact of the integral transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), applied at time t.\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the presence and exact formation of transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) used, by solely examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexities introduced by potential overlapping effects of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), each integrating the function over different time periods and possibly influencing the outcome in non-distinctive ways, obfuscate any definitive reverse engineering from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) back to the specifics of \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\). The compounded effects and possible interdependencies between \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) make it impossible to ascertain their individual impacts precisely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The values of x(t) and y(t) directly influence z(t); the integral transformation f(z) affects z(T), but without additional information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the specific forms of f(z) and g(z) just from z(T)."
