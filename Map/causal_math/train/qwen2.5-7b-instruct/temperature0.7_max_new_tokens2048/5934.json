  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) obey the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. We explore the scenario by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we reconstruct the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) accurately for all t?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, if \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is known for all \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be perfectly reconstructed using the inverse Fourier transform, assuming no information loss in the transformation process.",
