  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit system where the voltage across a capacitor (V) is related to the charge (Q) by the relation \\\\( V = \\\\frac{Q}{C} \\\\) where C is the capacitance. Additionally, a sinusoidal input voltage is transformed by a Laplace transformation, resulting in a transformed output that is affected by the system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output voltage V(T), can we determine exactly which capacitance (C or C') and when the addition or change of the capacitor took place during the time interval [0, T], based only on the output voltage V(T)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios could result in the same voltage V(T), especially since the change in capacitance and the timing of such changes impact the system dynamics in a non-trivial way. It would be ambiguous to pinpoint exactly when or what intervention might have occurred without additional information about other system states or input characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
