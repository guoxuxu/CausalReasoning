  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\dot{u} = Ku\\\\), with K being a constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is infeasible. \\\\( e^{Lt} \\\\) can introduce phases and exponential growths that cannot be unwound uniquely without specific knowledge of L and its relationship with K and \\\\(\\omega\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
