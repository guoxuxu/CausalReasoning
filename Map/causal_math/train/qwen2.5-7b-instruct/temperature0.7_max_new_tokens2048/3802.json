  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem described by the Navier-Stokes equation in a two-dimensional domain. The velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) of the fluid is influenced by a forcing function \\\\( \\\\vec{F}(x,t) \\\\). We are exploring the effect of a transformation applied to the velocity field: \\\\( \\\\vec{u}'(x,t) = \\\\vec{u}(x,t) + \\\\nabla \\\\phi(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential function.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether the transformation with \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) to the initial velocity field, it is impossible to trace back reliably to \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0(x) \\\\) due to the potential modifications imposed by \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), which influence the flow characteristics uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The forcing function vec{F}(x,t) directly influences the velocity field vec{u}(x,t); the velocity field vec{u}(x,t) is transformed into vec{u}'(x,t) through the addition of the gradient of a scalar potential function; the transformed velocity field vec{u}'(x,t) evolves over time to become vec{u}(x,T); the initial condition of the velocity field vec{u}(x,0) determines the initial state vec{u}_0(x)."
