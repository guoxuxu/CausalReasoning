  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We examine the influence of an external heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) modeled by the transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + q(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using a new external cooling function \\\\( g(u) = u - r(x,t) \\\\) (where \\\\( r(x,t) \\\\) is a cooling function) is applied, will the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the initial heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) or cooling function \\\\( r(x,t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) and the cooling intervention \\\\( r(x,t) \\\\) alter the temperature profiles at their respective times of application, affecting the evolution process and the final state at \\\\( T \\\\). They play crucial roles in determining the temperature distribution alongside the inherent properties of the heat diffusion characterized by \\\\( k \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An external heat source q(x,t) and a cooling function r(x,t) both directly influence the temperature distribution u(x,t). The initial state u(x,t_1) influences the final state u(x,T), but this dependency also includes the effects of q(x,t) and r(x,t) over time."
