  "Problem": "Assess the relations within a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diagonalizable constant matrix. We explore interventions and transformations mediated through the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is deployed on vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system allowed to evolve as per \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) without additional interventions, will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for a given T be identical to the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) modifies the initial condition, thereby altering the trajectory of the system. Assuming \\\\( M \\\\) is not the identity matrix, \\\\( z(T) = e^{DT}Mx_0 \\\\) would not be the same as \\\\( e^{DT}x_0 \\\\), directly impacted by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformation h(x) to x_0 at t=0 and then evolving the result according to z(t) = e^{Dt}x for time T will yield the same z(T) as evolving x_0 directly according to z(t) = e^{Dt}x for time T, assuming h(x) = Mx and M is a constant matrix."
