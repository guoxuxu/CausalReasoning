  "Problem": "In a controlled heat transfer system, the temperature function, \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution according to the function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nCan we accurately recover the original unaltered initial temperature distribution from observing \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t without knowing that function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\), any observed temperature distribution at subsequent times cannot be uniquely traced back to determine the original state before applying \\\\( f(x) \\\\). The impact of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) on the initial conditions obscures the original temperature profile.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The external heat source function f(x) influences the temperature distribution T(x,t) over time. The thermal diffusivity constant k determines the rate of change of temperature with respect to position squared (∂²T/∂x²), while the rate of change of temperature with respect to time (∂T/∂t) is proportional to this spatial second derivative."
