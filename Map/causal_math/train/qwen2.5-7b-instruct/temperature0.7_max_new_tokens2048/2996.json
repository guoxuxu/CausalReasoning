  "Problem": "Consider a vector space V over complex numbers, governed by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\). The causal structure of the system is manipulated using a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(t) e^{-iwt} dt \\\\), where w represents angular frequency and v(t) is a vector in V at time t.\n\nCan we unequivocally determine the specific transforms applied (Fourier, \\\\( G \\\\), or both) by only analyzing the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), knowing they might have been used?",
  "Explanation": "The combination of transformations such as Fourier and \\\\( G \\\\) along with the linear dynamics of \\\\( L \\\\) can generate overlapping or indistinguishable effects at time T, making it challenging to trace back and identify what specific operations were applied to reach the observed state \\\\( u(T) \\\\). The transformations' effects might mask or simulate each other, thereby blurring the causal pathway.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
