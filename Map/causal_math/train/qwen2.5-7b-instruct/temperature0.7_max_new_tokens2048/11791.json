  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real number. To analyze causal effects, we introduce interventions using the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we determine exactly what interventions were applied, whether it be \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both, by only analyzing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions (\\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\)) can lead to the same output state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) due to the properties of complex exponentials. This overlap implies that knowing the endpoint alone does not provide sufficient information to definitively identify the nature or sequence of interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time T directly causes the state z(T). The complex number C directly causes the transformation g(z). No direct causal link exists between h(z) and z(T); however, h(z) could indirectly affect z(T) through its potential influence on z."
