  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a complex constant. Investigate the influence of the transformation defined by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Bt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which affects the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since B influences the exponential growth rate and direction differently from A, the state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), differs from that obtained by direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under A alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
