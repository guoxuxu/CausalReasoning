  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) on the complex plane, and we are studying its transformation through a complex contour integral \\\\(I(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u(z) dz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple, closed contour and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf a parameter adjustment function \\\\( g(t) = t^a \\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant) is applied to the integral at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), so the new integral becomes \\\\( I''(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{g(t)z} u(z) dz \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), will the outcome be independent of the original \\\\(k\\\\) in \\\\(u(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The adjusted parameter \\\\( g(t) \\\\) does not negate the dependency on the original power \\\\(k\\\\) of \\\\(z\\\\) in \\\\(u(z)\\\\). Instead, it modifies how the exponential term interacts with the contour path and \\\\(u(z)\\\\), adding or exposing additional dependencies based on both \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k in u(z) does not directly influence the outcome of I''(t) because u(z) is transformed by g(t) such that the integral I''(t) depends on g(t)z instead of kz."
