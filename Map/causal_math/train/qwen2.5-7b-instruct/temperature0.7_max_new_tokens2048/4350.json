  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) on the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real, positive constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The impact of transforming the system using \\\\( z(t) x(t) \\\\) is studied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nUpon observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) after it has evolved, is it possible to determine the initial function \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely without knowing if the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely derived because the observed \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could be modified by the phase and magnitude changes of the complex exponential, verifying its application is crucial.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function x(t) changes over time t due to the differential equation's rate of change. The presence of z(t) transforms x(t) into z(t)x(t). Without knowing z(t), determining the initial function x_0 from x(T) is not unique."
