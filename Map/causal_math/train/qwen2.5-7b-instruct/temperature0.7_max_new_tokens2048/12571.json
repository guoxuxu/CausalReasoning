  "Problem": "Imagine a system of differential equations given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = Kz(t)\\\\), where K is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}z(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nBased on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine the transformations used (like \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( q(z) \\\\) or both) throughout the system's evolution, solely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were applied during the system’s evolution by only evaluating \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the overlapping effects of matrix exponentials and the integrating operation. Different combinations of transformations could lead to the same final state due to the non-distinct and potentially similar evolving paths they engender.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state of z at time t influences its final state z(T), and the matrix M transforms z through integration to produce h(z). The matrix K governs the change of z over time."
