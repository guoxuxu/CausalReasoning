  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\mu |z|^2z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real frequency parameter, and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is a nonlinear growth rate parameter. Now, let's the consider the Fourier transform of the solution \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the state at T > t_1, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(T)\\\\}\\\\) where an unknown intervention has occurred, can we determine whether the parameter \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) was altered during the period from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "From the Fourier transform at T alone, it is challenging to absolutely ascertain if an intervention like adjusting \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) took place unless specific characteristics or markers were known pre and post-intervention. Multiple interventions could result in similar spectral features, making it infeasible to distinguish uniquely based on the Fourier transform alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The parameters ω and μ directly cause the rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt), which in turn influences the Fourier transform of z at time T (F{z(T)})."
