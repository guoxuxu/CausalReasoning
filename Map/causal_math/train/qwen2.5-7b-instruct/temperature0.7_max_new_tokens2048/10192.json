  "Problem": "Investigate a control system where the growth rate of a population \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\), with r being a growth constant. An intervention is performed using a function \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), where k is another constant, to modify the instantaneous growth rate at a specific time point.\n\nKnowing the population at t = T, can we definitely identify whether the intervention \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\) was applied, based solely on \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios (different values of k or variations in intervention timing) could lead to the same final population size at t = T. Without additional information, it is impossible to ascertain the specific intervention parameters or even confirm the occurrence of an intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The population growth rate y(t) directly influences its change over time dy/dt; applying the intervention h(y) = y^k modifies the growth rate dy/dt."
