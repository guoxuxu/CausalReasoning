  "Problem": "Consider a vector field expressed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. Analyze the effect when a Möbius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\) is applied to z, where a, b, c, d are complex constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{pz + q}{rz + s} \\\\) (where p, q, r, s are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both the original Möbius transformation and the new intervention. Each transformation can fundamentally change the trajectory and hence the endpoint by modifying the complex plane in which the dynamics occur.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z (A → \\dot{z}) is influenced by the initial transformation f(z) → z, and an additional intervention g(z) → z modifies z, potentially affecting \\dot{z}."
