  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nObserving a vector \\\\( v(t) \\\\) in the transformed basis, can we uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) if we only know the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) but not whether it was used?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( P^{-1}v \\\\) was used, the relationship between \\\\( v_0 \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) can only be hypothesized, not definitely established. Multiple vectors could potentially produce the observed \\\\( v(t) \\\\) in different bases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
