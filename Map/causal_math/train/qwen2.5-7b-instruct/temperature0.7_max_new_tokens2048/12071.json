  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a linear operator in a complex function space, and \\\\( x \\\\) is an initial complex function. We explore the impacts of a Laplace transform intervention defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), analyzing its interactions over various scenarios.\n\nKnowing the result of a Laplace transform applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a point s, can we deduce the exact form of \\\\( x \\\\), the initial function, and affirm whether any intervention, specifically the use of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and the operation of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) change the function in a way that generally obscures the underlying original function \\\\( x \\\\). The transformation to the s-domain masks the specifics of temporal evolution and A's influence, thereby precluding definitive inferences about \\\\( x \\\\) or the exact interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
