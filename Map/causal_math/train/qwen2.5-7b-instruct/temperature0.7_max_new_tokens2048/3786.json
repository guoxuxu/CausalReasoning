  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{at + bi} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and represent the growth rate and oscillation frequency, respectively. The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the system properties.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at + bi} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z_0(t) = e^{at} \\\\) without knowing whether the oscillation component \\\\( e^{bi} \\\\) was included?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the inclusion of the \\\\( e^{bi} \\\\) component, it is impossible to deduce whether the original function was purely exponential growth or included an oscillatory component. The added complexity of the sinusoidal term modifies the Laplace transform in a way that cannot be simply decomposed without further data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
