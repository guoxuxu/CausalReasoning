  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\phi & -\\sin \\phi \\\\ \\sin \\phi & \\cos \\phi \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) representing a rotation by an angle \\\\( \\phi \\\\) on the complex plane.\n\nIf at time t = T/2, a new rotation \\\\( B \\\\) with a different angle \\\\( \\psi \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T exclusively depend on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) rather than on \\\\( \\phi \\\\) or \\\\( \\psi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a second rotation \\\\( B \\\\) introduces another angular displacement, altering the trajectory on the complex plane, which means the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the values of \\\\( \\omega, \\phi, \\\\) and \\\\( \\psi \\\\). The composite effect of these rotations alters the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) on the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
