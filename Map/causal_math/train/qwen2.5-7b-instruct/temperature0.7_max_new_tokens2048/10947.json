  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\( z(t) \\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\) applied to this system, where \\( k \\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention \\( g(z) = e^{ct}z \\) (where \\( c \\) is a complex constant) is applied at time \\( t_1 < T \\), does the state \\( z(T) \\) solely depend on \\( i \\omega \\) and not on \\( k \\) or \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the trajectory again by adding another scaling factor \\( e^{ct} \\). Therefore, the state \\( z(T) \\) depends on \\( k \\), \\( c \\), and \\( i \\omega \\), as \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) potentially modify the state in complex and overlapping ways depending on the values of \\( k \\) and \\( c \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) depends on iω, but interventions k and c do not affect the final state z(T) if they are applied before T."
