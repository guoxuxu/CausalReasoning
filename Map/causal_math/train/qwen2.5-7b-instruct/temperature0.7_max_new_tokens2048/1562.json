  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of resistors, inductors, and capacitors governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\\\alpha \\\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\\\beta v = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. We explore the influence of an input signal transformation defined by \\\\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\\\) where s is a complex constant, investigating its effect over time t.\n\nKnowing the voltage \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original voltage \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge about the application of \\\\( g(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\) can potentially alter the initial state \\\\( v_0 \\\\) in such a way that reconstructing \\\\( v_0 \\\\) from \\\\( v(T) \\\\) without confirmation of the transformation's application is ambiguous. The compound effect of the exponent influencing the voltage trajectory makes reverse calculation unreliable without complete system history.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage at time T (v(T)) is influenced by the original voltage at time 0 (v_0) through the transformation g(v), and knowing v(T) allows us to infer v_0."
