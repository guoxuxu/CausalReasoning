  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(x) = Qx \\) is applied as an intervention, does the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on K and not on Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( h(x) \\) introduces another level of transformation, making the final state \\( x(T) \\) dependent on the effects of both the initial transformation \\( Q^{-1} \\) and the intervention \\( Q \\), in addition to the system matrix K. The behavior is shaped by how these transformations interact with K.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The endpoint x(T) depends on K through the differential equation and is influenced by x(t_1), which in turn is affected by Q. Thus, while the endpoint x(T) ultimately depends on K, Q indirectly influences it through its effect on x(t_1)."
