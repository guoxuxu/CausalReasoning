  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nKnowing the final calculation of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) for T > intermediate time following interventions by \\\\( g(z) \\\\\\), can we distinctly deduce the type of interventions (variable values of S and U) applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific values of S and U solely from the final value of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is impractical because multiple combinations of these variables can potentially result in the same output. The non-linear and overlapping effects of the exponential functions render such a determination ambiguous and not unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant complex number D influences the function z, which is integrated to produce h through the constant complex number S. Interventions by g lead to changes in h."
