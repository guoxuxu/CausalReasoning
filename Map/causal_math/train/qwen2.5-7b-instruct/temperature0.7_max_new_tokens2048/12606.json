  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\), where C is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where D is a linear operator and S is an invertible matrix, over time t.\n\nAssume another function \\\\( k(z) = Q^{-1}e^{Et}Qz \\\\) (where E is a linear operator and Q is an invertible matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces a new transformation that, along with the initial \\\\( h(z) \\\\), collectively affects the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The influences of D, E, S, and Q together dictate the ultimate state, not just the original operator C or the later E alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) at time t1 influences the state z(t1), which then directly influences the endpoint z(T) for T > t1. The transformation k(z) applied later does not independently affect z(T) because it starts from z(t1), the state after h(z) has been applied."
