  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nBased on observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), deducing the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is not feasible given that \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) could distort the initial state in a manner untraceable backwards, especially if \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) do not commute.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "z(T) is derived from z_0 through the transformation defined by g(z) and the differential equation. P influences the rate of change of z with respect to time. Q defines the transformation g(z) which maps z at time 0 to z at time T."
