  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation studied involves the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan the original conditions or nature of interventions (type or parameters of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) or \\\\( P(z) \\\\)) be deduced accurately just from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), assuming multiple interventions could have occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the overlapping effects of integral and subsequent transformations obfuscate the exact sequence and nature of interventions, leading to multiple potential paths and interventions explaining the same final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
