  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We explore different causal influences on the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its inverse transformations under varying conditions.\n\nGiven only the transformed function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was exactly \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) without any other possibilities?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) uniquely leads back to \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\). The mapping from the Laplace domain back to the time domain preserves uniqueness in this context, enabling us to deduce the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
