  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z a complex variable. We examine the effect of an integral tranformation \\\\( h(g) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt} g(z) dt \\\\), with B as another constant matrix, over an interval [0, T].\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is defined over the interval [0, T] and then transformed by \\\\( h(g) \\\\), will the function \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) hold the same properties as \\\\( g(z) \\\\) multiplied by the integral factor?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation involves a convolution with another exponential function specified by B, which modifies the properties of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Depending on the relationship between A and B, the behavior of the resultant function \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) could be substantially different from a mere scalar multiplication of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(g)(z) is influenced by A, B, and T through the integral transformation, altering its properties from those of g(z) due to the interaction of these matrices and the integration over the interval [0, T]."
