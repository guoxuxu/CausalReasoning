  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where both A and B are constant matrices. To study the behavior of the system, an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, with s being a complex parameter.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the original system without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) essentially changes the representation from time domain to complex frequency domain, altering how the dynamics are observed and analyzed. As this transformation is a form of integration, it aggregates the history of the system up to time T, which cannot be inverted to yield the same state as direct evolution without such a transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at time t is determined by u(t) and v(t). The evolution of u(t) is governed by matrix A, while the evolution of v(t) is governed by matrix B. Time t influences both u(t) and v(t). The parameter s transforms z(t) through integration, resulting in h(z). The state h(z)(T) at time T depends on the integral transformation applied to z(t) over time."
