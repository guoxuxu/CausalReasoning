  "Problem": "Assume we are dealing with a circuit system characterized by a linear transformation given by a matrix product \\\\( R = MC \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix representing the Maxwell's equations and \\\\( C \\\\) represents electrical properties of materials like capacitance and resistance.\n\nIf an intervention is applied altering the capacitance and resistance properties represented by matrix \\\\( C \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the later system's response \\\\( R \\\\) exclusively depend on the original Maxwell matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and not the altered \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in matrix \\\\( C \\\\) due to the intervention adjusts how the material properties interact within the Maxwell's framework. Thus, the resultant response \\\\( R \\\\) at any later time will reflect both the original Maxwell's dynamics \\\\( M \\\\) and the modified matrix \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Capacitance and resistance properties (C) influence the system's response (R) through the matrix product R = MC, while the Maxwell matrix (M) also directly influences R."
