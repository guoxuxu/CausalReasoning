  "Problem": "The scenario involves the eigenvalue problem in the evolution of a system under transformation. Given a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real matrix, we examine its effects on the dynamics modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the initial complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the evolved state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of the complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation could have mapped multiple initial conditions to a similar final state due to the properties of the exponential map in the complex plane.",
