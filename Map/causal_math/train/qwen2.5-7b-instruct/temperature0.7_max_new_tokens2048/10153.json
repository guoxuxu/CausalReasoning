  "Problem": "Let's consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time in the complex plane. We investigate the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), then let the system evolve according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further changes, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to the evolution without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at the initial time modifies \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from 1 to 1^2=1. However, the nature of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes future values as \\\\( z^2(t) = e^{2it} \\\\), leading to different behavior compared to the unaltered function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which follows the path \\\\( e^{it} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial value z(0) influences z(t) through the function z(t) = e^(it), and z(t) influences z(T) through the same function. Applying g(z) = z^2 to z(0) at t=0 changes z(0) to z'(0) = 1^2 = 1, which is the same as z(0), thus z'(t) = e^(it) and z'(T) = e^(iT) will be equivalent to z(T) if no other changes are made."
