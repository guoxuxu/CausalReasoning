  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a region R with boundary condition specified by \\\\( u(x,0) = x^2 \\\\). The impact of applying a transformation described by multi-dimensional Fourier transform \\\\( F(u(x,y)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,y) e^{-i2\\\\pi xy} dx dy \\\\) on the function is examined.\n\nCan we determine the original boundary conditions \\\\( u(x,0) = x^2 \\\\) after observing the solution at y = Y obtained via the Fourier transform, without knowing the transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Once the Fourier transform modifies the boundary conditions, the resulting solutions do not directly indicate the original state. The transformed conditions obscure the underlying function \\\\( x^2 \\\\), as the Fourier transformation encodes data into a different function space.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
