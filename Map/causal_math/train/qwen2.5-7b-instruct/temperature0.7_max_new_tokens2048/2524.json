  "Problem": "Assume the function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) given by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\). Evaluate results and transformations within the complex plane, specifically considering the impact of modifications by linear transformations represented by complex constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the precise sequence of transformations (original \\\\(z\\\\) and any intermediary transformations like multiplication by \\\\(b\\\\) or \\\\(a\\\\)) used to achieve a given final output, solely by observing that output in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex exponential function's non-linear and periodic properties, and the additional complexity introduced by arbitrary linear transformations such as multiplication by \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\), it's impossible to uniquely backtrack from the output to the sequence of applied transformations without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → f(z); z → b*z; b*z → b*f(z); a → a*z; a*z → a*f(z); f(z) → output",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A complex number z is transformed to f(z) through exponentiation. This can be modified by multiplying z by a complex constant b to get b*f(z), or by multiplying z by another complex constant a to get a*f(z). The final output is determined by these transformations."
