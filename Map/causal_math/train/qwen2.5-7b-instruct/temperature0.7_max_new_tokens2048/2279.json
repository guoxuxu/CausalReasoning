  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the integral transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( e^{-2t} \\\\) and influences the system through the convolution \\\\( y(t) = (f * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{5t} \\\\), will the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the Laplace transform of \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the history of \\\\( x \\\\) leading up to the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) will still be influenced by the values of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\), due to the convolution integral between \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\) that incorporates historical values of \\\\( x \\\\). The Laplace transform of \\\\( f \\\\) does not negate this dependency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) directly influences y(t) through the convolution with f(t), and the Laplace transform of f(t) (denoted as f(s)) determines Y(s). An intervention changing x(t) to e^(5t) after time t_1 will modify y(t) for T > t_1, depending on the current and future values of x(t) rather than its past history."
