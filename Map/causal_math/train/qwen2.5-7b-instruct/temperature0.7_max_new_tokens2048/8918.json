  "Problem": "In the context of continuous-time Markov chains, consider the transition rate matrix Q for a two-state system where state 0 can transition to state 1 and vice versa. Let \\\\(\\\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\\\) be the state-transition matrix used to solve for the probabilities of state occurrences over time t.\n\nCan we determine the precise initial state distribution at t = 0 from the known state probabilities at t = T without knowing if a vector \\\\(v\\\\) modified the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial distribution was modified by \\\\(v\\\\), or knowing the components of \\\\(v\\\\), it's impossible to uniquely reconstruct the exact initial states as multiple combinations of initial conditions and modifications could yield the same probabilities at t = T.",
