  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. Suppose we analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or the nature of the intervention (e.g., the value of \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)) be uniquely determined from the transformed function \\\\( L[\\hat{z}(t)] \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed function \\\\( L[\\hat{z}(t)] \\\\), distinguishing between changes due to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and modifications caused by the intervention requires additional information. The Laplace transform masks the individual effects of time-based changes and interventions, leading to potential ambiguities in identifying specific causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform L[z(t)] depends on the original function z(t) and the complex variable s. The original function z(t) is influenced by time t."
