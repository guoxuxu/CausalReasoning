  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex-valued functions defined in the complex plane and the application of the Laplace transform, which is represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Analyze the behavior and relationships when these functions are subjected to transformations like multiplication by a constant or modification by an exponential decay factor.\n\nGiven a transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{K}{s-a} \\\\) where K is unknown, can we determine the exact scaling factor K and confirm the specific intervention applied only by knowing \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{K}{s-a} \\\\), while it can be deduced that the original function involves \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), the precise value of K cannot be uniquely determined just from the transformed function. Further information about initial conditions or specific values of the function at select points would be needed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
