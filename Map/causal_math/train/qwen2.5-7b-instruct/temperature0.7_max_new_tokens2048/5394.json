  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) representing wave propagation, where c is the wave speed. We explore the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to convert the spatial variable into the frequency domain.\n\nAfter observing the wave at time T in the frequency domain, can we accurately determine the initial waveform \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing whether it was transformed into the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier Transform is a bijective operation, observing the wave in the frequency domain allows for an exact reverse transformation, yielding the initial waveform in the spatial domain regardless of whether the initial transformation was known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
