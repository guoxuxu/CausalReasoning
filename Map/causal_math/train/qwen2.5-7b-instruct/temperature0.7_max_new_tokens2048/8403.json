  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2} h(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given real function. We evaluate scenarios where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is modified by transformations such as \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\).\n\nIf a new transformation, \\\\( g(h)(s) = h(s) - s^2 \\\\), is applied as an intervention partway through the interval, say at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original function \\\\( h(s) \\\\), and not on the transformations \\\\( f(h) \\\\) or \\\\( g(h) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(h) \\\\) changes the form of the integrand by subtracting \\\\( s^2 \\\\) from \\\\( h(s) \\\\). This, along with any potential effects from the initial transformation \\\\( f(h) \\\\), impacts the overall value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent not just on \\\\( h(s) \\\\) but also on the modifications introduced by \\\\( f(h) \\\\) and \\\\( g(h) \\\\).",
