  "Problem": "Consider a physical system whose state at time t is given by the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), and governed by the second order linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{z} + p\\\\dot{z} + qz = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the effect of transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) observed at time T, can we deduce the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), the observed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from different initial conditions altered by the complex exponential. This ambiguity, coupled with the natural evolution of the differential equation, prevents uniquely determining the initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
