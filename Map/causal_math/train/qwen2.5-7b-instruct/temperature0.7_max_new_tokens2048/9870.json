  "Problem": "Investigate the system behavior under the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( b \\\\) is a vector. We study its response when manipulated with the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z + d \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a matrix and \\\\( d \\\\) is a vector, over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is observed, can we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the absence of any transformation other than \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Simply observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not provide enough information to definitely conclude the absence of any other transformation like \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the potential similarity in outcomes resulting from different initial states and transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
