  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the effect of a Laplace Transform applied to this system.\n\nKnowing the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the intervention constants \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The information encapsulated in \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) at time T contains effects of both the initial conditions and the intervention constants. Without additional information about either the initial conditions or the exact form of intervention, it's impossible to uniquely back-calculate the values of \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\). Different interventions can produce similar transforms, making it indeterminate.",
