  "Problem": "Consider a mechanical system where the force \\( F \\) applied to an object causes it to accelerate according to Newton's second law \\( F = ma \\), where \\( m \\) is mass and \\( a \\) is acceleration. Suppose a particular transformation \\( h(a) = k \\cdot a \\) defines a modification to the acceleration, where \\( k \\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nCan we deduce the original acceleration \\( a_0 \\) after observing the final position \\( x(T) \\) without knowing whether \\( h(a) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the scaling transformation \\( h(a) \\), the observed final position \\( x(T) \\) could correspond to multiple initial accelerations depending on the value of \\( k \\). Thus, \\( a_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( x(T) \\) alone.",
