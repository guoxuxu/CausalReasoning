  "Problem": "Consider the process of heat transfer in a one-dimensional metal rod subject to external temperature effects. The change in temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of the rod over time t and position x is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\nGiven only the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we identify if there was an intervention at some time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\) and what that intervention was?",
  "Explanation": "The determination of interventions or precise changes in conditions at some previous point purely from the endpoint data \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) is not feasible. Multiple potential interventions or modifications at \\\\(t_1\\\\) could lead to the same observed endpoint, especially given the heat equation's sensitivity to initial and boundary conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution u(x,t) changes over time due to external temperature effects, and given u(x,T), we can infer past interventions if they led to a change in u(x,t) from t1 to T."
