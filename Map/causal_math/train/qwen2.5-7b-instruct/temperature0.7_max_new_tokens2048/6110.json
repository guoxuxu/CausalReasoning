  "Problem": "Examine a continuous mathematical model using a Fourier transform, where a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) representing a signal is transformed into a frequency domain represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The causal properties of the system are influenced when a filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2} \\\\), with a real constant \\\\( a \\\\), is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) affects the attenuation of the signal's components depending on their frequency.\n\nCan we perfectly recover the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from the filtered signal \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific value of the constant \\\\( a \\\\) used in the filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) requires precise knowledge of the filter characteristics, specifically the constant \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). Without this, the inverse process cannot exactly compensate for the alterations made by the filter in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant a influences the attenuation of signal components, which in turn affects the filtered signal x'(t). The original signal x(t) transforms to X(ω) in the frequency domain, the filter H(ω) modifies X(ω) to X'(ω), and finally X'(ω) transforms back to x'(t) in the time domain. Without knowing the specific value of a, perfect recovery of x(t) from x'(t) is not guaranteed."
