  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We evaluate how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we definitively ascertain which transformations (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied based on the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from various combinations of transformations due to the effects of exponential scalings on the magnitude of \\\\( z \\\\). These transformations can overlap in their impacts, creating ambiguity in back-calculating the exact interventions applied up to time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) is influenced by the initial value of z, the frequency ω, and the transformation parameter α through the relation z(T) = z(0) * exp(iωT) * exp(αT)."
