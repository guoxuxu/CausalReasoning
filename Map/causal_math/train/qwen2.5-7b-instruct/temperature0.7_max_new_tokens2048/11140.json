  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional region. An external source modifies the boundary conditions at specific points through a function represented by \\\\(v(x, y) = e^{i\\\\omega(x+y)}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nBy knowing the internal potential \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine if \\\\(v(x, y)\\\\), \\\\(w(x, y)\\\\), or both were applied on the boundary?",
  "Explanation": "The internal potential \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) does not retain distinct traces of which specific functions were applied at the boundary, especially considering their potential to produce equivalent or overlapping effects within the two-dimensional region governed by the Laplace equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
