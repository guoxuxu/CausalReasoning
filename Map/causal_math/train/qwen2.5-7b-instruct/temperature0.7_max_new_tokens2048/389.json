  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant complex matrix. The evolution of this system is impacted by an integral transform \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Qt} z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex matrix and T is a fixed end time.\n\nIf \\\\( H(z) \\\\) is computed for an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\) without further transformation, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be solely dependent on the initial application of \\\\( H(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The computation of \\\\( H(z) \\\\) is an integral transformation that does not affect the underlying differential evolution described by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\). Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is determined by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{PT} \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), independent of the initial computation of \\\\( H(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) is influenced by the initial application of H(z), which in turn is determined by the integral transform using Q, and z(t) evolves according to P from the initial state z_0."
