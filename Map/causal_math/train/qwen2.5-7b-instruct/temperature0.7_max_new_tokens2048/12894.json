  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a scalar field, and \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant vector. We investigate the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention using another integral transformation, say a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the later state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still behave purely based on the original PDE's characteristics without consideration of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform as an intervention modifies the trajectory of the solution, incorporating effects from both the Fourier and Laplace transforms. This alteration affects the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), making it dependent on interactions from both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "a → ∂u/∂t; u(x, 0) → u(x, t); t_1 → Laplace(u(x, t)); t_1 → Fourier(u(x, 0)); ∂u/∂t + a · ∇u → 0",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in u with respect to time (a → ∂u/∂t) and the gradient of u (a → ∇u) determine the behavior of u according to the PDE. The initial condition u(x, 0) influences u(x, t) over time. Applying a Laplace transform at t_1 affects u(x, t) for T > t_1, whereas applying a Fourier transform only impacts the initial condition u(x, 0). Therefore, the later state u(x, T) depends on both the PDE and the Laplace transform applied at t_1."
