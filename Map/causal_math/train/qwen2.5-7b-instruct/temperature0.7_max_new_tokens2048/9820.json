  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time t according to the integral transform \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with K(s) being a complex kernel function. The initial condition at t = 0 is \\\\(z_0\\\\). An intervention function \\\\(h(t, z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine the exact time \\\\(t_1\\\\) when the intervention was applied, and the specific characteristics of the kernel function K(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of intervention timings and kernel function characteristics due to the complex interactions and transformations over the interval. Hence, these parameters cannot be uniquely identified only from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel function K(s) and the initial condition z(0) directly cause the evolution of z(t) over time t. The intervention function h(t, z) affects z(t). The final state z(T) is determined by the evolution of z(t) up to time T."
