  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, is used to transform the initial condition.\n\nCan we infer the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial state may have been augmented by \\\\( g(x,0) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), altering the evolution path. Without this knowledge, the original state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) cannot be deduced solely from the observation at t=T because possible differences induced by M are unknown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
