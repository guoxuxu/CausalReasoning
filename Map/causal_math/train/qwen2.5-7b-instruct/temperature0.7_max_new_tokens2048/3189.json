  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( t \\) represents time. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\( F(z) \\) which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into its frequency components \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\nIf \\( F(z) \\) is applied to a function \\( z_0(t) \\) and then allowed to proceed without any further transformation, will \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) at \\( \\omega = \\Omega \\) be the same as if \\( z_0(t) \\) was let to evolve naturally without the Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( F(z) \\) transforms \\( z_0(t) \\) from the time domain into the frequency domain, fundamentally shifting its representation. The output \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) at any frequency \\( \\Omega \\) is an inherently different manifestation of the data because it represents frequency components rather than time evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the function z_0(t) over time leads to z(t), which, when subjected to Fourier transformation, results in F(z)(ω). At ω = Ω, F(z)(Ω) represents the frequency component corresponding to frequency Ω of the transformed function."
