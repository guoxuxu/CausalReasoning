  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The intervention is introduced by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied at a specific time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by the system's natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\) without further intervention, does this result in the same end state at t = T as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had only been subjected to its natural evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) initially changes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by altering both its components through C. This transformation can cause the trajectory to deviate significantly, depending on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of M, N, and C, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function h(z) at t=0 influences z(t) for the initial period, then the system evolves naturally under Mx → x(t) and Ny → y(t) from that point onwards, potentially leading to a different end state at t=T compared to natural evolution alone."
