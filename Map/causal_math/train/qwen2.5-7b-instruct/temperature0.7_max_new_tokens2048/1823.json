  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the influence of a Fourier transform on this function as an intervention.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at an intermediate time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the result at time T depend only on the original parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\), and not on the details of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a frequency-domain, potentially introducing new components or modifying existing ones. The state at time T, therefore, not only depends on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) but also significantly on the nature of the Fourier transform applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω and complex constant κ directly influence z(t). Applying a Fourier transform at t_1 influences z(t_1), which then propagates to z(T) through the differential equation."
