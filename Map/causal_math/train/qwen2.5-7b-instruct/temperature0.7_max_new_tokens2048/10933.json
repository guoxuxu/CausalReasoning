  "Problem": "Assuming a signal processing context where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and subsequently passed through an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[x](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t)dt \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) and then transformed by \\\\( T \\\\), will the transform \\\\( T[Lx_0](s) \\\\) be identical to directly transforming \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) using \\\\( T \\\\) and then applying a transformed version of \\\\( L \\\\) in the Laplace domain?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence in which operations are applied matters due to properties of linearity and commutation between operator and integral transform. Applying \\\\( L \\\\) first and then \\\\( T \\\\) may not necessarily commute, which means applying \\\\( T \\\\) first and then transforming \\\\( L \\\\) might yield different results in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear operator L to the signal x_0(t) and then transforming with T results in the same output as transforming x_0(t) first with T and then applying the Laplace transform of L."
