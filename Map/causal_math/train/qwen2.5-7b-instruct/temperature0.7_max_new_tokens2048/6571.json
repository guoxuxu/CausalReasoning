  "Problem": "In a complex function framework, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant, and the implications of further transformations.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention of a second transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Bz \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another non-zero complex constant) is applied, will the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced not only by the initial evolution due to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) but also significantly by the transformations \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Each transformation alters the magnitude and phase, and hence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the compounded effect of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) along with the dynamic evolution under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
