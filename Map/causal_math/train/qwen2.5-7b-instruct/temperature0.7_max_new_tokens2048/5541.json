  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) as matrices. We explore the role of a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that modifies the input \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by the function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( M \\\\) modifies an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the system evolves according to \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), determined by \\\\( L \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved under \\\\( L \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the initial state with \\\\( M \\\\) before applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) changes the starting point, thus affecting the evolution of the system. Since \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\), the impact of the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) influences how the vector sequence progresses, introducing a different trajectory than if \\\\( M \\\\) were not applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation M to the initial state z_0 results in z_1, which then evolves to z(T) under L. Alternatively, z_0 evolves directly to z(T) under L. These two paths do not necessarily yield the same final state z(T)."
