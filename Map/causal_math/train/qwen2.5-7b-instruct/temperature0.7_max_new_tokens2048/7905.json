  "Problem": "Using a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in a dynamical system, analyze its evolution under a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} - az \\\\) with a real constant a. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t) is considered.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( Lz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved under \\\\( Lz \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without applying \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alters the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), changing the initial state by focusing on specific frequencies. When evolved subsequently under \\\\( Lz \\\\), the transformed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will not evolve in the same way as the original would have, displaying different behavior at time T due to modified initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the differential operator L to z(t) determines its evolution over time. Transforming z(t) using the Fourier transform F(z) converts it to the frequency domain Z_freq_domain, which then influences the time-domain representation z(t) when transformed back."
