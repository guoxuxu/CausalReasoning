  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\\\overline{z}\\\\), where A and B are constants and \\\\(\\\\overline{z}\\\\) represents the complex conjugate of z. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is also a constant.\n\nWith the observed final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we necessarily reverse-engineer and identify the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge regarding the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is challenging to backtrack the evolution accurately. The transformation can change the phase and magnitude of the original state in ways that are indistinguishable from effects caused by the complex dynamics of the differential equation alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
