  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its related complex function transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). We examine the impact of these transformations on the integration path in the complex plane.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and integrate along a contour C from point A to B in the complex plane, will the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C g(f(z)) dz \\\\) be the same as integrating \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from A to B directly without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\) modifies the values of the function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) on the integration path, changing the nature of the function being integrated. This leads to a different resulting integral, as the sinusoidal modification significantly alters the integrand.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying g(f(z)) to a complex function f(z) before integration along a contour C changes the integrand, thus the integral ∫_C g(f(z)) dz will generally differ from ∫_C f(z) dz."
