  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem where the velocity field \\\\( v(x, y, t) \\\\) evolves over time according to a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} + (v \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)v = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 v \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. We study the behavior of the velocity field under an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(v) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) denotes the Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( v(x, y, T) \\\\) post-intervention, can we identify precisely which transformations (Laplace, Fourier, or both) were applied throughout the evolution of \\\\( v \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compound effects of applying different transformations like Laplace and Fourier to the velocity field mean that different sequences and combinations of these transformations might yield similar or even identical states at a later time T. The overlapping influences of each transformation make it extremely challenging to uniquely identify which were applied based solely on the observed state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The velocity field v(x, y, t) changes over time due to its own velocity gradient, pressure gradient, and diffusion effects through viscosity. The Laplace transform of v at time T provides information about v's behavior over time."
