  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The effect of the Laplace transform on this function is studied, denoting the transform as \\\\( L\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + e^{i\\\\omega't} \\\\) at some t = t_1, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), say \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\), be just a simple sum of the individual transforms of the original and added components for all s?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the Laplace transform ensures that \\\\( Z'(s) = L\\\\{z(t) + e^{i\\\\omega't}\\\\} = L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} + L\\\\{e^{i\\\\omega't}\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} + \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\), demonstrating that \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) is indeed the sum of the individual transforms.",
