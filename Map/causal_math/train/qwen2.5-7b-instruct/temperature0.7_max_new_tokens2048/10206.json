  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\), where \\\\( f(t) \\) is the original function in the time domain and \\\\( F(s) \\) its image in the complex domain. An intervention is represented by the multiplication of \\\\( F(s) \\) with a complex exponential \\\\( e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nObserving \\\\( L^{-1}\\{ F(s) \\} \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can it be conclusively determined that the transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) originated specifically from \\\\( f(T) \\\\) without external influences?",
  "Explanation": "Given no interventions alter the transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), the direct and reversible relationship between \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) through the Laplace transformation allows a clear determination that \\\\( F(s) \\\\) stems from \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and hence \\\\( f(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function f(t) in the time domain is transformed into F(s) in the complex domain through the Laplace transformation, and the inverse Laplace transformation of F(s) yields the original function f(t) at time T."
