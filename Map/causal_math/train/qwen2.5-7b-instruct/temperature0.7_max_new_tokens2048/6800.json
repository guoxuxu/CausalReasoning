  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebraic scenario where a random initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and then evolves under a linear transformation governed by matrix \\\\( L \\\\), leading to \\\\( z_t = L^t M z_0 \\\\) over discrete time steps \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we determine precisely which matrices were applied (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both) and in what order to the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by just examining the end state \\\\( z_T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying precisely the sequence and type of matrices used on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by only examining \\\\( z_T \\\\) is not feasible without additional information. Both the choice of matrices and their order of application (due to non-commutativity of matrix multiplication) significantly influence the outcome, making it indistinguishable at the end state \\\\( z_T \\\\) which pathway was followed to reach that state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector z_0 is transformed by matrix M and then successively by matrix L over time steps to produce z_T; hence, z_0 → z_T, M → z_T, and L → z_T."
