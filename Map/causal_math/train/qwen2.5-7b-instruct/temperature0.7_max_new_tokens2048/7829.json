  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation describing heat transfer \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We study the impact of applying a Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time t be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) alters the representation of the initial condition into the frequency domain. The heat equation solved in the frequency domain leads to different dynamics compared to the spatial domain solution unless inverse transformed back exactly without any loss of information or modification.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transform to the initial temperature distribution u(x, 0) and allowing it to evolve under the heat equation results in the same temperature profile u(x, t) as directly evolving u(x, 0) under the heat equation."
