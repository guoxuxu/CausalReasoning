  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where x(t) and y(t) follow the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By(t) \\\\) respectively, with A and B being scalar constants. We examine the effect of applying the Laplace transform on these functions, denoted as \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the combined function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some point s, can we uniquely determine x(0) and y(0) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\\\) provides combined information of x and y in the frequency domain. Without additional phase or separation criteria, determining individual x(0) and y(0) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is ambiguous.",
