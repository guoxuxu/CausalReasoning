  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), a complex exponential where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real parameter representing frequency. We inspect the behavior of this function under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) over domain \\\\( x \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( Mz(x) \\\\) (where \\\\( M \\\\) is another complex constant) at some \\\\( x = X \\\\), will \\\\( T(z(X)) \\\\) purely depend on \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), disregarding \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new endpoint \\\\( z(X) \\\\) after intervention by \\\\( M \\\\) still undergoes the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), making the outcome dependent on all parameters \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) involving \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) remains influential in determining the end state alongside the intervention effect from \\\\( M \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformed value T(z(X)) depends on Mz(X) and thus on z(X), M, a, and b. However, when z(X) is modified to Mz(X), T(z(X)) will depend on z(0) only through its initial condition and M, disregarding a and b."
