  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex variable function represented as \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA} ds \\cdot w \\), where A is a constant matrix and w is a constant vector representing initial conditions. Evaluate how the application of a Laplace transform, symbolized by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} \\), affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf we apply a Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any intervention, does this transform fundamentally alter the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t?",
  "Explanation": "Laplace transform, as a linear operator, transforms the function into a different domain (frequency domain) without altering the original time-domain characteristics of the function. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) hence remains unchanged in its original form; what changes is how we represent or analyze it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
