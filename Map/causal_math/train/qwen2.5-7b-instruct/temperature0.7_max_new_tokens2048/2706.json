  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Assume the dynamic of the function is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), with M being a constant 2x2 real matrix.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we exactly establish the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), assuming no information about intermediate transformations (like \\\\( f(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Since the dynamics governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) are linear and the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{MT} \\\\) is invertible for non-singular M, we can uniquely resolve back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) by employing the inverse transformation, \\\\( e^{-MT} z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
