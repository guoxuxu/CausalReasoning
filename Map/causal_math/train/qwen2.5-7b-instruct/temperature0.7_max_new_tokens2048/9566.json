  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We will study the changes in the function with respect to the integration operator over time defined as \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), and analyze the influence of modifications by derivative with respect to time.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) assuming no intervention or transformation was applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) between 0 and T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could potentially yield the same \\\\( F(T) \\\\) due to periodic properties and integral solutions of complex exponentials, thus \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) cannot be unequivocally determined from \\\\( F(T) \\\\) alone without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) directly influences F(t) through integration. The parameter ω directly causes changes in z(t) as it determines the frequency of the exponential function."
