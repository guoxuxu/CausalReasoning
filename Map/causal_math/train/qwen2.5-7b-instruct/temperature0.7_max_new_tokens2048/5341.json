  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is an initial vector. We study the implications of applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) at some point in time t, where E is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf initially at t = 0, the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( x \\\\) and subsequently let to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) without further alterations, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be identical to a scenario where \\\\( x \\\\) was directly subjected to \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by applying \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\) to x, hence changing the trajectory under the dynamics of D. The resulting state at any time T will differ unless E and D have specific relationships that negate the initial effect of E.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(z) at t=0 followed by z(t) results in the same z(T) as directly applying z(t) from t=0 to t=T."
