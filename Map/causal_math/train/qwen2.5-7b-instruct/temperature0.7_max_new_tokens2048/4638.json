  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{(\\\\alpha+i\\\\beta)t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are real numbers governing exponential growth and oscillation, respectively.\n\nGiven the trajectory at t = T, can we conclusively determine if \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Once the transformation has been applied and the system evolves, the scaling and oscillatory effects of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) intertwine with the complex exponential growth due to \\\\(i\\\\omega\\\\), making it impossible to uniquely deduce the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) solely based on the trajectory at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
