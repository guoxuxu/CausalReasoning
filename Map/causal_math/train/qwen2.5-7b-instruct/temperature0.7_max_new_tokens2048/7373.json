  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The transformation specified by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to study the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without any further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any later time t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state of the system by altering its phase and magnitude depending on the structure and coefficients of N. Given that \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) does not necessarily commute with M, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ when it evolves from the transformed initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) applied to the initial condition z_0 at t=0 results in a new function that evolves under the differential equation dz/dt = Mz, which is equivalent to evolving z_0 directly under the same differential equation."
