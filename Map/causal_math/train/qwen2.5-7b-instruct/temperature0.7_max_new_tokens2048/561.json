  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(s-t)A}h(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent function. The transformation \\\\(g(z) = Cz + D\\\\int_0^T z(s) ds\\\\) is applied at time T, where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nIf \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is altered at time t = 0 without further intervention, will the final output of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at T be different?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\(h(t)\\\\) at the outset alters the integrand in the definition of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), and due to the convolution with the matrix exponential, this in turn modifies the entire trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) up to time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
