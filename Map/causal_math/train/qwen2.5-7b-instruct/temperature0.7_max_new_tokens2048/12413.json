  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) on the function u(t).\n\nIf only observing the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) at s = a, can you determine the exact original boundary condition at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides a transformed view of the function that integrates all past changes but does not explicitly distinguish how these changes occurred initially (e.g., specific boundary conditions). Thus, exact details of original conditions cannot be uniquely deduced from the transformed function alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
