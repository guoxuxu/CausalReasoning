  "Problem": "Consider a function on a complex plane governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^{2} \\\\) affects the output when applied at different instances.\n\nConsidering a known final result of \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) and knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we determine whether transformations such as \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\) (or both) were applied during the interval? ",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of non-linear (squared) and linear (shift) transformations under an exponential mapping result in multiple potential precursor states which could lead to a given endpoint. This results in a fundamental ambiguity in inferring the specific path or sequence of transformations purely based on final complex function values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
