  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore how the system behaves under different conditions when applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(t) = t^2 x(t)\\\\) and assessing the impact of this change across various scenarios.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) be accurately determined from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(s)\\\\) without any prior information about whether the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was applied, reconstructing \\\\(x(t)\\\\) from \\\\(H(s)\\\\) is not possible since the polynomial multiplication affects the poles and zeroes of the resulting transform, leading to ambiguity and loss of information about the original form of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
