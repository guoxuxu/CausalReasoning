  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore how different transformations influence this function, specifically transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different times.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the application of either \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\), \\\\( T_2(z) \\\\), or both, simply by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is difficult because multiple transformation sequences can lead to the same or similar outputs, particularly due to the complex nature of exponential and polynomial manipulations in the complex plane. The non-linearity and superposition of effects create ambiguities in reverse-engineering the initial transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
