  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution u(x,t) across a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( g(u) = \\\\int_0^L e^{-ax} u(x,t) dx \\\\), where a is a constant and L is the length of the rod.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( g(u(t)) \\\\) at time t = T without knowing the initial functional form of u?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) integrates out certain spatial features due to the exponential weighting, resulting in a loss of information about the original distribution. Without additional boundary conditions or initial data, the original distribution u(x,0) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( g(u(t)) \\\\).",
