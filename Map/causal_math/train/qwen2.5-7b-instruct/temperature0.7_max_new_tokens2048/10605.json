  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. The function describes the combined influence of two transformations on initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) begins with initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) without any intervention, will the outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\) be solely determined by the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the future state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is directly determined by \\\\( e^{AT}x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}y_0 \\\\). Since there's no intervention altering the terms, the role of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) in transforming their respective vectors dictates the state completely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A and B determine z(T), which is influenced by the initial vectors x_0 and y_0."
