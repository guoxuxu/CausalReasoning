  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine the changes introduced by performing a Laplace transformation on \\( z(t) \\), denoted as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\).\n\nIf at a time \\( t_1 \\) an intervention is applied wherein \\( z(t) \\) is multiplied by \\( e^{at} \\) (where \\( a \\) is a constant), will the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\) at any \\( s \\) be dependent only on \\( i\\omega \\) and not on \\( a \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention inherently changes the evolution of \\( z(t) \\), and thus the corresponding Laplace transformation will involve terms dependent on both \\( a \\) and \\( i\\omega \\). The multiplication by \\( e^{at} \\) before taking the transformation affects the coefficients and the nature of the exponential terms in \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of z(t) depends on iω but not on a. The change in z(t) due to multiplication by e^(at) affects z(t) directly, which in turn influences its Laplace transform L{z}(s), but this influence is independent of the value of a."
