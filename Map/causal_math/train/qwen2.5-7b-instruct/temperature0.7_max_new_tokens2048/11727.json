  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variable t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x \\\\). We examine modifications introduced by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) before T, another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the initial equations without considering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after \\\\( f(z) \\\\) effectively introduces opposite rotations at different times, influencing the trajectory and potentially undoing or altering the effects of the initial transformation at specific instances. Consequently, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the interplay between both transformations and their frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), alongside the path dictated by the original differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "x(t) and y(t) directly determine z(t). Applying f(z) and then g(z) with opposite phases cancels each other out, leaving z(t) unchanged in terms of its form but potentially altered in value due to the transformations. Therefore, the final state z(T) depends on the initial equations for x(t) and y(t), independent of omega in f(z) and g(z)."
