  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation representing the rate of change in the electrical potential V across a capacitor in an RC circuit, given by \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V \\\\). A step function intervention via a voltage source modifies the potential by adding a function \\\\( h(t) = He^{Dt} \\\\), where H, D are constants and t is time.\n\nGiven the known final voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely deduce whether interventions \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or both, were applied, based only on the end condition?",
  "Explanation": "The final voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) could result from varying combinations of initial conditions and interventions \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or other unknown factors. The overlapping effects of different transformations, along with their parameters, make it difficult to accurately distinguish the interventions used just from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
