  "Problem": "Assess a dynamic system governed by partial differential equation \\\\(u_{xx} + u_{yy} + \\lambda u = 0\\\\) defined over a domain \\\\(D\\\\) with boundary conditions. Consider an integral transform \\\\(T(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\lambda xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) and its impact on the solution \\\\(u\\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new transformation \\\\(S(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\mu xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) is applied at a certain point \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the system's state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the original equation parameters without depending on the transformations \\\\(T\\\\) or \\\\(S\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions using transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and subsequently \\\\(S\\\\) significantly alter the trajectory and final state of the system. The state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) will be influenced by the initial application of \\\\(T\\\\) and later by \\\\(S\\\\), in addition to the inherent dynamics dictated by the partial differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The second-order partial derivatives u_{xx} and u_{yy}, along with the parameter λ, directly cause the function u. The variables x and y also directly cause u. The integral transforms T(u) and S do not directly cause u but influence the state u(T) indirectly through their parameters and the function u. The parameter t_1 influences the time point T, which in turn influences the state u(T)."
