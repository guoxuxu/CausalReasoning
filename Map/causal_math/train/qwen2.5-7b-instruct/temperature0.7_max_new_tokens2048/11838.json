  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane as \\(z(t) = e^{At}z_0\\), where \\(A\\) is a complex constant and \\(z_0\\) is the initial complex value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation given by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\) on the system, where \\(B\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_{t_1}^Te^{Cs}z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\(C\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( I(z) \\) introduces additional dynamics that influence the behavior of the system post-\\( t_1 \\). The final state \\( z(T) \\) will be affected by the initial transformation \\( T(z) \\) as well as the subsequent intervention \\( I(z) \\), making it dependent on \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

The endpoint z(T) depends on the initial value z(0), the constant A, and the intervention times t1 and T, but not directly on B or C after the initial transformation T(z)."
