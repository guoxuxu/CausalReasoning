  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We analyze the effect of complex conjugation on this function and any potential impacts on integral transformations of the resulting function over time t.\n\nGiven the final output from a Fourier transform at t = T, can we determine unambiguously whether the operation \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) at a specific point was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Frequency and phase characteristics at the output of a Fourier transform could result from various combinations of the initial function and mid-process interventions. Especially since complex exponentials can alter the phase significantly, it is impossible to backtrack uniquely and determine the exact interventions from the Fourier transform results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of complex conjugation on \\( e^{iz} \\) does not uniquely determine the original function without additional information, as \\( e^{i\\overline{z}} \\) and \\( e^{iz} \\) can yield similar Fourier transform outputs depending on the specific values of z."
