  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a starting complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) naturally, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t > 0 be equivalent to what it would have been by direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial value of the state from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{k \\\\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as time progresses, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) includes the effect of \\\\( k \\\\) due to the multiplicative factor \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), which changes the trajectory compared to the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) directly causes the state z(t) through the differential equation evolution, while the transformation f(z) directly causes z(t) at any time t > 0. However, applying f(z) followed by the differential equation does not necessarily result in the same state as directly evolving z(0) without transformation."
