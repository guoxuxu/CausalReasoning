  "Problem": "Consider a functional system governed by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the alterations in system behavior by introducing an external control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) that modifies the integral operation.\n\nCan the value of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be precisely determined if we observe only the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at some \\\\( z \\\\) without knowing the form or the parameters of \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), it is impossible to reverse-engineer the value of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) due to the potential complexity and non-invertibility of the integral of \\\\( e^{t^2} \\\\).",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
