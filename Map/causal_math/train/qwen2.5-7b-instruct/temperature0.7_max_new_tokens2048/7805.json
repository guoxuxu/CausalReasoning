  "Problem": "Consider a complex function transformation of a vector space, where we use the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by the operation \\\\( L(z) = pz + q \\\\) for complex scalars \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\). We investigate how the transformation impacts the solutions of the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the vector is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by applying a linear operation \\\\( pz + q \\\\). This changes the trajectory such that the evolved \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) starting from \\\\( pz_0 + q \\\\) will differently evolve compared to starting directly from \\\\( z_0 \\\\), altering the resulting state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation L(z_0) results in z(t), which evolves under Mz to produce dz/dt; directly evolving z_0 under Mz also results in z(t) at time T."
