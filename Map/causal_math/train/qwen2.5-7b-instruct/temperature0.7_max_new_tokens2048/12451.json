  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nCan we precisely identify the nature of the intervention \\( Q(D) \\) applied at \\( t_1 \\) by analyzing \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at \\( T \\), knowing only the initial operator \\( P(D) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple potential interventions \\( Q(D) \\) could lead to equivalent modifications in \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\), especially if \\( P(D) \\) and \\( Q(D) \\) are not uniquely distinguishable in their effect on the frequency spectrum. Without additional information, it is impossible to unambiguously determine which \\( Q(D) \\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial operator P(D) directly influences z(t), and at time t_1, an intervention Q(D) is applied to z(t). The Fourier transformation F transforms z(t) into the frequency domain, and we can observe F(z(T)) at time T to understand the effects of both P(D) and Q(D)."
