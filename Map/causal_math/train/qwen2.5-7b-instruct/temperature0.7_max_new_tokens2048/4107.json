  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We examine the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another complex constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B, not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new factor influencing the trajectory of the system, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on A and B but also significantly on C and D. The manner in which the transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) interact with the original system dynamics alters the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
