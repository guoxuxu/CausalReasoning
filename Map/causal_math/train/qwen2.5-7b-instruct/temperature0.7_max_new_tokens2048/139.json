  "Problem": "Consider a vector field given by \\\\( v(z) = iz \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transformation of the form \\\\( f(z) = \\int_{\\gamma} e^{zt} dz \\\\), where \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, is applied to this vector field over time t.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\int_{\\delta} e^{zt} dz \\\\) (where \\\\( \\delta \\\\) is another contour) is applied, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original field dynamics and not by \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) or \\\\( \\delta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional modifications which also depend on its respective contour and the nature of e^{zt}. This will alter the behavior and final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making the endpoint dependent on \\\\( \\gamma \\\\), \\\\( \\delta \\\\), and the field's own dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The vector field v(z) influences z(T) through the integral transformation f(z), and the second integral transformation g(z) influences z(T) independently."
