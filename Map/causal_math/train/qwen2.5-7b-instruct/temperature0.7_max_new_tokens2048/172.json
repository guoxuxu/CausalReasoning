  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{Y(s)}{s - P} \\\\), where \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of the output variable y(t) and P is a constant pole. An input function is defined as \\\\( u(t) = e^{Dt} \\\\) where D is a constant. The system's response is altered by applying the Laplace transform of the input.\n\nGiven the computed response \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at some time t, can we decisively conclude whether the initial input was \\\\( u(t) \\\\), the intervention \\\\( v(t) \\\\), or both, by only examining the value of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact input sequence (\\\\( u(t) \\\\), \\\\( v(t) \\\\), or both) solely from the final state \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) might be unfeasible due to the convolution properties of Laplace transforms and the overlap of their effects in altering system response. The computations involved do not allow for an unambiguous back-calculation of the input types based on the observed output alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
