  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x(t) and y(t) are real functions governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), with A, B, C, D being constants, and u a control input. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to the function z(t).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing the differential equations, can we determine if any intervention, like the function v(t), was used, solely based on the data of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given just the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the original equations, it is challenging to distinguish whether the system evolved naturally or was influenced by an intervention such as v(t). The final state could occur under multiple scenarios, making it impossible to deduce the presence of specific interventions like v(t) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention v(t) can influence the control input u, which in turn directly affects both x(t) and y(t). Given the differential equations and the endpoint z(T), we cannot solely determine if an intervention v(t) was used without additional information."
