  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. This setup is used to analyze the interaction between the two exponential terms over time.\n\nIf the resultant complex function value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is known, can one uniquely identify the original vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) without prior knowledge of their involvement?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) because the contributions from \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}y \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can overlap, allowing multiple potential combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) that could result in the same observed outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
