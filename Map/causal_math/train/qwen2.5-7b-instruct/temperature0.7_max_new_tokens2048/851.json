  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z(t) \\), respectively. The Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} \\) is used to analyze the system behavior in the s-domain.\n\nIf a modification is applied to the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} \\), such as an addition of a pole or zero, and then the inverse transform is applied, will the resulting function directly reflect only the original \\( z(t) \\) without the influence of the modification?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the Laplace Transform, such as by adding a pole or zero, introduces changes that affect the behavior and characteristics of the resultant time-domain function when the inverse transform is applied. This results in a new function that includes the effects of the original \\( z(t) \\) along with modifications imposed in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
