  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\(z = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator, representing the transformation matrix. We explore the effects of applying a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) under transformation \\\\(z = Lx_0\\\\), and no further operations perform, does \\\\(z(T)\\\\) only depend on \\\\(Lx_0\\\\) without influence from \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) when applied modifies the transformed state through the effect of the exponential of a complex function, thus introducing dependency on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) that alters the resulting vector through changes in phase or amplitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T (z(T)) depends directly on Lx_0 and indirectly through the function f(z) which includes ω, but ω does not directly affect z(T) without going through f(z)."
