  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a circular path in the complex plane at a fixed radius of 1, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We examine the change in trajectory when this function is altered with a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t.\n\nIf an intervention squaring the function is applied at a certain time t1, will the trajectory from t1 to T be independent of the initial angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "After the intervention at t1, the new function becomes \\\\( (e^{i\\omega t_1})^2 e^{i\\omega (t-t_1)} \\\\), which depends on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The angular frequency and trajectory up to t1 play a crucial role in determining the trajectory from t1 to T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) = z^2 at time t1 directly changes z(t) from its original form, making the trajectory from t1 to T dependent on the initial z(t) but not directly on the initial angular frequency ω, since ω's effect is removed by the squaring operation."
