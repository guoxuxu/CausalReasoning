  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The response of the system to inputs is investigated under the influence of a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), with K being another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will the result \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to what would be obtained if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) had not undergone transformation and was simply evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the initial state via the exponential matrix \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\), which potentially modifies the eigenstructure of the initial vector relative to D. This results in a trajectory that diverges from that of the untransformed system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation h(x) to x_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) results in x(t) which is equivalent to evolving x_0 directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without transformation."
