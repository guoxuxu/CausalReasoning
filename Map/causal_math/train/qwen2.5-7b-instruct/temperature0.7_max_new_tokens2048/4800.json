  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{j\\omega t} x(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) is a time-dependent input signal and \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. The dynamics of \\( x(t) \\) in the system are described by a complex function \\( x(t+1) = L x(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear transformation.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\( z(t) \\), \\( q(t) \\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) could result from different combinations or sequences of transformations due to the interplay of complex exponential terms and the linear dynamics. Various combinations of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\) could lead to the same observed endpoint \\( z(T) \\), making it impossible to uniquely identify the specific interventions made without further information.",
