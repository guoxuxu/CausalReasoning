  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Cu\\\\), where C is a linear operator. We further explore the role of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ds}u(s) ds \\\\) where D is another linear operator.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) over an interval [0, t], and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Cu\\\\) till T, will \\\\( u(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Cu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the function by integrating a transformed version of it, hence changing its response to the operator C over time. This results in a different \\\\( u(T) \\\\) compared to direct evolution from \\\\( u_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation T to u_0 before evolving it with \\(\\dot{u} = Cu\\) results in the same u(T) as directly evolving u_0 with \\(\\dot{u} = Cu\\) for the same duration."
