  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u, denoted as \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))(s)\\\\), on the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a different transformation, say Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), is introduced at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final representation \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,T)\\\\) depend only on L and not on the initial Fourier or later Laplace transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention introduces another layer of complexity in the system. The final state in the frequency domain not only depends on the operator L but also heavily on the initial and intermediary transformations. Each transformation affects the resultant state through its unique alteration of the domain or characteristic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
