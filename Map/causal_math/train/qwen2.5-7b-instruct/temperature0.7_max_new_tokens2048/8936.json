  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a continuous function. The transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) is explored, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing \\\\( H(s) = F(s - a - c) \\\\), can we explicitly determine the individual values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) without knowledge of initial applications?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting expression \\\\( H(s) = F(s - a - c) \\\\) alone does not provide information to uniquely separate or determine the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) independently. The shift in domain is cumulatively seen as \\\\( s - a - c \\\\), and without other constraints or initial conditions, their individual determination isn’t feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(t) → H(s) and F(s) → H(s) indicates that H(s) is derived from both g(t) and F(s). Additionally, a → H(s) and c → H(s) suggest that the constants a and c directly influence H(s)."
