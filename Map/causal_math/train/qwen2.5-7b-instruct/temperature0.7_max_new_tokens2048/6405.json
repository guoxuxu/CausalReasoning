  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t} z \\\\) is applied over time t, with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant. The system operates under the function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z'(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by rotating the complex number. This rotation alters the trajectory since the subsequent evolution magnifies these changes exponentially, resulting in a different end value at any \\\\( T > 0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "At time T > 0, the transformation T(z) causes z(T) through the application of \\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\) to z_0, while z'(t) causes z(T) through the application of \\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\) to z_0. Both transformations start from z_0 at t = 0, but the resulting z(T) will differ unless \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\lambda \\\\)."
