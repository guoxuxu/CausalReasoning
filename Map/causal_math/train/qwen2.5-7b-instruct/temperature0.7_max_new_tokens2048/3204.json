  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider the modification of the initial temperature distribution by the function \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\), can one determine which modifications (\\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "After substantial time evolution under the diffusion process, distinguishing the effects of the sine and cosine modifications on the initial and intermediate states can be challenging. The overlapping influences of both functions make it impossible to identify with certainty which modifications were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
