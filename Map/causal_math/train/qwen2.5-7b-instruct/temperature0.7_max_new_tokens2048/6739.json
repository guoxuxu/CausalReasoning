  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous system handling electric current \\( I(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dI}{dt} = -kI \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. Consider an intervention represented by the function \\( f(I) = AI^2 \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant. This study determines the impact of transformation \\( f \\) over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new linear boost \\( g(I) = CI + D \\) (where \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( I(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( k \\) and not on \\( A \\), \\( C \\), or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( I(T) \\) will depend on all constants \\( A \\), \\( C \\), \\( D \\), as well as \\( k \\). The intervention with \\( g(I) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces additional modifications influencing the trajectory, making \\( I(T) \\) a result of a compounded effect of both transformations and the natural decay governed by \\( k \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of current I(t) depends on the constant k. The function f(I) and g(I) represent interventions that do not affect the fundamental decay rate determined by k."
