  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We analyze how the integral transformation \\\\(X(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, influences the state over time.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\(X(t)\\\\) is executed starting from \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 and evolves according to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), will the function \\\\(X(T)\\\\) be the same as having applied \\\\(X(t)\\\\) under the dynamics \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) for all \\\\(t\\\\) without additional influences?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(X(t)\\\\) depends not only on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) but also on the interplay between the matrices \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). Since \\\\(X(t)\\\\) incorporates the entire history of \\\\(z(s)\\\\) up to time \\\\(t\\\\), modified by \\\\(B\\\\), its final value at \\\\(T\\\\) will differ when the system's history is altered by \\\\(B\\\\).",
