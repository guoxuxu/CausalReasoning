  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We analyze the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, applied to the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nIf an additional boundary modification represented by another integral transform (say, Laplace transform) is applied as an intervention, will the solution to Laplace’s equation in the domain depend only on the original boundary conditions without consideration of the transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with another integral transform affects the boundary conditions further, creating a composite effect on the boundary input to the domain. The resulting potential function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) depends on both the Fourier and any subsequent transform applied, thus influencing the final solution within the domain under Laplace’s equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying an additional boundary modification through an integral transform (such as Laplace transform) can change the solution dependence on the original boundary conditions, while the original boundary conditions still directly influence the solution to Laplace's equation."
