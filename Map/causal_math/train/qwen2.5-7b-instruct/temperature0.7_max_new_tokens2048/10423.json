  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\,dt\\\\) on this system.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by altering \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the Laplace transform of the resultant function only depend on the new \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) and not on the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the frequency component \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the system but does not negate historical data influenced by the previous \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). The Laplace transform of the resultant function will reflect contributions from both the original and altered frequencies, indicating dependency on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\(z(t)\\) depends on \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega'\\). The change in \\(\\omega\\) to \\(\\omega'\\) at time \\(t_1\\) affects \\(z(t)\\) from that point onward, but the Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\) will primarily reflect the influence of \\(\\omega'\\) after \\(t_1\\), assuming \\(\\omega\\) remains unchanged before \\(t_1\\)."
