  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt \\\\), a Laplace transform operating on a function w(t). We explore changes induced by modifying w(t) either through a polynomial scaling \\\\( p(t) = t^n \\\\) or an exponential modifier \\\\( q(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the transformed function z(w'')(s) from an intervention that either applied p(t) or q(t) or both, can we deduce precisely what modifications were made only based on z(w'')(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed result z(w'')(s) can be influenced by either p(t), q(t), or a combination of both, affecting it in overlapping ways. The resulting Laplace transform will not provide clear indications as to which transformations or combinations of transformations were applied, especially due to the integration and overlapping effects in the exponential and polynomial terms.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
