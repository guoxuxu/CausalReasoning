  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = -v \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = u + \\\\alpha v \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant. We also consider the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an impulse \\\\( \\\\delta(t - t_1) \\\\) is added to \\\\( u(t) \\\\), will the endpoint Laplace transform \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original differential equations and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the impulse modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting the subsequent evolution of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) under their differential equations. This change will be reflected in the Laplace transform of the function at any later time T, making the resultant transform dependent on the nature and timing of the intervention as well as the original dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An impulse δ(t - t₁) directly causes a change in u(t), which then influences u'(t) and v(t); v(t)'s changes propagate to v'(t); the Laplace transform L(z(t)) at time T depends on the updated values of u(t) and v(t) due to the impulse."
