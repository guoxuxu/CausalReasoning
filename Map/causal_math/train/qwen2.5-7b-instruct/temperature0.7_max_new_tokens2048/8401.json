  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2} h(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given real function. We evaluate scenarios where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is modified by transformations such as \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(h) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) initially, then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is computed via the integral transform without further changes to function \\\\( h(s) \\\\), will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( h(s) \\\\) was used directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\) alters the integrand in the integral transform, thereby changing the resulting function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The addition of \\\\( s^3 \\\\) to \\\\( h(s) \\\\) will contribute to the integral value differently, leading to a different function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) than what would emerge using unmodified \\\\( h(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 to h(s) results in a different z(t) than using h(s) directly because the integral includes the additional s^3 term."
