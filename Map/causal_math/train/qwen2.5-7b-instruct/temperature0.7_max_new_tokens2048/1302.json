  "Problem": "Analyze the causal effects in a linear control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and u represents a control input. The impact of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Exp(Dt)x \\\\) over time t, where D is another constant matrix, is considered.\n\nIs it possible to accurately determine the initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, if it's unknown whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information on whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was used introduces uncertainty about initial conditions, making it impossible to reliably backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The potential transformation by \\\\( Exp(Dt) \\\\) means multiple initial states could converge to the same observed state at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
