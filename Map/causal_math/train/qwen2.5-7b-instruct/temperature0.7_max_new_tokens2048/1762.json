  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, under the application of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). We analyze how interventions by multiplication of a complex exponential factor affect causal inference in this complex waveform scenario.\n\nCan the original value of \\\\( w \\\\) be uniquely determined from the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) in the s-domain without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-iw} \\\\), from which the original frequency \\\\( w \\\\) can be directly recovered by inspecting the imaginary part of the pole in the s-domain. The recovery of \\\\( w \\\\) is unique and clear.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original value of w influences z(t), which in turn affects the transformed function L(z(t)); however, L(z(t)) alone does not uniquely determine w without additional information."
