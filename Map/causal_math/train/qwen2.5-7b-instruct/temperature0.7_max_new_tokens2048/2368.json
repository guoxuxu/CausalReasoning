  "Problem": "Analyze the causal relationship in a matrix-based system with the equation \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(t) = P\\\\textbf{x}_0 + tQ\\\\textbf{x}_0\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\) are constant matrices. We consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x}) = e^{Rt}\\\\textbf{x}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) is another constant matrix, at various points in time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(T)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely identify the specific matrix transformations used (whether \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\), \\\\(h(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\), or both) solely by knowing the matrix \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of applying \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\) and \\\\(h(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\) at various times could produce the same endpoint \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(T)\\\\). The overlap in potential trajectories and effects introduced by each matrix exponential transformation makes it impractical to uniquely reverse engineer which interventions occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrices P and Q determine the initial state and the effect of time t on the state vector x(t). The matrix R influences the transformation g(x) applied at time T, which then determines the state vector x(T)."
