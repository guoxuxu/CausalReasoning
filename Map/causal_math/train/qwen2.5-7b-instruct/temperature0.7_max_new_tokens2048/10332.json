  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. Consider a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-iwx} u(x) dx\\\\) being applied as a transformation.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution at time T, \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\), can one unequivocally determine whether a Fourier transform was applied at any earlier time and, if so, exactly when?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting temperature distribution \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) could be similar from several different Fourier-modified and non-modified initial or intermediate states due to the general solution form and overlapping effects of the heat equation dynamics. Hence, it's impossible to definitively ascertain the presence or timing of a Fourier intervention solely from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
