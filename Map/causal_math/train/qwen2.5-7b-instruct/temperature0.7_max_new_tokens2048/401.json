  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system's behavior is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Kx}u \\\\), where K is a constant matrix and x represents spatial coordinates.\n\nIf \\\\( h(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at x = 0, and then allowed to propagate under \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at x = X and t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to (X, T) under \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(u) \\\\) changes the initial spatial profile of the function by modifying its structure through \\\\( e^{Kx} \\\\). The evolution of this transformed initial condition under L will then follow a different pathway compared to the direct evolution of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under the same operator, resulting in a different state at (X,T).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(u) applied to u_0 at x=0 results in a modified initial condition that propagates under the operator L to produce u(x,t), which may differ from the direct evolution of u_0 under L to (x,t). The matrix K influences the transformation h(u) but does not directly cause changes in u(x,t) through L."
