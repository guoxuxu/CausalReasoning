  "Problem": "Consider a system under a linear transformation described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform essentially encodes the time function into the frequency domain, integrating over all time. Information about specific point-in-time behaviors without knowing the transformation history (i.e., whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was or was not applied) makes it unfeasible to accurately trace back to the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform F(z) to z(t) results in z'(t), but without knowledge of F(z) or M, deducing z_0(t) at t=0 from z'(t) at t=T is not possible."
