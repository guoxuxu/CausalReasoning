  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system with a controlled function \\\\(F(x, u) = A x + B u\\\\), where x is the state vector, u is the control input, A is the state matrix, and B is the control matrix. We are interested in the impact of a perturbation transformation \\\\(h(x) = Cx\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on the evolution of the state vector over time under the control strategy that minimizes a quadratic cost function.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can the exact sequence and nature of interventions, including the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and any adjustments with \\\\( K \\\\), be uniquely determined by observing only \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of initial perturbations and control strategy adjustments, especially if the matrices do not have unique or distinguishable effects. The influence of multiple matrices and control alterations leads to non-uniqueness in identifying the exact history of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the perturbation transformation h(x) directly influences the end state x(T); the function F(x, u) determines the evolution of the state vector x(T) over time; the gain matrix K is used to adjust the control input u which in turn affects x(T)."
