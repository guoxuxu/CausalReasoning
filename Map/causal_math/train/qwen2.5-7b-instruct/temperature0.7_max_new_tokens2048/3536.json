  "Problem": "Investigate a heat distribution system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\(k\\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial temperature distribution function, \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at some time T > t, can the specific transformations (either \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(u)\\\\) or both) used be precisely identified based on the distribution observed?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\) transformations alter the system in significantly overlapping ways and the diffusion process further entangles the effects, reverse engineering the precise transformations from \\\\\\end distribution alone is ambiguous without additional constraints or information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x, 0) influences the temperature distribution u(x, T) through Fourier transformation F, resulting in frequency domain representation U(k, ξ, 0) which then evolves over time to U(k, ξ, T). The transformed distribution U(k, ξ, T) can be further processed by another transformation G to produce G(U(k, ξ, T))."
