  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. We introduce the transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) where M is another constant matrix, to study how this affects the trajectories over time t.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we unambiguously trace back to the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, it's not possible to uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) could have altered the initial state in ways that are not retrievable merely by observing the terminal state under the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The trajectory x(t) at time t depends on the initial state x_0. The transformation g(x) depends on the matrix M. The dynamics of x(t) are governed by the matrix D."
