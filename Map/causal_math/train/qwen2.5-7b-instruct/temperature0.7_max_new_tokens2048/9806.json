  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex-valued differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau}z d\\\\tau \\\\) over time t, where B is a real constant matrix that generally does not commute with A.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), can we infer the exact original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the state at t = T without information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) means that the original condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) might have been modified initially by the transformation, which potentially cannot be undone or inferred accurately due to the non-commutativity of exponentials of B and A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(t) at time t is influenced by the initial state z_0, which is caused by the constant matrix A through the differential equation. The integral transformation g(z) involving matrix B affects z(t), and this transformation can be traced back to influence the original state z_0."
