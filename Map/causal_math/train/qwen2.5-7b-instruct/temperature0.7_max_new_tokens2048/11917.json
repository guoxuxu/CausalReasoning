  "Problem": "In a physics experiment, a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) is modeled using the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a Hamiltonian operator. We run simulations using an initial condition \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) modified by a function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) representing a constant wave number.\n\nCan we determine the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine if the observed \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) resulted from an evolved \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) or from an evolved \\\\( f(\\\\psi_0(x)) \\\\) due to the phase shift introduced by \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
