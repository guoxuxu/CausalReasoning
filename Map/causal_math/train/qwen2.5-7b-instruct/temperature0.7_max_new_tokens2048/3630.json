  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic form described by \\\\( Q(x) = x^T A x \\\\), where A is a symmetric matrix. We analyze the behavior of this form under a linear transformation defined by the matrix T over the vector space.\n\nCan one determine the original vector x after observing the value of \\\\( Q(Tx) \\\\), given the transformed A, without knowing the transformation T?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of T, it's impossible to reconstruct the original vector x uniquely from the quadratic form value in the transformed space because different vectors can yield the same quadratic form after transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
