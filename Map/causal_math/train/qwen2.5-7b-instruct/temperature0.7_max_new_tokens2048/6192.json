  "Problem": "Consider the analytical solution of the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) under initial conditions that can be represented as a Fourier transform. An operation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) based only on knowing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the heat equation presents additive linearity and diffusive effects, smoothing out distinct features over time. Multiple different combinations of initial conditions and interventions can lead to similar or identical temperature profiles at time T, especially when they involve sinusoidal components that could interfere or blend in a non-distinguishable manner due to the inherent properties of the heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in temperature over time (u_t) directly causes the second derivative of temperature with respect to position (u_xx). The operation f(u) transforms the temperature profile (u) into a new profile (u_new), and knowing the temperature profile at time T (u(x,T)) allows us to determine the transformed profile (u_new)."
