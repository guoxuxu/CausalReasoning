  "Problem": "Assess the relations within a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diagonalizable constant matrix. We explore interventions and transformations mediated through the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the system at time T, can we precisely deduce the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was used, it's unclear if the observed state stems from \\\\( e^{DT}x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{DT}Mx_0 \\\\). The potential application of \\\\( M \\\\) can significantly mask or change the original \\\\( x_0 \\\\), complicating trace-back.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of x at time t is influenced by the matrix D and time t. The value of z(t) is determined by the product of D and x at time t. The function h(x) depends on the matrix M and the input x. Knowing z(T) does not allow us to precisely deduce x_0 without information about whether h(x) was applied."
