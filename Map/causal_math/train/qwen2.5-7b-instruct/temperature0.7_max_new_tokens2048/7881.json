  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), to the function u(t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and then u(t) evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the Fourier transform was not applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform at t = 0 is a linear and reversible operation that does not alter the behavior of the solution u(t) under the differential operator L. The evolution of u(t) solely depends on L, regardless of the initial Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to u(t) at t=0 and then letting u(t) evolve under the PDE \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\) will result in u(T) being different from evolving u(t) without applying the Fourier transform."
