  "Problem": "Analyze causal behavior in a system undergoing Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Scenario dives into whether the performance and predictions of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems governed by convolution integrals \\\\( (f * g)(t) = \\\\int_0^t f(\\\\tau) g(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) can be inferred or influenced by certain transformation functions.\n\nIf a third function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), acting as an additional system influence, is introduced at a certain time before computing the final Laplace transformation, does the system's ultimate output rely strictly on the original functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or does \\\\( h(t) \\\\) also have a determinant effect?",
  "Explanation": "The inclusion of the third function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) as either an additional input or another system characteristic would alter the convolution function leading to a final output, therefore affecting the overall system response. The output depends on \\\\( h(t) \\\\) in addition to the original constituents by altering signal pathways or system responses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
