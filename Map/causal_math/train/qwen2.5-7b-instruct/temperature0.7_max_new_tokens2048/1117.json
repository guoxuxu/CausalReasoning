  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a Holomorphic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane. The integral transformation is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is multiplied by a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) at t = 0 (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a non-zero constant), and then allowed to evolve and be transformed as \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformation result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) simply be scaled by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) simply scales the entire integral by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) because the linearity of the integral guarantees that \\\\( \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} \\\\alpha z(t) dt = \\\\alpha \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt = \\\\alpha Z(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying z(t) by a constant α at t=0 directly scales Z(s) by α, and z(t)'s value at t=0 indirectly influences Z(s) through the integral transformation."
