  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nGiven the final transformation result, can we conclusively determine the sequence of functions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) then \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or their combinations) used, by just knowing the output?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the exponential function's periodic nature and the squaring transformation's effect on amplitude and phase, the same output could potentially be obtained from multiple different sequences of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). This ambiguity prevents a definitive back-calculation of the operations or their order.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying f(z) = e^(iz) to a complex number z results in a new value, which is then transformed by g(z) = z^2, or vice versa, depending on the sequence of application."
