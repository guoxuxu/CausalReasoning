  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Stokes' theorem in a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\) over a manifold. The theorem states \\\\( \\\\int_{\\\\partial M} \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\int_M (\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}) \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\). We explore how applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{F}(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} \\\\mathbf{F}(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) affects the relationship outlined by Stokes' theorem.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{F}(t)) \\\\) is applied to the vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\) and this transformed field evolves on manifold \\\\( M \\\\) without further intervention, does the relationship described by Stokes' theorem still hold?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform changes the nature of the vector field from a time-varying field to an s-domain representation which fundamentally alters the calculation and interpretation of both surface and line integrals. Stokes' theorem, which relies on specific properties of the original time-domain vector fields, does not directly apply to the transformed field unless inverse transformations are considered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "∫_(∂M) F · d r → ∫_M (∇ × F) · d A; L(F(t)) → transformed F(t); transformed F(t) on M → no further intervention",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the Laplace transform to the vector field F does not directly affect the relationship between the line integral over the boundary of the manifold and the surface integral of the curl of the field over the manifold. Therefore, if the transformed field evolves on the manifold without further intervention, Stokes' theorem still holds."
