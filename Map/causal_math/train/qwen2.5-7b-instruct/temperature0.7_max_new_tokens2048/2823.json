  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is used. We explore the properties as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoes transformations along the real and imaginary axes respectively in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + bi \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers.\n\nIf another function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z + c} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention after transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and before evaluating \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the final result of \\\\( g(f(h(z_0))) \\\\) rely only on the original transformation h?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the intervention \\\\( f(z) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, resulting in the composition of operations that significantly alter the input to \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Each transformation (scaling, rotation, translation) contributed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( f(z) \\\\) influences the final output, making the result dependent not only on h but also on f.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
