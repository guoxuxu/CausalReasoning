  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze how the impact of an integral transformation \\\\(T[u]=\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}u(t) dt\\\\) affects the system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T[u]\\\\) is applied to \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\(u_0\\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T[u]\\\\) changes the function u by transforming it into its Laplace Transform, which alters its characteristics significantly. The evolution thereafter under \\\\(L\\\\) does not preserve the original form of \\\\(u_0\\\\), resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the integral transformation T[u0] at t=0 influences the state of u(t) at time t=T, which is causally linked to directly evolving u0 to t=T under the differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu."
