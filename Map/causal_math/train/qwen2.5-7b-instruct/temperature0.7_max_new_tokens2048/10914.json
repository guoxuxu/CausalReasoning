  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x) \\) defined in the complex plane, where \\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\). We are interested in the mappings done by \\( \\phi(z) = z^2 \\) and explore how these transformations affect \\( z \\) as \\( x \\) varies along the real axis.\n\nCan we determine \\( f(x_0) \\) after observing \\( z(x_1) \\) under \\( \\phi(z) \\) without knowing whether \\( \\phi \\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( z(x_1) \\) under \\( \\phi \\) without prior knowledge of the initial application means that the process \\( f(x) \\) that evolved \\( x_0 \\) to \\( x_1 \\) might have been altered in a way that makes recovering \\( x_0 \\) impossible. The application of \\( \\phi \\) complicates the mapping, introducing potential multiple solutions, and \\( f(x) \\)'s integral nature limits reversibility.",
