  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by an integral transform \\\\( L[u(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation. Suppose we introduce a perturbation function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + p(x) \\\\).\n\nWill the operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the perturbed function \\\\( v(x) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( L[v(x)] \\\\), result in the same transformed outcome as if \\\\( L \\\\) was applied solely to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without the perturbation?",
  "Explanation": "Because \\\\( L \\\\) is linear, applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) \\\\) results in \\\\( L[u(x)] + L[p(x)] \\\\). Unless \\\\( L[p(x)] = 0 \\\\) for all x, this is not equivalent to \\\\( L[u(x)] \\\\). The presence of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) changes the outcome of the transformation.",
