  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). Let us examine the causal effects and inferences in systems characterized by convolution and multiplication operations in the Laplace domain leading to end solutions in time domain.\n\nIf an external function \\\\( p(t) \\\\), transforming to \\\\( P(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, is applied to modify \\\\( g(t) \\\\) during convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), does the transformed outcome in the Laplace domain solely depend on the original \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and modified \\\\( G(s)P(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output, now represented by \\\\( H(s)G(s)P(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, is directly influenced by the new input \\\\( P(s) \\\\) as well as the original \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and modified \\\\( G(s) \\\\). This represents the linear and direct impact of convolution and multiplication transformations in the Laplace domain according to the convolution theorem and properties of linear systems.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An external function p(t) transforming to P(s) in the Laplace domain modifies g(t) to G(s), and when g(t) * h(t) is convolved with p(t), the resulting Laplace domain expression is G(s)H(s)P(s)."
