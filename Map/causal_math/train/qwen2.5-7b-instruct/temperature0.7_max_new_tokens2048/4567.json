  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical model where an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A and s are scalars indicating the rate constants.\n\nIf a function modification \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is applied at an intermediate time during the integration process of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), will this intervention affect the outcome of \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) changes the function being transformed from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to a potentially different exponential function depending on B. The result \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\) will then defer significantly depending on how and when \\\\( g \\\\) intersects \\\\( e^{At} \\\\). The final transformed function isn't necessarily maintained as would be solely with \\\\( e^{At} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) and the scalar A directly determine T(f)(s), while the function g(t) and scalar B do not affect T(f)(s) because T(f)(s) is calculated based on the initial function f(t) and the scalar s."
