  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nAfter applying the FT to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\), can we accurately determine that the original signal was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "With only the Fourier Transform outcome of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), and not knowing about the pre-transformation multiplication by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), it is impossible to reconstruct the original signal uniquely. The frequency shift could mask or mimic effects of other potential transformations.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a real exponential multiplication by e^{-at} to z(t) results in z'(t), and the Fourier Transform of z(t) is F(ω). The derivative of z(t) with respect to time and the application of the Fourier Transform are causal steps transforming z(t) into z'(t) and F(ω) respectively."
