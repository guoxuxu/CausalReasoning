  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) representing a surface in 3D space. We are examining the effect of two transformations: \\\\(T1(u,v) = (u+1, v-1)\\\\) and \\\\(T2(u,v) = (uv, u-v)\\\\) on the initial coordinate point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\(z(x, y)\\\\) at a transformed point after applying \\\\(T1\\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\(T1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\(T1\\\\), inferring the original coordinates \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) from the new point \\\\((x_0 + 1, y_0 - 1)\\\\) and the value of \\\\(z\\\\) is not possible, as multiple points could yield the same \\\\(z\\\\) value and transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T1 determines the value of z and the coordinates (x, y). The original point (x_0, y_0) leads to T1 which in turn influences z."
