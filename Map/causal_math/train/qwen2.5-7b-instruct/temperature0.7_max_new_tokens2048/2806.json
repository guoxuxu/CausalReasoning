  "Problem": "Consider the evolution of a complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) under transformation by integration against a kernel function \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\), where \\\\( z, s \\\\) are complex variables. The transformation is described by \\\\( w'(z) = \\\\int_D K(z, s) w(s) ds \\\\). Assume that \\\\( K \\\\) modifies how the function behaves in the domain differently based on its parameters.\n\nAfter observing the evolved state \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at some later point, without intervention, can we deduce the original function \\\\( w_0 \\\\) if we do not specifically know whether the kernel transformation \\\\( K \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certain knowledge of the application of the kernel \\\\( K \\\\), and given the potentially transformational influence of \\\\( K \\\\) on \\\\( w_0 \\\\), deducing the original state of \\\\( w_0 \\\\) from \\\\( w(z) \\\\) becomes infeasible, as \\\\( K \\\\) may have altered initial conditions or developmental pathways within \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel function K(z, s) and the function values w(s) at various points in the domain D together determine the transformed function w'(z) through integration."
