  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The system is analyzed under the transformation defined by the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-At^2} \\\\).\n\nGiven the final observed output after the interventions, can we decipher exactly what transformations (either \\\\( e^{-At^2} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-Ct} \\\\) or both) were originally applied, merely by observing the end result?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of functions and intervening transformations can lead to indistinguishable outcomes due to complexities in how the transformations imposed by A and C impact the resultant function. The end result might not necessarily reveal discernible clues about which specific transformations or sequences of transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
