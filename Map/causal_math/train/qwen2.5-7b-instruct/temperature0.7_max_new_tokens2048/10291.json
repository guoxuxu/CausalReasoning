  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) which is a complex exponential representing oscillatory behavior with a constant \\\\( C \\\\) and angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\). An operator \\\\( T \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as follows: \\\\( Tz(t) = z(t + h) \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a time-shift constant.\n\nIf an additional operator \\\\( U \\\\) defined by \\\\( Uz(t) = z(t - k) \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant time-shift) is applied as an intervention at t = \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and T > k depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U \\\\) adds an opposing time-shift effect, thereby further modifying the trajectory of the system along with the earlier time-shift by \\\\( T \\\\). Thus, the final state at time T depends on both time shifts (\\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\)), as well as the underlying frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), leading to a complex interplay of shift interactions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
