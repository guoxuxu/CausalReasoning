  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\). An integral transformation using a kernel \\\\( K(u,v;x,y) = e^{-(u^2+v^2)} \\\\) is applied, transforming the function to \\\\( F(u,v) = \\\\int \\\\int e^{-(u^2+v^2)}(x^2 + y^2) dx dy \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation defined by \\\\( G(u,v) = \\\\int \\\\int (u-v)^2 K(u,v;x,y) dx dy \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\) for time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend strictly on the original function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) and not on the new transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation introduces a different integral kernel which alters the dependency on the original variables x and y, creating a new function based also on the difference \\\\( (u-v)^2 \\\\) in addition to the existing terms. This makes the final \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\) dependent on both the original and new transformations.",
