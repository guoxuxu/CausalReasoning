  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. An integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to study its properties over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf an intervention \\( P(z) = z + c \\), where \\( c \\) is a complex constant, is introduced at time \\( t_1 \\), will \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) still only be determined by \\( \\omega \\) and not influenced by \\( c \\) or \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( P(z) \\) shifts \\( z \\) by a constant \\( c \\), altering the initial condition for the subsequent evolution. This modified initial condition changes the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\), making the final state \\( z(T) \\) dependent on \\( c \\) as well as \\( \\omega \\), and is independent of \\( T(z) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
