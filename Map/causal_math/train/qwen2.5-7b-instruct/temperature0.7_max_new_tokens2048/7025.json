  "Problem": "Consider the control of a heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) on a domain, where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a thermal diffusivity constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) denotes the Laplacian. An intervention involves changing boundary conditions at a specific time using a function \\\\( h(t,x) = e^{\\\\lambda t}g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is a spatial function.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the system evolves under \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time T be the same as if the initial condition was the steady-state solution satisfying \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) under the same boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\) modifies the boundary conditions dynamically, and since heat equations are sensitive to initial and boundary conditions, the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) will evolve differently from the steady-state solution unless \\\\( \\\\lambda = 0 \\\\). This varying boundary condition influences how heat diffuses throughout the domain over time.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the boundary condition h(t,x) at t=0 influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) over time. The temperature distribution u(x,t) at time T depends on the initial conditions and evolves according to the heat equation. The steady-state solution, which satisfies the heat equation with zero right-hand side under the given boundary conditions, would result in a different temperature distribution u(x,t) compared to the one influenced by h(t,x) if no other interventions occur."
