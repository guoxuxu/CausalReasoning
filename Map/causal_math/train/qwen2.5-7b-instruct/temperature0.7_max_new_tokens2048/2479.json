  "Problem": "In a control theory context, consider the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\\\) where C and D are constant matrices, and u is a control input. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform on the system's response, particularly through an impulse response represented by matrix H, where H is defined as the transformation \\\\(H(s) = C^{-1}D\\\\).\n\nIf a modification is applied to the matrix D to become \\\\(D'\\\\) at t = t_1 as an intervention, and the input u remains an impulse at t = 0, will the new Laplace transform of the output Y'(s) still directly yield H(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification in D to \\\\(D'\\\\) alters the system's response characteristics, specifically changing the impulse response matrix from H(s) to \\\\((C^{-1}D')\\\\). This intervention changes the output transform, and thus Y'(s) will yield a different transform, not H(s).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A modification to matrix D directly causes changes in H; D' at t = t_1 directly causes changes in the system's behavior; the input u being an impulse at t = 0 directly causes the system's initial response; the state x directly causes the output Y; therefore, the new Laplace transform of the output Y'(s) may not directly yield H(s) due to the change in D."
