  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time t according to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf an initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) is used at t = 0 and then evolved under the specified equations without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T exhibit the same behavior as a directly transformed and then evolved function?",
  "Explanation": "The initial integral transformation modifies the time behavior of the function, interacting with the dynamics dictated by A and B. Therefore, starting with \\\\( T[z_0](t) \\\\) and subsequently evolving it under A and B will not yield the same end function as transforming an already evolved function, due to the non-commutative nature of differential operators and integral transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of x(t) and y(t) under their respective matrices A and B determines z(t); the integral transformation T applied to z_0(t) results in T[z_0](t), which when evaluated at t exhibits the same behavior as transforming and then evolving the function z(t) under matrix C."
