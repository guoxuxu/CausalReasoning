  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) in one dimension, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant representing the diffusion coefficient. We introduce the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior under various scenarios.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) = e^{-k \\\\omega^2 t} \\\\) of a function at time t, can we conclusively infer that the initial condition was \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\delta(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific form of the Fourier Transform \\\\( e^{-k \\\\omega^2 t} \\\\) is uniquely linked to the heat equation with the initial condition of a Dirac delta function centered at zero. This relationship is well-defined due to the unique properties of the solution to the heat equation with this initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
