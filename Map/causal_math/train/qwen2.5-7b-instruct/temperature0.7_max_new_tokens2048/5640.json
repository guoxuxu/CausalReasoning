  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) characterizing a process dependent on the variable x. We further explore how the transformations through application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by \\\\( L(z) = z'(x) \\\\), impact the outcomes when \\\\( z(x) \\\\) evolves under a complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 + i \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nCan we determine whether the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied as an intervention, solely by examining the output \\\\( w(z(x_2)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( w(z(x_2)) \\\\) may be indistinguishable in cases where different inputs are subject to varying transformations, such as those introduced by \\\\( L \\\\) or other potential intervening processes. The complex function \\\\( w \\\\) may mask or emulate the effect of the linear transformation, resulting in non-unique forward paths that share common endpoints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
