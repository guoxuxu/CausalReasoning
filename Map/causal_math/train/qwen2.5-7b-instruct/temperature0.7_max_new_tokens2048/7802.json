  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) representing the solution to a system of linear differential equations with a matrix A. An external operator modifies the trajectory through a time-dependent matrix transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the functional form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can the initial condition \\\\( x \\\\) be deduced accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of an unknown \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) as part of the evolution implies that the transformation incurred can be incompatible or non-invertible with respect to \\\\( A \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( B \\\\), it is impossible to reverse the effect of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) reliably to retrieve the initial \\\\( x \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) influences the deduction of the initial condition x, but direct causal relation from z(T) → x cannot be established without knowledge of g(t) and the specific form of matrices A and B."
