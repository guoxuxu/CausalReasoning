  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where t represents time. Consider further the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), defined for complex s where Re(s) > 0.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is theoretically invertible under suitable conditions; however, practical inversion generally requires knowledge of the entire function over all s, and possible singularities or essential details could be lost in transformation, making precise reconstruction non-trivial.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
