  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix and z is a complex variable. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) on the behavior of the system.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a differential operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\) is applied after the integral transformation and before evaluating at z = Z, will the result at z = Z be independent of the initial integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The differential operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\) effectively negates the integral transformation, returning the function to its original form \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\). Therefore, the result at z = Z is independent of the initial integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w(z) determines the integral transformation, which then influences the derivative dw/dz, ultimately affecting the result at z = Z."
