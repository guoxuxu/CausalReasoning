  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T correspond to the direct computation of the integral from 0 to T of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct computation of \\\\( T(z)(T) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\omega t} dt \\\\) is the definition of applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). There are no alterations or additional interventions made to modify the trajectory or the calculation method.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) = e^(iωt) directly causes T(z) to be the integral from 0 to t of z(τ)dτ, which in turn directly causes T(z)(T) to represent the integral from 0 to T of e^(iωt)."
