  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{At} dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and exploring how its behavior changes when transformed by function \\\\( T_M(t) = Me^{At}M^{-1} \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to each term of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) during the integral calculation, will \\\\( \\\\int_0^T L(e^{At}) dt \\\\) just depend on the properties of A ignoring the effects of transformation \\\\( T_M(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of L influences the result, and the transformation \\\\( T_M(t) \\\\) also impacts the outcome due to how matrix functions interact. The operator L modifies each term of the original function before the transformation, suggesting a compound effect that depends on both A and the nature of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The integral of \\( e^{At} \\) depends on the properties of A, and applying a linear operator L to each term of \\( e^{At} \\) during integration does not change this dependency; the transformation \\( T_M(t) \\) affects the form of \\( e^{At} \\) but does not alter the integral's dependence on A."
