  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit composed of a resistor (R), inductor (L), capacitor (C), and a power source that applies a voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system is described by the differential equation \\\\( V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int_0^t I(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the current as a function of time.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the voltage source is doubled from \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\\\omega_0 \\\\) at the start, without any other intervention, will the steady state impedance observed in the circuit be the same as if \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) was kept at \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the frequency of the voltage source affects the impedance of the circuit due to the frequency-dependent behavior of the inductor and capacitor. The impedance of the circuit, given by \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = R + i(\\\\omega L - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega C}) \\\\), will differ, indicating different current response characteristics at different frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → Impedance; ω → Current; Current → Voltage",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Doubling the frequency ω from ω₀ to 2ω₀ changes the current and thus the voltage in the circuit, leading to different steady state impedance compared to keeping ω at ω₀."
