  "Problem": "Consider a boundary value problem for the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a bounded region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) with boundary conditions specified by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\). We investigate the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary data \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then solving the modified problem.\n\nCan we recover the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) exactly from the solution \\\\( u \\\\) inside \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) after the boundary data has been transformed by the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( u \\\\) inside \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) after applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) contains modified boundary characteristics that are not easily invertible back to the original \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without additional information or assumptions about the nature of the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
