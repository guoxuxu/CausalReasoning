  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) operating on the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. We explore how linear transformations given by matrices affect this function through Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\), characterized as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation matrix \\\\( A \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), altering it to \\\\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) be independent of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of matrix \\\\( A \\\\) alters the function before the Fourier Transform is applied, which affects the transform \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) as it now includes the effects of \\\\( A \\\\). This change is not merely a phase or scale shift, implying dependence on the characteristics of matrix \\\\( A \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of a transformation matrix A to z(t) at time t_0 results in a new function that, when transformed via Fourier Transform, yields Z(ω) which is then input into the Fourier Transform process."
