  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), and A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\), on this system.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( G(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the future state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) = z^2 \\\\) introduces additional nonlinear dynamics to the original linear system governed by A and B. Therefore, the final state depends on the original systems (A and B), and how the intervention altered the pathway, introducing new dynamics and dependencies.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
