  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\( x' = Dx \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Study the effect of the transformation \\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\) over time t, where L is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( x' \\) evolves under \\( x' = Dx \\) without any further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) had been directly evolved to t = T under \\( x' = Dx \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(x) \\) uses a different matrix L which modifies the initial conditions through \\( e^{Lt} \\). Although S diagonalizes D, the evolution under L could lead to a different trajectory due to different eigenvalues or eigenfunctions associated with L compared to those of D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(x) to x_0 at t=0 and then evolving x under x' = Dx for time T results in the same state as directly evolving x_0 under x' = Dx for time T."
