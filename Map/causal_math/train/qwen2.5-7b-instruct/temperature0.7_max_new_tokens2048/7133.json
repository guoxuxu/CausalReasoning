  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. For this scenario, let's investigate the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined as an integral transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) from initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) without application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), will the solution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t, specifically at t = T, be purely dependent on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any additional transformation leads to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\). Hence, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time T purely depends on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
