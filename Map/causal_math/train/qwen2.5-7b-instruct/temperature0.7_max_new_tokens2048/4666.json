  "Problem": "Consider a physical scenario where heat propagation in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity. We analyze the system's response to a time-dependent boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the state of the rod in terms of temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a time t > 0, can we unequivocally backtrack and determine the exact boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) that was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "While the current temperature distribution provides some information about earlier states, exact determination of the boundary condition like \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) from \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) alone is generally not possible without additional data. Multiple boundary conditions could lead to similar temperature distributions at a later time.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of temperature with respect to time (u_t) is proportional to the second derivative of temperature with respect to position (u_xx), thermal conductivity (k) influences the rate of change of temperature with respect to time (u_t) and the second derivative of temperature with respect to position (u_xx), and the boundary condition at one end of the rod (u(0,t)) determines the temperature distribution throughout the rod (u(x,t))."
