  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We explore the effects of pre-multiplying the input signal by a modulation function \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf during the transformation phase an additional exponential modulation \\\\( n(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a real number) is applied as an intervention, will the final transformed signal \\\\( X(s) \\\\) for s = s_0 depend purely on a and not on b?",
  "Explanation": "The additional modulation modifies the signal once more, shifting the Laplace domain representation to \\\\( X(s-a-b) \\\\). Hence, the final transformed signal depends on both values, \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), reflecting the cumulative effects of both modulations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
