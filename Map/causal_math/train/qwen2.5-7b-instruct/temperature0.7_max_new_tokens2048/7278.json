  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( u(x, T) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we deduce the original function \\( u(x, 0) \\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\( u(x, 0) \\). The Fourier transform could have fundamentally changed the initial conditions, which affects how the solution evolves according to \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of u(x, T) at time T influences the original function u(x, 0). Applying a Fourier transform to u(x, 0) results in the state u(x, T) at time T, and applying the inverse Fourier transform to u(x, T) recovers u(x, 0)."
