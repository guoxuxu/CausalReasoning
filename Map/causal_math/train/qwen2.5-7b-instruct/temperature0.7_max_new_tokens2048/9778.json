  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze how the impact of an integral transformation \\\\(T[u]=\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}u(t) dt\\\\) affects the system.\n\nAfter observing \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original function \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\(T[u]\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(T[u]\\\\) was involved, it is impossible to reverse-engineer to the original function \\\\(u_0\\\\) because the Laplace transform fundamentally alters the function in an irreversible manner without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
