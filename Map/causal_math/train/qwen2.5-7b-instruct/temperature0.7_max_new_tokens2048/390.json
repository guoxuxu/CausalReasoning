  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant complex matrix. The evolution of this system is impacted by an integral transform \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Qt} z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex matrix and T is a fixed end time.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be determined uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the application of \\\\( H(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(T) = e^{PT} z_0 \\\\), the relationship between \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is unique and invertible as long as P has no zero eigenvalues, allowing us to compute \\\\( z_0 = e^{-PT} z(T) \\\\) irrespective of the integral transformation \\\\( H(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) influences z(t) through the differential equation, which in turn determines z(T). The matrix P governs the rate of change of z(t). The integral transform H(z) depends on z(t) and is related to z(T), but it does not uniquely determine z(0) from z(T) without additional information."
