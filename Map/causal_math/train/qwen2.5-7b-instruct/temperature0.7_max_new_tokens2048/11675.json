  "Problem": "Investigate the influence of a linear operator transformation \\\\( z = L(x) \\\\) on a vector field \\\\( x \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The transformation L represents another linear operator with a constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional linear transformation \\\\( H \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( L \\\\) and solely determined by M and H?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on L, M, and H. The transformations imposed by L initially, and H later, both play critical roles. These factors, combined with the dynamics driven by M, contribute to a state at T that relies on all three matrices, affected by their interaction and properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) is influenced by the linear operator L through z, and by the linear transformation H and the matrix M governing the dynamics of x, with H's effect becoming significant only after t_1."
