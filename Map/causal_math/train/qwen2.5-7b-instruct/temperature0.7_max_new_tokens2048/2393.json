  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We investigate the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\) on the function over time t.\n\nIf the Fourier transformation is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to proceed without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) at some frequency \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\) remain identical to the initial function over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), which is ideally a delta function at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), signifies an exact frequency component. However, applying the Fourier transformation alters the function into a different domain (frequency domain), which fundamentally changes its representation and cannot be equated directly to the time-domain function over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
