  "Problem": "Imagine we are studying a linear system of differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant coefficient matrix. To examine the behavior under different transformations, we introduce the function \\\\( g(x) = x^T Qx \\\\), a quadratic form where Q is a symmetric constant matrix.\n\nBy knowing the result of \\\\( g(x(T)) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to determine the exact initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) before the system was subjected to \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The quadratic transformation introduces a structural change that may not be invertible, particularly as multiple initial states can yield the same transformed output under \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Without knowing if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) function or its specific form was used, reconstructing \\\\( x(0) \\\\) from \\\\( g(x(T)) \\\\) is ambiguous and can lead to multiple feasible answers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
