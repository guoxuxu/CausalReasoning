  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform in space, given by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t)\\\\), on the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new thermal conductivity profile is applied altering \\\\(k\\\\) to a new value \\\\(k'\\\\), will the final transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial thermal diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the thermal conductivity parameter \\\\(k\\\\) to \\\\(k'\\\\) during the evolution process alters the heat distribution and thus affects the Fourier transform. Since the system’s response depends on thermal diffusivity, both the initial and modified values of \\\\(k\\\\) influence the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u(x,0) influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) which then evolves according to the thermal diffusivity k. After time t1, when k changes to k', the final transformed state \\u(ξ,T) depends on the value of k' rather than the initial k."
