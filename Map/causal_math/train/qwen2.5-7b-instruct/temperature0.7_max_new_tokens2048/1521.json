  "Problem": "Consider the fluid dynamics described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Let \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid, where \\\\( x \\\\) is the position and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We investigate the behavior of the fluid under a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\vec{u}) = \\\\nabla \\\\times (\\\\vec{u}) \\\\), which represents the curl of the velocity field.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(\\\\vec{u}) \\\\) is applied to the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0 \\\\) at time t = 0, and the fluid is then allowed to evolve according to the Navier-Stokes equations without further intervention, will the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the Navier-Stokes equations?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(\\\\vec{u}) \\\\) modifies the initial velocity distribution by incorporating rotational attributes from the curl operation. This transformation changes the initial conditions and the subsequent evolution of the fluid, resulting in a different velocity field at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the curl transformation to the initial velocity field and its subsequent evolution under the Navier-Stokes equations from time t=0 to t=T results in a different velocity field than directly evolving the initial velocity field under the Navier-Stokes equations from t=0 to t=T."
