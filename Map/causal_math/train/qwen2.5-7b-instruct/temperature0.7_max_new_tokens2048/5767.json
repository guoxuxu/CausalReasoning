  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation under the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F \\\\). The Fourier Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift is introduced, transforming the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta) t} \\\\) for some constant \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\), and then the Fourier Transform is applied, will the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) remain a single peak at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a phase shift modifies the frequency of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\). Thus, the peak in the Fourier Transform spectrum shifts accordingly to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\). The spectrum will not contain the peak at the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but instead at the altered frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z(t) transforms under the Fourier Transform to produce the spectrum hat{z}(ω). Introducing a phase shift δ modifies z(t) to z(t) with a new frequency ω + δ, which then transforms to a new spectrum hat{z}(ω) centered around ω + δ."
