  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant scalar. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function u(x, t) and consider its evolution under the given differential equation.\n\nIf an intervening transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u) \\\\) defined by an additional operation like a Laplace transform is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial Fourier transform and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u) \\\\) represents an additional transformation that cannot be generalized merely through the initial Fourier transformation. The system’s final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) would now be modified not only by the dynamics defined by A but also by the effects of the Laplace transformation, making it dependent on both the initial condition and the intervention type.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x,t) → u(x,T); Fourier transform(\\( \\mathcal{F} \\)) → u(x,ω); \\( \\mathcal{G}(u) \\) → u(x,t'); u(x,t') → u(x,T); t < t'",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to u(x,t) results in u(x,ω). The intervention of applying the Laplace transform \\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u) \\\\) at time \\( t_1 \\\\) leads to u(x,t'), and this change affects u(x,T) for T > t_1."
