  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical scenario where a signal x(t) undergoes a Fourier Transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt\\\\). Further, this transformed signal is modified via a filter function H(ω), and the composite effect \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is obtained by applying the Inverse Fourier Transform to \\\\(H(\\\\omega) \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf the signal x(t) is input without any modifications and H(ω) is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, does y(t) depend solely on the properties of H(ω) and x(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Since H(ω) is linear and time-invariant, the output y(t) will be the convolution of x(t) with the impulse response of H(ω), making it depend only on x(t) and the properties of H(ω), assuming no additional intervention.",
