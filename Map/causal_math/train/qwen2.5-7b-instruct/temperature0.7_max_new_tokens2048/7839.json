  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant, and an integral transformation \\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\). We study how the transformation influences the properties of function \\( f \\) over complex domain.\n\nIf an additional operation \\( g(z) = \\log(z) \\) is applied to transform the function \\( f(z) \\) at some \\( z_1 \\) within its domain, and then \\( T \\) is applied, will \\( T[g \\circ f](s) \\) for \\( s > a \\) solely depend on \\( f(z) \\) without influence of \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) = \\log(z) \\) before \\( T \\) introduces a functional transformation that significantly alters \\( f(z) \\)'s behavior. The impacts of the logarithmic modification substantially change the resulting \\( T[g \\circ f](s) \\), thus depending on both functions and their interplay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T depends on f(z), and applying g to f(z) before transformation results in T[g ∘ f](s) which is influenced by both f(z) and g(z). For s > a, T[g ∘ f](s) does not solely depend on f(z) without the influence of g."
