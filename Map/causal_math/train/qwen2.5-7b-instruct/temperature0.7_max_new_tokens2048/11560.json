  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega t} w \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The system under study is defined by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation on the system evolution.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\\\( z(w) \\\\), \\\\( h(w) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( w(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations of the interventions due to the properties of complex exponentials and the possible interactions between \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\theta t} \\\\). The non-uniqueness in potential trajectories and transformations precludes precisely identifying which interventions were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Time t directly influences the state w, which then determines both z(w) and h(w); z(w) and h(w) both influence w."
