  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system dynamics are further influenced by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the change in evolution function, or both), merely by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be reached by various combinations of initial transformation and pathway alteration, especially given the complex interplay between the exponential growth rates and transformations. The lack of a unique reverse pathway makes identifying the specific interventions based solely on the endpoint impossible without additional context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
