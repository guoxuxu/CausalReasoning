  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation on a complex function defined as \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. This transformation represents a Laplace transform that is widely used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems. The goal is to explore the manipulation and impacts of such transforms in various configurations, considering intervention by a differential operator.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a differentiation operation, \\\\(D(x(t)) = \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t)\\\\), is applied prior to taking the Laplace transform, will the result of \\\\(T(D(x(t)))\\\\) depend solely on the operator \\\\(s\\\\) and not on \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the differentiated function leads to \\\\(s \\\\cdot T(x(t)) - x(0)\\\\), which includes terms depending on both \\\\(s\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\), illustrating that the effect (transform of the derivative) depends critically on the original function parameter \\\\(a\\\\) along with the operational parameter \\\\(s\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the differentiation operator D(x(t)) before the Laplace transform results in T(D(x(t))), which depends on s but not on any other variable a."
