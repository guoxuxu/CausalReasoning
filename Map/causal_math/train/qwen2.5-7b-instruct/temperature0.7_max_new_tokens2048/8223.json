  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is the Laplace Transform. Let \\( f(t) \\) be a function such that \\( f(t) = t^2 \\). We intervene by adding a constant \\( k \\) to \\( f(t) \\), modifying it to \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\) before applying \\( \\mathcal{L} \\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( f(t) \\) to \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\) before applying \\( \\mathcal{L} \\), will the resulting transform only depend on the unmodified \\( f(t) \\) and not on \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( k \\) directly affects the result. The Laplace Transform of \\( t^2 + k \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} + \\frac{k}{s} \\). This addition changes the transform output to depend significantly on the value of \\( k \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of f_k(t) depends on both the original function f(t) and the constant k, with k directly causing a change in f_k(t), which in turn affects the Laplace transform."
