  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the state of a system \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), with \\( A \\) being a complex matrix. We inquire about the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) which modifies the system's frequency components.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of the Fourier transform, the manipulation of the frequency components by \\\\( F(z) \\\\) could have altered the initial state in ways that are not recoverable solely from observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The initial frequency content, crucial for reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\), might have been irreversibly changed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences the state z(t) at any time t, and consequently, the observed state z(T) at time T. The application of the Fourier transform F(z) affects the state z(t), but knowing z(T) alone does not allow us to infer z_0 without information about F(z)."
