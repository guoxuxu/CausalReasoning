  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane wherein a transformation \\\\( z \\\\to e^{kt} z \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where k is a complex constant. Analyze the transformation's effect on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a closed contour C.\n\nIf an intervention applies another transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\to f(e^{lt} z) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), where l is a different complex constant, will the final value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) remain dependent only on the initial k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with another transformation introduces a new modifying factor, changing the scale of dependency from the initial transformation parameter k to both k and l. The final integral value thus depends on the composition effects of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "k → transformation effect; l → intervention effect; t_1 → intervention timing; T → final integral value; initial k → initial transformation; initial k → initial function; l → modified function; t_1 → application of modification; T → integral after modification; T > t_1 → final state",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Initial k directly causes the transformation effect on the function f(z); l directly causes the modification of the function f(z) at time t_1; t_1 directly causes the application of the modification; T > t_1 directly causes the final value of the integral being dependent on both initial k and l."
