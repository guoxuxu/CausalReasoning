  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The effect of a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), on this system is analyzed.\n\nIf the initial conditions for \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) are set and the system evolves under its differential equations without any external intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any point s in the complex plane remain unaffected by the differing dynamics of x and y?",
  "Explanation": "The dynamics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), being governed by different matrices A and B, evolve differently. This difference directly affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and consequently alters the outcome of its Laplace transform, reflecting the unique contributions of the x and y components according to their exponential growth or decay characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial conditions x_0 and y_0 directly cause the values of x(t) and y(t) respectively. A and B directly cause the dynamics of x(t) and y(t) respectively. s directly causes the Laplace transform L(z). The differing dynamics of x and y do not directly affect the Laplace transform L(z) at any point s in the complex plane."
