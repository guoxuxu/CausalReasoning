  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is studied, where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) (where P is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another transformation component in the form of \\\\( e^{Pt} \\\\). The outcome at time T will then depend on the interactions among M, N, and P. These matrix effects could differentially modify the trajectory, making the final state a function of all matrices involved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
