  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant representing angular frequency and K a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( R(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which transformations were applied is challenging without additional information. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be reached through various combinations and sequences of transformations due to the complexities of integration effects and the dependencies on multiple parameters. This ambiguity arises from the non-linear interaction and overlap in potential effects of transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
