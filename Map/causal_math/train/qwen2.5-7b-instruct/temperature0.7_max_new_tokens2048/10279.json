  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Cu\\\\), where C is a linear operator. We further explore the role of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ds}u(s) ds \\\\) where D is another linear operator.\n\nIf an intervention by a transformation \\\\( R(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{t'} e^{Es}u(s) ds \\\\) (where E is a different linear operator) is applied at a time \\\\( t' \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t' \\\\) completely disregard the effects of \\\\( T(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( R(u) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, and the system's state at any time \\\\( T \\\\) would be influenced by both transformations, plus the solution to the original system. Thus, the effects of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) are not disregarded but compounded with effects from \\\\( R(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
