  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the Schrödinger-like equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. An intervention is defined by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\), where B is another constant matrix different from A.\n\nCan the interventions (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) used in the process be definitively identified from the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from various sequential or simultaneous applications of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or neither. The matrices A, B, and C could possibly have similar effects on z depending on their mathematical properties, leading to an equivalently possible end state for different intervention histories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
