  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Let \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition and \\\\( F(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, represents an integral transformation applied to \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\), \\\\( G(u) \\\\), or both), based solely on the final observed state?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions used is highly complex due to multiple potential combinations of transformations by \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) that could lead to the same observed final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The properties of exponential matrices and differential operators generally allow for different paths yielding similar end states, making unique identification infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state u(x, 0) directly influences the state u(x, t) at any time t, which in turn determines the final state u(x, T). Both transformations F(u) and G(u) can lead to the same final state u(x, T), making it impossible to uniquely determine which interventions were applied based solely on the final observed state."
