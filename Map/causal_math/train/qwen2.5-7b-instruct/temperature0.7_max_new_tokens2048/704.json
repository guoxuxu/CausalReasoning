  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where input signals are transformed via a complex function \\\\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z-1} \\\\\\) and then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\\\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}u(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\\\( a > 0 \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( u(t) \\\\\\) being the unit step function. The transformation due to \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) occurs in the complex frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine exactly which impulse response function was applied (\\\\\\{ g(t) \\\\\\} or \\\\\\{ g'(t) \\\\\\}), given the signal output at time \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) and knowing the transformation \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The output at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) might be similarly affected by either \\\\\\( g(t) \\\\\\) or \\\\\\( g'(t) \\\\\\) given the same input, especially if \\\\\\( a \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( b \\\\\\) are not distinct enough in their effects on the decay characteristics of the system response. Without additional context or data, distinguishing which function was in effect solely from the output is unreliable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
