  "Problem": "Assume a function defined on complex numbers \\\\(z\\\\) as \\\\(f(z) = e^{az}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. This function undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\) for \\\\(\\\\operatorname{Re}(s) > \\\\operatorname{Re}(a)\\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation on various scenarios.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\), can we conclusively determine the original function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and the value of \\\\(a\\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The uniqueness theorem of the Laplace transform states that if the transform of a function exists, then it is unique. Thus, given \\\\(F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\), we can uniquely determine that \\\\(f(z) = e^{az}\\\\) and identify the parameter \\\\(a\\\\) accurately.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
