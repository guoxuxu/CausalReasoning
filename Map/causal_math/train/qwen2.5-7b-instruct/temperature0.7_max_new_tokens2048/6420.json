  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a curve in the complex plane given by \\\\( z = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, describing an oscillator. We investigate the effects of a linear transformation described by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\\\\\\\ b & a \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) which rotates and scales the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nWith knowledge of the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and acknowledging interventions were possibly applied, can we pinpoint exactly which transformations (\\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both) were used before reaching \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The potential overlapping effects of multiple transformations (scaling and rotating) applied at different times prevent a definitive conclusion on the specific transformations used. The ambiguity remains due to the identical potential effects from different parameters of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) on the trajectory and final position of the state in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
