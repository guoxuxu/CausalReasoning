  "Problem": "Consider a mechanical system where the force \\( F \\) applied to an object causes it to accelerate according to Newton's second law \\( F = ma \\), where \\( m \\) is mass and \\( a \\) is acceleration. Suppose a particular transformation \\( h(a) = k \\cdot a \\) defines a modification to the acceleration, where \\( k \\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nIf at some point \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies the force acting on the object to \\( F' = m'a \\) where \\( m' \\) is a new mass, will the final position \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) primarily depend only on \\( m' \\) and not on the initial scaling factor \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the dynamics from \\( t_1 \\) onward, but the displacement accumulated before \\( t_1 \\) still reflects the initial \\( k \\) scaled acceleration. Therefore, the final position \\( x(T) \\) depends on the initial scaling \\( k \\), the original mass \\( m \\), and the new mass \\( m' \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
