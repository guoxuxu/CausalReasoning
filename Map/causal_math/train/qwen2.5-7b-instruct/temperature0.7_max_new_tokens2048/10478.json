  "Problem": "Analyze a stochastic process where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BX dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( dW \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process. Consider the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{CX} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) be inferred exactly from observing \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic nature of the differential equation combined with the potential unknown application of \\\\( e^{CX} \\\\) to the initial state results in multiple possible initial states that could have led to the observed \\\\( X(T) \\\\). The uncertainty in initial transformation obscures the back-calculations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state X(t) influences X(T) through the stochastic differential equation. A and B cause changes in dX, which integrates to affect X(T). W introduces randomness affecting dX. The matrix C influences the transformation f(X) independently of the path taken by X(t) to reach X(T)."
