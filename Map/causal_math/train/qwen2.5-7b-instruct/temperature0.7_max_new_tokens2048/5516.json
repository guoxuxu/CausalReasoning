  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter and \\\\( i \\\\) the imaginary unit. This function represents the solution to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). We examine the effect of applying a linear operator, represented by matrix A, to alter the function: \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be precisely determined which operators were applied (whether \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), or both), and at what times, merely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a product of compound transformations and exponential evolution, making it challenging to disentangle and precisely determine not just which transformations (A or B) were used, but also when they were applied, due to the linear superposition principle and the lack of unique inverses for arbitrary operators A and B in the general case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency parameter ω directly influences the function z(t). The linear operator A directly alters the function z to produce f(z). The function z(t) evolves over time to reach the final state z(T). Applying the linear operator A results in the state f(z), which transitions to z(T)."
