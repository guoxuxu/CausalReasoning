  "Problem": "Imagine a mechanical system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + p\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. An external force described by a function \\\\(f(t) = A\\\\sin(ωt)\\\\) is potentially applied to the system, affecting its behavior.\n\nIf the system starts with initial conditions \\\\(x(0) = x_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = v_0\\\\), and no external force \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is applied, will the motion of the system at time T be described solely by the homogeneous solution to the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Without the external force, the system's motion is governed only by its inherent properties (p, q) and initial conditions (x_0, v_0), leading to a solution that can be represented as a combination of exponential and sinusoidal functions intrinsic to the homogeneous differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constants p and q determine the system's dynamics, initial conditions x_0 and v_0 set the starting state, and time T dictates the state of the system. If no external force acts on the system, its motion at time T is described by the homogeneous solution determined by p, q, x_0, v_0, and T."
