  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. This function represents a simple harmonic motion on the complex plane. We examine the effects of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a constant integer, on the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) (where m is another constant integer) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's state at time T > t_1 be solely dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) irrespective of n or m?",
  "Explanation": "The final state depends on both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). After applying \\\\( g \\\\), the function evolves as \\\\( z(t)^{nm} \\\\) for t > t_1, resulting in a state dependent on both n and m, affecting the frequency and amplitude differently than \\\\( \\omega \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω determines the behavior of z(t) over time. The constants n and m affect z(t) and z(t_1) respectively but do not influence the state of z(T) beyond t_1 once the intervention g(z) = z^m is applied at t_1. Thus, the state of z(T) is primarily determined by ω after the intervention."
