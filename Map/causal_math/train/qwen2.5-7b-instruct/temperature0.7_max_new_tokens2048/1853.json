  "Problem": "Consider the space of complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Suppose we apply an integral transformation represented by \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) at any future time \\\\(T\\\\) represent the same transform as if \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\(T\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) is a linear and time-invariant operator due to its integral nature over exponentials. Hence, the initial transformation and subsequent evolution governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) will yield the same result irrespective of the initial condition or the progression of time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) under the differential equation dz/dt = iωz determines the form of z(t) at any time t, which in turn influences the integral transform hat{z}(s) at that time. Therefore, hat{z}(T) represents the same transform as if z_0(t) was directly evolved to T under dz/dt = iωz."
