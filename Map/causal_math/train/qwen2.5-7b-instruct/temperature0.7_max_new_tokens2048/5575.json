  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{1} e^{tz} dt \\\\) is applied, which modifies subsystem behaviors dynamically.\n\nIf at a certain time during the application of \\\\( I(Kx) \\\\), an intervention by applying another transformation \\\\( L(z) = Mz \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is introduced, will the resulting outcome depend only on K and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds another layer of complex transformation through M, impacting both the intermediate and the final states. The outcome after this intervention will reflect influences from both K and M, through combined and sequential impacts on the initial vector within the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The outcome depends on K through I(Kx) and is also influenced by L(z) via the introduction of M in L(z). However, the direct dependency of the outcome on M is conditional upon the application of L(z)."
