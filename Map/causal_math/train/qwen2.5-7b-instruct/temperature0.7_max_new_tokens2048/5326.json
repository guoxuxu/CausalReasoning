  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant real matrices. An integral transformation is applied, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ct'} z(t') dt' \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after analyzing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's challenging to deduce the exact original function as the integral transformation with matrix C may have significantly altered initial states and trajectories that cannot be simply inverted without further information.",
