  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subject to a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. We also consider the effect of an integral transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ks} z(s) ds \\\\) over a time interval [0,T], where K is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is known and no additional intervention is applied, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves solely under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) for t in [0, T], is the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely determined by M and \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Under the given conditions, the solution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t, including T, is uniquely determined by the linear autonomous differential equation and the initial condition. The evolution is governed by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\), making \\\\( z(T) = e^{MT}z(0) \\\\), dependent only on M and \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
