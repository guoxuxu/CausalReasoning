  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) in the complex plane, where A is a real constant and i represents the imaginary unit. The function describes rotation around the origin with angular velocity A. We explore different transformations involving the operator \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, and examine the trajectories and causality in this rotating system.\n\nCan we, by looking at the function value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), uniquely determine the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied at t = 0 and the exact time of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The final observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T can result from various combinations of initial power k in \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\) and different moments of changing the angular velocity (at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)). The rotating nature and exponential function's sensitivity to initial conditions create a multitude of possible trajectories leading to the same endpoint without a unique solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The intervention time t_1 directly causes the observation time T. The constant A directly causes the function value z(t). The function value at t_1 directly causes the function value at T. The exponent k directly causes the function value at T."
