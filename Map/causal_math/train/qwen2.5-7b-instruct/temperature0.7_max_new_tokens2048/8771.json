  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the causal effects using the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), which transforms this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf during the transformation we add a damping factor, modifying the signal to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(-\\alpha + i\\omega) t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\)), will the resulting Laplace Transform shift the pole to the left in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) alters the exponent in the signal to \\\\( -\\alpha + i\\omega \\\\). This results in a shift of the Laplace Transform pole to \\\\( s = -\\alpha + i\\omega \\), moving it to the left in the complex plane due to the real part \\\\( -\\alpha \\\\), indicating a decaying exponential component in addition to the oscillatory behavior.",
