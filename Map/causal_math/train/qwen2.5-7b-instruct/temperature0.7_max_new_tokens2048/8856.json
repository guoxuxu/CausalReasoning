  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the effects of applying the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the system's state at some \\\\( z(T_2) \\\\) where \\\\( T_2 > T_1 \\\\), after applying both the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine the order or occurrence of these transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlap in the influence of the transformations on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and the inability to isolate the specific effects of each transformation solely based on the state at \\\\( T_2 \\\\), it is not feasible to exactly determine the sequence or individual implementation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). They could result in the same final state through different temporal applications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The values of x(t) and y(t) directly determine z(t); z(t) is transformed into f(z) through integration; f(z) represents the state of z at T2; similarly, g(z) also represents the state of z at T2."
