  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyse how this function transforms under the operation of a complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} f(x) dx \\\\).\n\nIf the complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) result in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transform to \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), given by \\\\( T[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} e^{ix} dx \\\\), simplifies to \\\\( T[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{i(1-s)x} dx \\\\). This results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\) due to the orthogonality principle in Fourier series, as the integral evaluates to zero for all \\\\( s \\\\) except \\\\( s = 1 \\\\).",
