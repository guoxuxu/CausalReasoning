  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\) that changes u from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.\n\nIf a Laplace transformation \\\\( L(u) = \\\\tilde{u}(s) \\\\) as an intervention is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the system's evolution, will the final form of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the initial operator L, regardless of whether a Fourier or Laplace transformation was previously used?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a Laplace transformation modifies the system's representation and its response characteristics. Because we evolve the function under the operator L which might behave differently in various transformation domains, the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is influenced by the full history of transformations, not just L alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "F(u) → u(k); L(u) → u(s); F(u) → L(u); L(u) → u(t); u(t) → u(x, T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Fourier transformation F(u) converts the function u from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, while applying a Laplace transformation L(u) converts it to the complex frequency domain. The operator L directly influences the form of u over time, and the state of u at any time t influences its state at later times x, T. Regardless of previous transformations, the final form of u(x, T) depends on the operator L and the initial conditions."
