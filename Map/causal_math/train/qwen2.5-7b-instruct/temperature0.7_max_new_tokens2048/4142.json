  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is further studied under the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with unknown application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was employed, without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or confirming the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to distinguish if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the natural progression under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) or modified dynamics due to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The transform could fundamentally alter the trajectory and final characteristics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), masking the effects solely attributed to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant frequency ω directly causes the rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt). The constant α directly causes the transformation g(z). The initial state z_0 directly causes the value of z at time T (z(T)). Applying the transformation g(z) directly causes the value of z at time T (z(T))."
