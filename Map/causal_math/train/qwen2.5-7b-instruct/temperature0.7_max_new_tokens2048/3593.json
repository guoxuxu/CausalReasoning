  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\), where f(t) is an original function in the time domain. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k f(t) \\\\) where k is a non-negative integer, and the implication of such transformations on the resulting function in the complex s-domain.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) = t^k f(t) \\\\) is applied from t = 0 and allowed to evolve without further transformation, does the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\) and k?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k f(t) \\\\) leads to a Laplace transform that involves the original transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) differentiated k times with respect to s, i.e., \\\\( (-1)^k \\\\frac{d^k}{ds^k}F(s) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) \\\\) directly depends only on \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\) and the integer k.",
