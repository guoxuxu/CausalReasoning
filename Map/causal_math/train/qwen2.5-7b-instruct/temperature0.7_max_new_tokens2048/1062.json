  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\). We evaluate the use of an exponential transformation defined by the function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\), where C is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), it's impossible to trace back reliably as the transformation \\( e^{Ct} \\) could have scaled the initial state in a complex manner, and this scaled state's evolution under \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) could correspond to multiple possible initial conditions \\( z_0 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z with respect to t causes z, the initial value of z at t=0 causes z at any time t, the constant C causes the transformation g(z), and t causes the application of g(z). The value of z at time T is influenced by z at time t."
