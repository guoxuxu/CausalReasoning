  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a Laplace transform is used to solve the differential equation \\\\( d^2y/dt^2 + 5dy/dt + 6y = 0 \\\\) with specific boundary conditions. The function \\\\( f(y) = L^{-1}(Y(s)e^{-as}) \\\\) is applied where \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of y and a is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time t = t_1, an intervention applying a function \\\\( g(y) = L^{-1}(Y(s)e^{-bs}) \\\\) (where b is a constant different from a) is used, will the resulting function y(T) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original differential equation and not by a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(y) \\\\) further modifies the original state by adding another time shift in the Laplace domain. This results in additional alteration of the trajectory beyond the effects of the original differential equation, making the final state y(T) dependent on a, b, and the coefficients of the differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The second derivative of y with respect to t (d^2y/dt^2) directly influences y, and the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) (L^{-1}(Y(s))) directly produces y. Interventions using L^{-1}(Y(s)e^{-as}) and L^{-1}(Y(s)e^{-bs}) introduce transient responses that depend on a and b respectively, but the steady-state behavior of y after t = t_1 is primarily governed by the original differential equation."
