  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nDoes applying the operator \\\\( D \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before performing the Fourier Transform yield the same result as applying the Fourier Transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) first and then multiplying by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In Fourier Transform theory, differentiating a function in the time domain is equivalent to multiplying its Fourier Transform by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) in the frequency domain due to the properties of the Fourier Transform of derivatives. Hence, applying \\\\( D \\\\) first and then transforming yields the same result as transforming first and then multiplying by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
