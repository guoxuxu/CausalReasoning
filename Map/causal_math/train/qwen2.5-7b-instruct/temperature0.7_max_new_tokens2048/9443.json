  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we analyze the flow of a fluid in a channel influenced by a vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} = k(x,y,z) \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a scalar function of position and \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) is the original velocity field. The fluid properties are altered by a transformation, described by \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla h \\\\), where \\\\( h(x,y,z,t) \\\\) is a scalar field function of space and time.\n\nIf a corrective transformation \\\\( f(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} - \\\\nabla h \\\\) is applied at a later time t1, will the fluid flow at t = T solely reflect the effect of the original vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) and not the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the corrective transformation as an intervention doesn't nullify the initial transformation effect completely due to possible non-linear interactions between the fluid dynamics and the vector field transformations. As such, the state at T remains dependent on the initial transformation as well as the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "k(x,y,z) → v; v → g(v); g(v) → f(v); h(x,y,z,t) → ∇h; ∇h → g(v); f(v) → v(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k(x,y,z) directly influences the vector field v. The vector field v, when transformed by g(v), results in a new vector field that includes the gradient of h. Applying the corrective transformation f(v) removes the gradient of h from the vector field, potentially restoring it to resemble the original velocity field u at time T."
