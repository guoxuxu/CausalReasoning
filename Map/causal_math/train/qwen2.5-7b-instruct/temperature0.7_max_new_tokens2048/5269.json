  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number and the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to this function. The Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) and allowed to transform under Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\), will the resultant transformation be independent of the parameter \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) is dependent on the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) as it directly affects the terms in the exponential within the integral. The result is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-iw} \\\\) showing explicit dependency on \\\\( w \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w influences z(t), which in turn affects the Laplace transform L{z(t)}, while z(0) and t are intermediate factors in determining z(t)."
