  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely exclusively on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention involving \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) influenced by not just \\\\( P \\\\), but also \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\). The exponential transformations can adjust the system’s path and the ultimate position in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
