  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Qx \\\\) at time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, and we analyze its impact over various conditions.\n\nSuppose a different transformation \\\\( k(x) = Rx \\\\) (where R is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend only on M and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The state at time T, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), depends on previous transformations and thus directly on Q and R as well as on M. Both transformations \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) modify the trajectory through their application at different times, thereby influencing the eventual state reached at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state x(T) is causally influenced by M through the differential equation dynamics and by R as an intervention starting at t_1. The transformation Q does not directly affect x(T) in this context."
