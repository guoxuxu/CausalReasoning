  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and \\\\(u\\\\) is the control input. The analysis revolves around the effect of applying a linear feedback control \\\\(u = Kx\\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) observed at time T, can we definitively decide whether the feedback control \\\\(u = Kx\\\\) was applied initially, without further observational data about the system's progression?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) alone does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the presence or absence of the feedback control. Several different control strategies (including \\\\(u = 0\\\\)) could lead to similar final states, especially without details on the intervening trajectory or system response specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the feedback control u = Kx directly influences the state x, and the value of K determines the form of the control input u."
