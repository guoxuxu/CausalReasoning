  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator equation \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\). Analyze how utilizing a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) a constant, affects the system over a time-scale \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(T(x)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(x_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\) only applies a phase shift in the complex plane that does not affect the evolution of the eigenfunctions of L. Since they are only scaled by \\\\(e^{i\\theta}\\\\), the evolution under the operator remains unaffected, preserving the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(x) = e^(iθ)x to x_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under Lx = λx will result in the same x(t) at t=T as directly evolving x_0 under Lx = λx from t=0 to t=T."
