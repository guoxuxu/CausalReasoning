  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the response of a complex system under the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) while iterating through scenarios of system modification or the imposition of a boundary condition.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a new parameter \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) is introduced affecting the system (\\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t}z(t) \\\\)), will the Laplace transform at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) reflect only the changes due to the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) modifies the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through a new oscillatory contribution, making the resulting transform at any future point a composition influenced by both frequencies.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "At time t1, introducing a new parameter ω' affects z'(t), which in turn influences the Laplace transform of z'(t) at time T (where T > t1)."
