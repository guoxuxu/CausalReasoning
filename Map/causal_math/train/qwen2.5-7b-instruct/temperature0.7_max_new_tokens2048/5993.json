  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. This function is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\). We analyze the impact of altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) through an applied transformation \\\\( g(t, z) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real number.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), changing it from \\\\( 1 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\). This changes the trajectory of z over time \\\\( T \\\\) due to the compounded effect of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), resulting in a different form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) which would be \\\\( e^{i (\\\\omega T + \\\\beta T)} \\\\) instead of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega T} \\\\).",
