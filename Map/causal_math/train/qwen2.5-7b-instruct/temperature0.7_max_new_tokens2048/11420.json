  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transformed function after multiple Gaussian convolutions, can we deduce the specific sequence or values of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\sigma' \\\\) just by observing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The specific dampening effects on different frequency components can result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\sigma' \\\\), leading to multiple plausible scenarios that fit the observed data. The non-unique recovery of sequence or values from the Fourier transformed output precludes definitive inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation σ to p(x) and then Fourier transforming it results in a modified Fourier transform of p(x). Similarly, applying a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation σ' to p(x) and then Fourier transforming it results in another modified Fourier transform of p(x)."
