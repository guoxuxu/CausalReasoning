  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We explore the use of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iSt} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where S is a complex constant, to modify z(t).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( H(z) = e^{-iUt}z \\\\) (where U is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent on properties of A, B, C, and D, as well as the effects of S and U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(z) \\\\) introduces additional layers of complexity involving exponential transformations. Hence, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is contingent on the interplay between the linear transformation constants (A, B, C, D) and the exponential effects of both S and U applied at different stages, affecting both amplitude and phase of z(t).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) for T > t_1 depends on the constants A, B, C, and D through their effects on dx/dt and dy/dt, and on S through its effect on T(z), while also being influenced by the application of U in H(z) at t_1."
