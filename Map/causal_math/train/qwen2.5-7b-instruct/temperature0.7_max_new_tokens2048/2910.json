  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transform \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. This scenario explores both the direct evolution of the function and the impact of modifications through an operational function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final output of the transform \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), is it possible to recover the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without confirmation if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) precisely from \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is infeasible because the initial modifications introduced by \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could entirely reshape the integrand and outcome, obscuring the original form and behavior of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves into T(z)(t) through the integral transform, which then becomes T(z)(T) over time. The function z(t) is transformed into T(z)(t) by the integral transform. Applying the function f modifies z to e^(Bt)z. The initial state z_0(t) at t=0 influences z(t) directly."
