  "Problem": "Analyze the complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, in the context of the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) with complex variable s.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is deliberately altered mid-observation to a new value \\\\( \\omega' \\\\), will the final integral transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for any s depend only on the initial \\\\( \\omega \\\\), not on the changed value \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the change in frequency to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) changes the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is being transformed, and thus \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will reflect this change, depending on both the initial segment affected by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the later segment influenced by \\\\( \\omega' \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial angular frequency ω directly influences the function z(t), which in turn affects the integral transform Z(s). Changing ω mid-observation to ω' does not affect the final value of Z(s) once the integral has been computed."
