  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics system where the velocity field is described by \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) and evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 v \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure field and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. We examine the effect of an applied external force \\\\( F(x, t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( F(x, t) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve according to the given fluid dynamics equation without further intervention, will \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no force was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( F(x, t) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions and the subsequent evolution of the velocity field. The force term \\\\( e^{Mt}x \\\\) adds a non-conservative component that alters the velocity field across time, leading to a different state at time T compared to the unforced system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An external force F(x,t) directly influences the velocity field v(x,t); the pressure field p and viscosity ν also directly influence the velocity field v(x,t); time t indirectly affects v(x,t) through its influence on F(x,t); the constant matrix M determines the form of the applied force F(x,t)."
