  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function over time domain t.\n\nGiven the transformed function in the s-domain post both the Laplace transform and the shifting intervention, can we uniquely determine the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the shift \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the transformed function, now at \\\\( s = a + i\\\\omega \\\\), allows us to uniquely determine both the shift \\\\( a \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by decomposing the real and imaginary parts of the pole.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
