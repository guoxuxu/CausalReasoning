  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined over the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}s \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The transformation by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformatoin results \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine if the intervention of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) was performed?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integrative and exponential nature of \\\\( T \\\\), multiple combinations of modifications (like addition of a term \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\)) could potentially lead to the same endpoint result. The overlapping effects and possible phase cancellations or contributions of exponential terms make it indeterminate to clearly characterize the interventions just by observing \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
