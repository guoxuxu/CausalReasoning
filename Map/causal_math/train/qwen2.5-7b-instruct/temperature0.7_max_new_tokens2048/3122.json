  "Problem": "Let's consider the probability density function \\( p(z) \\) that describes the distribution of a random variable \\( Z \\) undergoing the Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(z)e^{-i\\omega z} dz \\). We investigate how transformations in the time domain and frequency domain affect this PDF.\n\nGiven \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) = e^{-i\\omega a}\\hat{p}(\\omega) \\), can we deduce the value of \\( a \\) properly without knowing the form of \\( p(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the value of \\( a \\) uniquely from \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) \\) requires knowledge about the baseline function \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\). Without knowing \\( p(z) \\), multiple values of \\( a \\) could theoretically correspond to the observed changes in \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) \\), precluding accurate back-calculation of \\( a \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The probability density function p(z) transforms into the Fourier domain to produce the probability density function hat{p}(ω), which then undergoes a phase shift to become hat{q}(ω)."
