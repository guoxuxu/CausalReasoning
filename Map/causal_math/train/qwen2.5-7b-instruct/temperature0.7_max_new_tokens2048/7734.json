  "Problem": "Consider a linear canonical transformation system governed by complex function integration \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} w(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and w(t) represents an external input function. We explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( h(w) = \\\\int e^{Bt} w(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can the original input function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) be precisely recovered knowing that either \\\\( w(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied, but not which?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of an unknown transformation applied to the input function complicates backward calculations. Without explicit knowledge of whether \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied, recovering \\\\( w(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) uniquely is not feasible due to the integral transformation potentially modifying the original temporal characteristics of \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original input function w(t) directly influences z(t), and the integral transformation h(w) directly influences h(w(t)). Knowing z(T) and either w(t) or h(w) allows for the potential recovery of the original input function w(t), though it is not specified which one provides sufficient information alone."
