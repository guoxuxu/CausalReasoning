  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), where \\( t \\) is time. We evaluate the integration of this function transformed by a differential operator \\( D \\) such that \\( Dz = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}z \\), for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\) after applying both \\( D \\) for \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( E \\) for \\( m = 1 \\) at different times before \\( T \\), can we precisely determine which operations were applied at what times just by observing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\( z(T) \\) could result from various combinations and sequences of applying \\( D \\) and \\( E \\), especially since both operators for \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\) produce the first derivative but at different times. This makes it difficult to uniquely determine the history of operations applied.",
