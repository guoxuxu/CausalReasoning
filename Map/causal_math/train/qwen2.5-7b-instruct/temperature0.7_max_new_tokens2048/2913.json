  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function transformation on real function space, considering the integral transform \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\). The analysis focuses on the Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf performing a Fourier transform on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( F(a)(x) = \\\\frac{1}{a + ix} \\\\), will applying the transform on the same \\\\( f(t) \\\\) always yield the same output if there is no intervention in the system?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) being deterministic and depend solely on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) under constant conditions of \\\\( a \\\\) and without any external intervention maintains consistent results.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) = e^(-at) transforms to F(a)(x) = 1 / (a + ix) through the Fourier transformation, and this transformation is consistent given the same input f(t) without any intervention."
