  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We are also interested in the effect of a transformation represented by the operator \\\\( P(t) = e^{Mt} \\\\), with M being another constant operator. This transformation is applied to the initial condition prior to evolution under the system's dynamics.\n\nIf we can observe the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine specifically what interventions were made (whether \\\\( P(t) \\\\), \\\\( Q(t) \\\\), or both), based solely on knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used based on the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is complicated by the potential overlapping effects of \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\). These transformations can result in multiple, indistinguishable trajectories that yield the same endpoint, confounding precise isolation of the interventions employed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of operators P(t) or Q(t) transforms the initial condition, which then evolves under the dynamics defined by L to produce the state x(T) at time T."
