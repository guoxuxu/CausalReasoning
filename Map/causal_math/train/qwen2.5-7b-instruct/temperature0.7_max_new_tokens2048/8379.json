  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system having an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). An operator \\\\( G \\\\) defined by \\\\( Gx(t) = x(t - \\tau) \\\\) acts as a delay of \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds on the input.\n\nSuppose another operator \\\\( F \\\\) which performs amplification by a factor \\\\( a \\\\) is applied after \\\\( G \\\\) is used on the input signal. Will the final output only reflect the combined effects linearly, i.e., first the delay by \\\\( G \\\\) followed by amplification by \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operations of \\\\( G \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) are linear transformations. \\\\( F(Gx(t)) = ax(t - \\tau) \\\\), and thus when convoluted with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it results in an output amplified by \\\\( a \\\\) and delayed by \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds: \\\\( y(t) = a(x(t - \\tau) * h)(t) = a(x * h)(t - \\tau) \\\\. This showcases the linearity and sequential application of effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) causally influences the system output y(t) through the convolution with the impulse response h(t). Applying the delay operator G to x(t) results in x(t - τ), which then gets amplified by F to become a * x(t - τ). The sequence of operations first delays the input by G and then amplifies it by F, affecting the final output."
