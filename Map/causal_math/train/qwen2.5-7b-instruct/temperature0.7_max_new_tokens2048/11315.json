  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a diagonal matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf an additional integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied at an intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), depend only on the original differential equation and not on the application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or \\\\( T(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) introduces an external influence on the system's evolution, impacting the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) along with the initial modification by \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This makes the final state a product of the matrix M, the integral transformation, and the initial application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state x(T) depends on the original differential equation M → x(t) and the integral transformation T(x) → x(T). The function z(t) does not directly influence x(T) when considering only the given transformations."
