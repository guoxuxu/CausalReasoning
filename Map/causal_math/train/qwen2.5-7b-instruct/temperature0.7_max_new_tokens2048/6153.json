  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by a matrix equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We study the system's behavior under a transformation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Ct}x\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is another constant matrix, and how interventions using matrix \\\\(D\\\\) affect the solution.\n\nIf \\\\(x(t)\\\\) transformation is applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to a vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) leading to the condition \\\\(Ax(t) = b\\\\) without further intervention, will the solution of \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) still satisfy the original system \\\\(Ax_0 = b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Ct}x_0\\\\) changes the condition significantly since the transformed vector at time \\\\(T\\\\), given by \\\\(x(T) = e^{CT}x_0\\\\), will typically not satisfy \\\\(Ax_0 = b\\\\) unless \\\\(e^{CT}\\\\) commutes with \\\\(A\\\\) in a way that \\\\(Ax(T)\\\\) still equals \\\\(b\\\\), which generally is not the case.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x(0) transforms over time t to x(t) through the action of matrix C, and at time T, x(T) represents the state of x(t) at that moment. Matrix A and vector b define the original system such that for x(0), Ax(0) = b holds true, but this does not guarantee that after transformation, x(T) will still satisfy Ax_0 = b unless D does not alter the relationship between A and b."
