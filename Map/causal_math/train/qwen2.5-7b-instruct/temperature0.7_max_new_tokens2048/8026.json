  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in two-dimensional space over time. We analyze how the system behaves under the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes ambiguous. The transformation could have modified the phase and magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) differently based on the real and imaginary parts of A. Hence, multiple potential initial conditions might converge to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The position z(T) at time T is influenced by the initial position z_0, the complex constant A, and time t. Specifically, A and t together determine z(T) through the transformation f(z) = e^(At)z."
