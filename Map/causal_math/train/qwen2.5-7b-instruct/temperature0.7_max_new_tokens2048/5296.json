  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nGiven a spectrum obtained from a Fourier Transform indicating a primary peak at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we conclude which specific interventions, such as amplitude scaling or phase shifting, were applied to the time-domain signal \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), based solely on the spectrum at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum shows the presence of the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but does not specifically reveal whether an amplitude scaling or a phase shifting intervention was applied. Both interventions alter the spectrum in ways that are not distinguishable purely based on the peak at \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
