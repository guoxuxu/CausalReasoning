  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a transformation on a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex number. The transformation is defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant and t is time.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be determined from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the transformation could have altered both magnitude and phase, which are not discernible from the final observed state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
