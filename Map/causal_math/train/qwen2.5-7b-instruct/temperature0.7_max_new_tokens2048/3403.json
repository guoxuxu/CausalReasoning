  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with D being a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the function at initial time t = 0, namely \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made at time t = t' > 0, such as multiplying \\\\( u(x, t') \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t' be solely dependent on D and not on the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the state of the system at t = t', and this modification impacts the subsequent transformation and evolution of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The Fourier transform of this modified state would depend not only on D but also significantly on the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion coefficient D influences the rate of change of u with respect to time, which in turn influences the second derivative of u with respect to space. The initial condition u(x, 0) determines the Fourier transform at t=0, while multiplying u(x, t') by g(x) at t=t' affects the subsequent evolution of u but does not change its dependence on D for the Fourier transform at later times T > t'."
