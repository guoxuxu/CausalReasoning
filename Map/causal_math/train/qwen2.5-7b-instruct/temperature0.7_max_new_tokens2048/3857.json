  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, subjected to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) over time t, where S is a complex constant. We are analyzing how this transformation interacts with the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is another complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling and rotating the vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\), depending on the real and imaginary parts of S. This change in initial conditions results in a different trajectory under the differential equation, leading to a different state at time T.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) applied at t=0 results in z(t), which evolves over time according to Mz, leading to z(T) at t=T. Direct evolution of z(0) under the differential equation Mz from t=0 to t=T also leads to z(T). Therefore, the state of z(T) after applying f(z) and evolving under Mz is equivalent to directly evolving z(0) under Mz."
