  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a set of linear algebraic equations driven by a matrix function \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\), where A is a diagonalizable matrix. We further examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At}X(t) dt \\\\) on the system.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( X(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify which transformations (\\\\( g(X) \\\\), \\\\( h(X) \\\\), or both) were applied during the time [0, T] based solely on the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant matrix \\\\( X(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various sequences and combinations of transformations due to the combined influence and non-trivial effects of exponential matrix functions and integral transformations working over different intervals. This complexity makes it infeasible to determine the exact path or types of transformations applied only from observing \\\\( X(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state X(t) at time t directly influences the final state X(T) at time T. The matrix A determines the evolution of X(t) over time. Applying the integral transformation g(X) results in the final state X(T)."
