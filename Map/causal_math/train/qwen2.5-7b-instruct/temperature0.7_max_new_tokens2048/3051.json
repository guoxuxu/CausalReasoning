  "Problem": "Let us consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z' = i \\omega z\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function of time, \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\(T(z) = z e^{i \\theta t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is a constant real shift in frequency.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(S(z) = z e^{-i \\theta t}\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the original system's frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\theta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(S(z)\\\\) reintroduces or negates frequency shifts introduced by \\\\(T(z)\\\\), directly affecting the trajectory and frequency of the system's evolution. Therefore, the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends not only on \\\\(\\omega\\\\) but also on the effect of both \\\\(\\theta\\\\) shifts.",
