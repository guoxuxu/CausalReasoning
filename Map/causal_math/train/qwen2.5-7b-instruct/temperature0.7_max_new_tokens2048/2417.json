  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(p\\\\) is a control function. The system's transformation is analyzed using the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nIf the control function \\\\( p \\\\) is set as a constant value at t = 0 and allowed to evolve according to the differential equation without further changes, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at some s = S be the same as if p was varied over time?",
  "Explanation": "The constant control function leads to a specific form of the solution which, under the Laplace transform, results in a unique expression in the s-domain reflecting the constant input. If p changes over time, it alters the differential equation's inhomogeneity, leading to a different transformation under Laplace, indicated by variations in the s-domain representation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
