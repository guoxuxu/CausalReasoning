  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the impact of the linear operator \\\\( L \\{z\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform, on this function over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied without any intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( L\\{z\\}(s) \\\\) be affected solely by the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( L\\{z\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s > 0 \\\\). The outcome is solely dependent on the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), as the transform directly relates to the function's defining characteristics without any external modification.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
