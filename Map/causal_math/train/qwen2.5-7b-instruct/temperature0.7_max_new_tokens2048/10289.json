  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) which is a complex exponential representing oscillatory behavior with a constant \\\\( C \\\\) and angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\). An operator \\\\( T \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as follows: \\\\( Tz(t) = z(t + h) \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a time-shift constant.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 and the function evolves naturally without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the operator \\\\( T \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( T \\\\) introduces a time shift to the function, which alters the phase of the complex exponential by \\\\( e^{i\\omega h} \\\\) at each point. This change permanently shifts all subsequent states of the system, leading to a different state at any time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator T to z(t) at t=0 shifts the function by h units of time, transforming z(0) into z(h). Without applying T, z(t) remains unchanged as it evolves naturally."
