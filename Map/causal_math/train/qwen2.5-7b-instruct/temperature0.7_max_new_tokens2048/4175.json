  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\), where s is a complex variable. We advance to analyze the system transformed by the Laplace transform with respect to s, denoted by \\\\( L \\\\{ z(s) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf after taking Laplace transform, an operation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) represented by multiplication with another function is applied, will the resulting transform describe a mere product of transforms without the effect of complex integration?",
  "Explanation": "Performing an operation such as multiplication after the Laplace transform alters the resulting Laplace domain expression in a way that reflects convolution in the time domain, not simply product. This entails complex integration procedures, indicating dependency on both the nature of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and the Laplace transform properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z(s) is transformed by the Laplace transform to L{z(s)}, then G(s) modifies L{z(s)} through multiplication, resulting in the final transform."
