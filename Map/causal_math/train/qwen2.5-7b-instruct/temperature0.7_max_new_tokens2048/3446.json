  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) encompasses dynamics given by the matrix A. We explore the influence of modifying the function through multiplication by a matrix exponential \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) where B is another constant matrix.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at s = 0, can we conclude the presence of B or deduce the form of \\\\( B \\\\) knowing that \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was not evolved purely according to A?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at s = 0 provides information integrated over the entire function of t, making it challenging to distinctly attribute modifications to B without additional information about the commutation properties of A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix B influences the function g(t), which in turn affects H(s). The matrix A influences f(t), and since B is different from A, g(t) is not the same as f(t). Knowing H(s) at s=0 does not directly reveal the presence of B or its form."
