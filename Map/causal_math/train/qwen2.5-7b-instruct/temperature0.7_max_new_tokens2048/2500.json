  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system governed by a vector field \\\\(V(z) = i\\\\beta z\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant. The transformation considered is \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, and t represents time.\n\nBased on the final position \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (\\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied, knowing only \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), even with the same endpoint, might result from differing sequences or magnitudes of interventions, especially given the complex exponential effects that influence both magnitude and rotational aspects of z. This overlap in potential effects makes uniquely identifying the interventions impossible based on the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Time t directly influences the final position z(T) through the transformation f(z). The constant α directly influences z(T) through the same transformation f(z). The constant β does not directly influence z(T) since it is not part of the transformation f(z) but rather defines the vector field V(z)."
