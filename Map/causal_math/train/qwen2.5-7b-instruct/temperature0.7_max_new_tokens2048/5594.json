  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a system in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P + iQ)z \\\\), with real matrices P and Q. Examine the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{(C + iD)t}z \\\\), where C and D are also real matrices.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we accurately reverse-engineer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduces complexity due to the possibly non-commuting nature of exponential terms \\\\( e^{(C + iD)t} \\\\) and the differential operator \\\\( (P + iQ) \\\\). Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) directly causes changes in z(t). The differential equation P + iQ directly causes the evolution of z(t). The initial state z_0 directly causes the value of z(t). The transformation C + iD directly causes the effect on z(t) through f(z)."
