  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = -RI + E(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, I is the current, and E(t) is a time-varying electromotive force. An analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of adding a linear filter \\\\( f(I) = CI \\\\) where C is a constant, initially at time t = 0.\n\nIf a reverse filter \\\\( g(I) = \\\\frac{1}{D}I \\\\) (where D is a constant) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the differential equation and not on the filters C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the reverse filter introduces a competing effect, altering the current further and causing the final state \\\\( I(T) \\\\) to depend on both the initial filter C and the intervention D. The dynamics are thus affected by both transformations, as well as the governing differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resistance R and time-varying electromotive force E(t) directly cause current I; introduction of filter C at initial time affects I but is irrelevant after t_1; introducing reverse filter D at t_1 causes changes in I after that time."
