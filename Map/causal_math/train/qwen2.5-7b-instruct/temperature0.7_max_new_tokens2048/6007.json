  "Problem": "Study a system governed by \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants, and consider the integration through a transform \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) applied to the variable \\( z = x + iy \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nSuppose an intervention applies a new transformation \\( S(z) = z^2 \\) at some point \\( z_1 \\) resulting from \\( T(z) \\) from a starting \\( z \\) that satisfies \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\). Will \\( S(z_1) = z_1^2 \\) necessarily satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The double application of transformations \\( z^3 \\) followed by \\( z^2 \\) greatly modifies the original properties and relations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\( z \\), disrupting satisfaction with \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\) unless very specific conditions are met, which are generally not expected.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(z) maps z to z1, then applying S(z1) results in z1_squared, which is used to check if it satisfies ax^2 + by^2 = c."
