  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. A linear transformation by a complex matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function, resulting in \\\\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and the system is allowed to evolve under the dynamics specified by \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as the trajectory of \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) directly computed for each t?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is linear and constant, and it commutes with the time evolution operator of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the trajectory \\\\( w(t) \\\\) will exactly follow \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) for all t, yielding the same trajectory when applied post-evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( z(t) \\) directly influences \\( w(t) \\) through the linear transformation \\( M \\). The initial state \\( z(0) \\) determines \\( z(t) \\), and \\( M \\) transforms \\( z(t) \\) into \\( w(t) \\) and also directly into \\( Mz(t) \\).
