  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants. We investigate how the application of an input signal function transformed by \\\\( g(t) = e^{dt} \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) impacts the output over time.\n\nIf an input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( g(t) = e^{dt}x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then processed through the circuit described by \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was directly processed without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies the input signal by scaling it exponentially, which changes the frequency content of the signal. This altered input, when processed by the circuit, results in a different output compared to the unmodified input due to the frequency-dependent nature of the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(t) = e^(dt)x(t) to the input x(t) at t=0 before passing it through the circuit described by H(s) results in an output y(t) that is different from directly processing x(t) through H(s) at t=T."
