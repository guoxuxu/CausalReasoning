  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex variable. We explore the effect of modifying the system using a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming the original to \\\\( y'(t) = (y * h)(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\), the transformed Laplace transform, can we precisely determine \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) if we do not know \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\), one cannot uniquely determine \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) from \\\\( Y'(s) = Y(s)H(s) \\\\) because any number of functions \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) can produce the same product, making it indeterminate.",
