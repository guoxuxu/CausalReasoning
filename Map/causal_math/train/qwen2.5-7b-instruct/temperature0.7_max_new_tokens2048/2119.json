  "Problem": "Consider a functional equation \\\\( v(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(x,t)u(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input function. The transformation applied is \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention changes the kernel function from \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) to \\\\( K'(x,t) = K(x,t) + H(x,t) \\\\) (where \\\\( H(x,t) \\\\) is another kernel function) at some point, will the transformed output \\\\( w(x) \\\\) at x = X be solely dependent on the new kernel function \\\\( K'(x,t) \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output after the intervention, \\\\( w(x) \\\\), which results from the modified kernel function \\\\( K'(x,t) \\\\), depends on both the original function \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) and the intervention function \\\\( H(x,t) \\\\). The new output is influenced by the cumulative effects of both kernels on the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\), hence not solely dependent on \\\\( K'(x,t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of v(x) depends on K(x,t), and since w(x) = v(x) + c, changing K(x,t) to K'(x,t) affects v(x) but also w(x). However, the change in w(x) at x=X due to the intervention is primarily driven by the change in K(x,t) to K'(x,t), with the constant c remaining unchanged."
