  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\), aiming to analyze the consequences of employing a time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t) \\) where \\( \\\\alpha \\) is a scaling factor.\n\nIf we have the Laplace Transform of \\(g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t)\\), can we uniquely determine \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\\\alpha\\) just from \\(L(g)(s)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\(L(g)(s)\\) provides the transformed function scaled by \\(\\\\alpha\\), but it does not provide enough information to uniquely determine both \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\\\alpha\\) without additional constraints or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform of f(t) (L(f)(s)) determines the Laplace Transform of g(t) (L(g)(s)); g(t) is a scaled version of f(t) by a factor of α; α scales the argument of f(t) to generate g(t); knowing L(g)(s) allows us to infer properties about f(t) and α, but unique determination of both f(t) and α may not be possible without additional information."
