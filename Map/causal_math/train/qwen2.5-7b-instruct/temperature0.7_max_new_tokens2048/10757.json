  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a positive constant related to eigenvalues. The solution space is transformed via the Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\). The impact of computation methods such as numerical integration is also explored.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and then the resulting form is inverted using \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) back to the spatio-temporal domain, will the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) for t > 0 still solve the original partial differential equation without any external intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform and its inverse are linear operations that preserve the properties of the differential equation. Since the operations are inverses of each other, they don't alter the function beyond transformation and back-transformation. Therefore, \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) still satisfies the original equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) directly influences the solution u(x,t) at later times t > 0 through the Fourier transform F and its inverse F^{-1}. Applying F to u(x,0) and then F^{-1} returns a function that still satisfies the original partial differential equation."
