  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time Markov chain with state space \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\) governed by the transition rate matrix \\\\(Q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -\\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\). We are investigating the effect of modifying transition rates with a scalar function \\\\(f(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transition rates are scaled by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) initially at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the original Markov process without further intervention, will the probability of being in state 2 at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if no scaling was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the transition rates by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) modifies the rates \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\lambda e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\), respectively. This alteration changes the dynamics of the Markov chain, affecting the state probabilities at any future time \\\\(t = T\\\\) different from the unmodified system.",

List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The scaling factor f(t) does not directly cause changes in the probability of being in state 2 at time T, as the Markov process continues to evolve according to its original transition rates after scaling."
