  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under a linear transformation described by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) applied on the vector representation \\\\( (x, y) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(u) du \\) is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation defined by a matrix \\\\( B \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and we observe \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), will this outcome depend solely on the transformations \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new transformation matrix \\\\( B \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) imparts a new behavior on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting its trajectory and therefore the resultant integral \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\. As a result, the outcome will depend on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), reflecting their combined influence on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
