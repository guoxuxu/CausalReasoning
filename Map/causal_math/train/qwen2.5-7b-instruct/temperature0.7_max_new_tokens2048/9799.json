  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^s ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter representing time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an operation modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z^2 \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) remain unaffected by the early transformation of \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z^2 \\\\) influences the integrand, fundamentally changing the course of the integral due to the alteration in the powers of \\\\( z \\\\). This significantly impacts the resulting function's properties and values at any later time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "At time t1, modifying z to z^2 directly affects g(z). The final form of g(z) at T > t1 will be affected by the transformation of z at t1."
