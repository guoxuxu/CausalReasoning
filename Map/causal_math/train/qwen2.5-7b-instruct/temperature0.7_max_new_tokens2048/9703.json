  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the influence of the integral transformation defined by \\\\\\( F[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf a modification \\\\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\\\) (where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a real constant) is introduced as an intervention at a specific time \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\), will the final expression of \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) for \\\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\\\) depend solely on the original frequency \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) without influence from \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\\\( g(t) \\\\\\) changes the exponential decay rate and alters the frequency characteristics of the time-domain signal. Thus, the final expression of \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) is a result of both the original frequency \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of the modification g(t) → z(t) does not directly cause changes in z(T) for T > t1, thus z(T) depends solely on ω without influence from α."
