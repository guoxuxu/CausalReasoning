  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = {\\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sA} x(s) ds} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function defined by some physical or chemical process. We assess the effect of the linear operator \\\\( L(z) = Bz \\\\), with B being another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the outcome at any time t be equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without application of \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) modifies the initial expression to \\\\( Bz(0) \\\\), thus altering the solution trajectory. The multiplication by matrix B affects the integration outcome differently than if it were just \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving under its original definition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function x(t) and constant matrix A determine z(t); applying the linear operator L with matrix B to z(t) changes z(t); this modification through L affects the evolution of z(t) over time."
