  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\). We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) over time t, where k is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of k, m, and t_1 can yield the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the scalability and rotational symmetry in complex exponential transformations. This ambiguity and overlap in potential transformations make it difficult to uniquely determine the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
