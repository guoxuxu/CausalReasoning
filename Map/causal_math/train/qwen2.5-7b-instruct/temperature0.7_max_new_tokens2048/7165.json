  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real variables. This function is subjected to a Laplace Transformation over the variable \\\\( t \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency domain variable.\n\nIf the initial expression \\\\( z(x, 0) = e^{ax} \\\\) is evolved over time to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under the given complex function without any intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, T)\\\\} \\\\) still only depend on \\\\( s \\\\) and not on \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) at any time \\\\( T \\\\) results in a function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), which is independent of \\\\( T \\\\) because the dependency on \\\\( t \\\\) is accounted for in the transform and reflected in the denominator \\\\( s - b \\\\).",
