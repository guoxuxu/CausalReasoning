  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The function is analyzed in terms of its effects on integration along a contour in the complex plane. The path of integration, \\\\( C \\\\), is defined from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) dz \\\\), can we infer the starting point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of the contour \\\\( C \\\\) without extra information about function \\\\( Z(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) dz \\\\) depends on both the path and the function \\\\( Z(z) \\\\). Without precise knowledge of \\\\( Z(z) \\\\) or the nature of \\\\( C \\\\), deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_1 \\\\) just from the integral's value is not feasible, owing to the complex transformation dynamics of \\\\( Z(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function Z(z) influences the value of the integral, the path of integration C determines the integral's value, and the starting point z_0 defines the path C."
