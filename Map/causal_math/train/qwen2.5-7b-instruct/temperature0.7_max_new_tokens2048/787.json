  "Problem": "Examine the relationship in a closed economic system represented by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input economic variable, C is a constant matrix defining the transformation from input to output, and D is a rate matrix governing the system's dynamics over time t.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system with a new function \\\\( h(x) = x + e^{Ft}x \\\\), where F is another constant matrix, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still be predictable solely based on the initial matrices A and C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics through \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\), significantly altering the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and thus impacting the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Consequently, the final output becomes dependent on F along with A, C, and D, complicating the predictable influence of the original matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
