  "Problem": "Examine the influence of a nonlinear transformation \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant, on a discrete dynamical system \\\\( w_{n+1} = z(w_n) \\\\). Evaluate how these changes affect the behavior of sequences generated by this dynamic system over iterations.\n\nGiven the final state of a sequence after multiple iterations, including known interventions of modifying constants, can the sequence's initial state and all intervening constants be accurately reconstructed?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters typical in nonlinear dynamical systems like iterated quadratic maps, small variations can lead to diverging sequences. Accurately reconstructing the initial state and all changes in constants from the final state is generally not feasible without additional constraining information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state w_n, through the nonlinear transformation z(w_n) which depends on the complex constant c, determines the subsequent states w_{n+1}. Modifying the constant c changes the transformation z(w_n), thereby affecting the sequence's behavior."
