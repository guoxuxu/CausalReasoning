  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow through a variable area duct governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} = -a(x)Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) represents the flow rate and \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a variable coefficient dependent on the position \\\\( x \\\\). We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(Q) = e^{Bx}Q \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(Q) \\\\) is applied to a flow rate \\\\( Q_0 \\\\) at x = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} = -a(x)Q \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( Q(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( Q_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to x = X under \\\\( \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} = -a(x)Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(Q) \\\\) modifies the initial flow rate, changing the starting conditions of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Bx} \\\\) affects the magnitude of \\\\( Q(x) \\\\) initially, the evolution under the differential equation will take a different trajectory compared to the unmodified initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(Q) = e^(Bx)Q to the initial flow rate Q_0 at x=0 and then allowing it to evolve according to dQ/dx = -a(x)Q results in a different Q(x) at x=X compared to directly evolving Q_0 to x=X under the same differential equation."
