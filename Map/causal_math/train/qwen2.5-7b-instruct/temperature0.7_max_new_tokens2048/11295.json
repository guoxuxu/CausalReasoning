  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Suppose we apply the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) periodically at times \\\\(t_n = nT\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is an integer and \\\\(T\\\\) a constant interval.\n\nIf after some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a constant) is applied, will the system's state at any future time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be influenced only by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive applying of transformations introduces additional scaling factors at different times, which influence the magnitude and phase rotation of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). This results in a system behavior at time \\\\(T\\\\) that is dependent not only on the original differential equation parameter \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) but also significantly on transformations \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), each contributing to the overall state evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The system's state at any future time T > t1 is influenced by ω through the differential equation, and indirectly by α and β through the transformations g(z) and h(z), but the direct influence of α and β on the state after applying h(z) at t1 is minimal compared to ω."
