  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) as a signal through a linear system described by the transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-ix}z(x)dx \\\\). We explore the causal inference ability by analyzing the system's response using advanced calculus and integral transformations.\n\nCan we precisely identify if a modulation function \\\\( m(t) \\\\) was applied before the transformation and determine its form, just by analyzing the output \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the inherent properties of integral transforms and possible equivalence in outcomes from different initial functions or modulation applications, it's impossible to uniquely backtrack and determine the precise characteristics or existence of the intervention function \\\\( m(t) \\\\) based only on \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If a modulation function m(t) is applied before transformation to produce z(t), then analyzing the output T(z) can help identify m(t). However, the reverse relation T(z) → m(t) is not directly causal but rather involves inferring m(t) from T(z)."
