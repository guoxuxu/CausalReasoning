  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation governing heat distribution \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with initial heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\). An operation \\\\(g(u) = e^{wt}u\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(w\\) is a constant, which alters the heat distribution dynamically.\n\nObserving the heat distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, is it possible to determine whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied at t=0 or if the distribution merely evolved from \\\\(f(x)\\\\) under \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\) without any transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the heat distribution at time T and without additional information, it is impossible to ascertain whether the initial condition was scaled by \\\\(e^{wt}\\\\). The distribution could result from various initial conditions given the nature of heat diffusion expressing multiple possible precursors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial heat distribution u(x, 0) directly influences the heat distribution u(x, T) at time T. The operation g(u) applied to u(x, 0) also directly influences u(x, T), leading to a different distribution at time T compared to the evolution of u(x, 0) under the heat equation u_t = ku_{xx}."
