  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a Hermitian matrix and i is the imaginary unit, defining oscillatory dynamics. We explore the consequences of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "It is impossible to uniquely backtrack the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without clear knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), as the transformation influenced by B could have altered initial conditions significantly compared to the hypothetical unaffected pathway (purely under \\\\( iAz \\\\)). The introduction of phase changes by B obscures the historical trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(z) = e^(Bt)z results in the state z(T) at time T; the matrix A governs the rate of change of z as \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\); the matrix B also governs the rate of change of z as \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Be^Bt z \\\\). Knowing z(T) alone is insufficient to determine the original state z_0 without additional information about the transformation or the initial conditions."
