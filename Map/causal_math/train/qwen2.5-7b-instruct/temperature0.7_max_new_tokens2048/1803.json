  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as a complex exponential \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which undergoes transformations under various operations mapped in a complex function space. The transformations are represented by the operators \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Lz(t) = e^{kt}z(t) \\\\) for some real constant k, and \\\\( M \\\\) as \\\\( Mz(t) = e^{ht}z(t) \\\\) with h being another real constant.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the operator \\\\( M \\\\) is introduced as an intervention on the system that was initially influenced by \\\\( L \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the effects of L and not M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\( M \\\\) further transforms the system to \\\\( e^{(i+k+h)t} \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T is influenced by both k and h, the factors in operators L and M, making the outcome dependent on both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final form of z(T) for T > t1 relies on both the effects of L and M because M introduces an intervention at t1, modifying z(t1) to z(t2) which then further transforms under L."
