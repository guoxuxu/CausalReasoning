  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), which is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. The effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both were used based solely on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex because different combinations of P, Q, and R can yield the same endpoint due to the properties of exponential transformations in the complex plane. The similar outcomes from various transformation sequences render it impossible to uniquely backtrack to the specific interventions that were used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
