  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing application where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( X(f) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). The transformed signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by a frequency response \\\\( H(f) \\\\). We are particularly interested in the impact of modifying the signal processing steps with the inclusion of an inverse Fourier transform defined by \\\\( x'(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\{X'(f)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filter \\\\( G(f) \\\\) is used as an intervention after \\\\( H(f) \\\\) has been applied, and before inverse transforming to \\\\( x''(t) \\\\), will the result \\\\( x''(t) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( G(f) \\\\) and not on \\\\( H(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result in the time domain, \\\\( x''(t) \\\\), will be influenced by both \\\\( H(f) \\\\) and \\\\( G(f) \\\\) due to the successive application of these filters. The output signal \\\\( x''(t) \\\\) reflects the cumulative effect of both filters as their product modifies the original spectrum \\\\( X(f) \\\\) before the inverse transformation.",
