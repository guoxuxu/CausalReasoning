  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a Laplace transform used on a physical system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, \\\\( x \\\\) is the position, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( L(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) is considered.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 undergoes the heat equation evolution without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at any later time t simply represent the natural evolution of \\\\( L(u_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the temperature distribution over time involves an integral transformation influencing the entire function space of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\). The initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) contributes to, but does not fully determine, the transformed function due to the ongoing adjustment of the temperature via the heat distribution equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u_0 directly causes the temperature distribution u, and the Laplace transform of u_0 directly causes the Laplace transform of u. The heat equation evolution from u_0 to u does not change the Laplace transform L(u_0) directly; instead, L(u_0) represents the Laplace transform of the natural evolution of u."
