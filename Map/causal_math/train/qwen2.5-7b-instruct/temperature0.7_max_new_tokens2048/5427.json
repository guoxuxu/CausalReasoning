  "Problem": "Given the complex function defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), assess the effect of a contour integration transformation where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) traces a path specified by functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the complex plane from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the path \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) to a differentiable function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), will the resulting integral from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) solely reflect this change without influence from the original path?",
  "Explanation": "The integral result will be influenced by both the original path and the altered trajectory due to the intervention. Contributions to the integral from both segments \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) contribute to the final result, leading to a superposition effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying the path z'(t) at t = t_1 changes the value of g(z'(t)), which is independent of the original path z(t) for t ≠ t_1."
