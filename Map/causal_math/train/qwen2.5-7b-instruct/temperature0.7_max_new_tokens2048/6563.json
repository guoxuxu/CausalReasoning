  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing model driven by a linear time-invariant system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) governed by its Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. The impact of a Fourier transform modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) on the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of an additional filtering process characterized by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+b} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant, is introduced at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the original system characteristics \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on the modulation \\\\( m(t) \\\\) or the intervention filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) alters the system's characteristics by introducing an additional dynamic. The final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the initial system's response, the modulation effect, and the characteristics of the intervention filter, reflecting the compositional interaction between these elements.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The output y(T) for T > t1 is influenced by H(s) through h(t) and is also affected by G(s) introduced at t1, but it does not depend exclusively on H(s) without considering the effects of G(s)."
