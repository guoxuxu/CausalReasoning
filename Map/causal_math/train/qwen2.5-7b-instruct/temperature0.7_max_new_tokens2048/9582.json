  "Problem": "Consider a function $z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}$ where $i$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is a real frequency parameter. We analyze the effect of a differential operator $D = \\frac{d}{dt}$ on the function over time $t$, and consider the impact of linear transformations such as $L(z) = az + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers.\n\nCan we deduce the original function $z(t)$ at $t=0$ after observing $z(T)$, without knowing whether $L(z)$ was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Simply knowing $z(T)$ does not provide enough information to conclude if the transformation $L(z)$ was applied or not, as multiple combinations of $a$ and $b$ can lead to the same observed outcome depending on their interaction with $e^{i\\omega T}$. Without this data, we cannot trace back to an unambiguous original state.",
