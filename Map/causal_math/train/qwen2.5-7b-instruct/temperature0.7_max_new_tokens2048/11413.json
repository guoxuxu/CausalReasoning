  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We evaluate its behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwt_0} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the original rule without further manipulation, will \\\\( z(t) = e^{3iwt} \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwt_0} \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) modifies the function to evolve as \\\\( z(t) = (e^{iwt})^3 = e^{3iwt} \\\\), which differs from the natural progression \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) at any non-zero \\\\( t \\\\). This cubic transformation accelerates the phase rotation by a factor of three.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w influences z(t) through its exponential relationship. t_0 determines the initial state z_0, which then evolves to z(t) over time t. Applying f(z) to z_0 results in a different z(t) compared to evolving z_0 directly to z(t) without transformation."
