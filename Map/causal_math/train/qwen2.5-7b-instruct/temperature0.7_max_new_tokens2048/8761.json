  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the current I(t) depends on the applied voltage V(t) through the differential equation \\\\(L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. Analyze different scenarios when mathematical transformations are applied to the voltage by a function \\\\(g(V) = e^{st}V\\\\) representing a scaling of the voltage by an exponential function over time t, where s is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\(g(V)\\\\) is applied to the initial voltage condition at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to the given differential equation without further intervention, will the current I(t) at time T be the same as if the initial voltage V(t) were applied directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(V)\\\\) to the voltage modifies the entire response of the system. The exponential scaling changes the effective voltage input, resulting in variations in current dynamics due to the nature of the coupled equations, affecting the charging rate of the capacitor and current evolution through the inductor and resistor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the exponential scaling function g(V) to the initial voltage V(t) results in a modified voltage that, when used in the differential equation, affects the current I(t) at time T differently than applying the original voltage V(t) directly."
