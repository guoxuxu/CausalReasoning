  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in terms of spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(U(p, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform, or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(U(p, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(U(p, T)\\\\) may result from different sequences or forms of interventions due to the properties of integral transformations and how they modify the function space. Specifically, the transformations could have overlapping effects in transformed spaces, rendering it difficult to backtrack the exact sequence of events or transformations uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
