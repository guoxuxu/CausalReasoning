  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( x(T) \\), can we accurately determine which transformations were used (whether \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both) just by knowing the state at \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( x(T) \\) could be reached via various paths involving different combinations or sequences of interventions \\( g(x) \\) and \\( h(x) \\). The non-trivial interaction between these transformations and the dynamics dictated by K makes it challenging to uniquely trace back the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of K determines the rate of change of x(t). The transformation g(x) = Q^(-1)x changes the representation of x but not its dynamics. Knowing x(T) allows us to determine the transformation applied, as different transformations will result in different x(t) trajectories."
