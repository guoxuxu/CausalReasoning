  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\(dz = Pz \\, dt\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. Investigate the implications of applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\) over time \\(t\\), with \\(Q\\) also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), it's uncertain whether the state at \\( t = T \\) has been modified by \\( e^{Qt} \\) or not. Given \\( Qt \\) might not be trivially reversible especially if \\( Q \\) does not seamlessly invert with \\( P \\), retrieving \\( z_0 \\) accurately is not assured.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time is influenced by P. Applying the transformation g(z) = e^(Qt)z changes z over time. The initial state z(0) determines z(t) through the differential equation. Time t advances z from z(0) to z(t). Without knowing the application of g(z), inferring z(0) from z(t) at t=T depends on the specific values of P, Q, and T."
