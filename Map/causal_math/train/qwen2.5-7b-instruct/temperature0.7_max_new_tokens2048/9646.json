  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nCan the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 be precisely determined from the observed \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) affects the initial state in a way that cannot be simply inverted without knowing the transformation details. The complex rotation could have modified the initial state's nature, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\( x_0 \\) without this information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x_0 → x(t); M → x(t); ω → f(x); f(x) → x(t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector x_0 directly influences x(t) through the dynamics defined by M; the constant ω influences the transformation f(x) which then affects x(t); hence, knowing x(t) at time T can help infer x_0 if the transformation f(x) is known or can be accounted for."
