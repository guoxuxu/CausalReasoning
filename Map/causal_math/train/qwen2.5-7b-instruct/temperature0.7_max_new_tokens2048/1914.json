  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is studied under different transformations. Here, C and D are matrices, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the outcome when transformations \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) are applied, where F and G are also constant matrices.\n\nIs it possible to infer the exact initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the result observed at t = T could originate from different initial conditions, particularly if F impacts the system in a non-trivial way that cannot be simply reversed from observing the end state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t is determined by the initial vector z(0), matrix C, and matrix D. The application of transformation h(z) can alter z(t), and similarly for g(z). Knowing z(T) does not directly reveal z(0) without information on which transformation (if any) was applied."
