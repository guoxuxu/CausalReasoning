  "Problem": "Consider that velocity \\\\( v \\\\) of a particle moving in a one-dimensional space is governed by the equation \\\\( v = \\\\omega x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of an integral transform \\\\( I(x) = \\\\int x e^{-\\\\lambda t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is also a constant, applied to the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of the particle.\n\nGiven the velocity \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( I(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( I(x) \\\\), the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) remains indeterminable because the integral transformation could have modified the initial position in an irreversible manner, especially as the transformation involves integration over time with an exponential decay.",
