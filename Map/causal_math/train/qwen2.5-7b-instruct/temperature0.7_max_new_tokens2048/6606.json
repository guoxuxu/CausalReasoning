  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The effect of the Laplace transform on this function is studied, denoting the transform as \\\\( L\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can one uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), one can directly solve for \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by rearranging the equation. The unique determination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is possible as it is explicitly represented in the expression for \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
