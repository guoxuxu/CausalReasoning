  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), generating a new function in the s-domain.\n\nAssuming an intervention using a Hilbert transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) in the s-domain, will the final state of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be entirely independent of the original matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "While the Hilbert transform might manipulate the phase of the signal in the s-domain, the underlying dynamics dictated by A and B still influence the evolution of the real and imaginary components of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). Thus, the characteristics of matrices A and B continue to contribute to the final state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
