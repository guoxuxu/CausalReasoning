  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process described by the integral transformation \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^s K(s, t) Y(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( Y(t) \\\\) is a Brownian motion process and \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) is a deterministic kernel function. We assess the impact of modifying the kernel function \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) through the transformation \\\\( K_{new}(s, t) = e^{At}K(s, t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan the form of the original kernel \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) be exactly determined by observing the transformed process \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\) without knowing the specific transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( e^{At}K(s, t) \\\\) changes depending on the value of \\\\( A \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) from \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\) without specific knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\). The transformation could have various forms that yield similar results in the modified process.",
