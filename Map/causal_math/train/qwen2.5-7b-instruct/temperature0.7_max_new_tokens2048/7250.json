  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and C is a real constant. The function undergoes an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after transformation and evolution from 0 to T, can we deduce the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) integrates past behaviors of the system that have been modified, which obscures the original conditions. Without knowing the application of \\\\( T[z] \\\\), the reverse calculation to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot uniquely determine whether the transformation was applied.",
