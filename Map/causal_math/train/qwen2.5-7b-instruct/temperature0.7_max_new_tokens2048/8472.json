  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) \\) evolving over time according to \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\) applied at different time points.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely the transformations that were used (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) just by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the final state \\( z(T) \\) is difficult given that multiple combinations of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\), with varying application times, can lead to the same endpoint due to their phase-manipulating nature. These transformations can overlap in effects and alters the trajectory in ways that are non-distinguishable at the endpoint.",
