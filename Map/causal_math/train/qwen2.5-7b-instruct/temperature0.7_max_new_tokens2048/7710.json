  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing system where a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) modulates an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) according to the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\). \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then analyzed at various time points t using a Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the observed Fourier spectrum \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t = T \\\\), is it possible to exactly infer the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the impulse response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), reconstructing the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from its transformed output \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) is ambiguous. The convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) fundamentally alters the signal in a way that can't be uniquely reversed without additional information about \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original signal x(t) influences the modulated signal y(t), which in turn influences the Fourier spectrum Y(ω). The modulation function h(t) also directly influences y(t)."
