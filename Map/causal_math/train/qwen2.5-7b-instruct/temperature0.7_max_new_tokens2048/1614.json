  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a spatially varying coefficient. The impact of the initial transformation by Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[u(x,0)](s) \\\\) is studied over time t.\n\nCan we determine the original function u(x,0) after observing u(x,t) at any time t, without knowing the results from the Laplace transform or any other initial transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and first-order nature of the partial differential equation and assuming a(x) is known and properly handled, it’s typically possible to trace back to the original state u(x,0) uniquely by solving the equation backwards in time from any subsequent state u(x,t).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) directly influences u(x,t) over time. The coefficient a(x) directly causes variations in both ∂u/∂x and ∂u/∂t."
