  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\) with a given constant k. The influence of an external transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constants, is considered over time t.\n\nGiven the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at a later time T, is it possible to determine the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), it is unclear if the observed position at time T resulted from a natural evolution under \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\) or was influenced by the external transformation. This uncertainty in initial conditions makes it impossible to unequivocally trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
