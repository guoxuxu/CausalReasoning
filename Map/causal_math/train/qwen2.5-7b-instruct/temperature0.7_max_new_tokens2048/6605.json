  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The effect of the Laplace transform on this function is studied, denoting the transform as \\\\( L\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without further actions, will the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be different for a different frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) compared to the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\). Changing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) results in a different function \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\). These functions are not equivalent unless \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega' \\\\), indicating a dependency on the frequency.",
