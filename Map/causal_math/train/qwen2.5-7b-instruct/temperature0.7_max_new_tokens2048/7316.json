  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagating in a medium characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the wave function, \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(x\\\\) is spatial coordinate, and \\\\(c\\\\) is wave speed. Let's investigate the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at an initial time, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nAfter observing the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both) by examining only the observed wave state at T?",
  "Explanation": "Given only the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), it is not possible to definitively ascertain the individual or combined application of transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\). The overlap in possible effects from different transformations, especially when they involve frequency and amplitude changes, obscures the ability to isolate the exact interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying either g(u) or h(u) transformation results in changes to u(x, T), but determining which specific transformation(s) was/were applied solely based on u(x, T) at T is not possible without additional information."
