  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, and the effect of a Fourier transform on functions within this space. Specifically, examine the case where \\\\( Lf = -if' \\\\), and the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( f \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nIf known that the function was subjected to the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and then to an adding of a constant \\\\( c \\\\) before Fourier transforming, can we determine the exact original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{Lf}(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\) affects the Fourier transform only at \\\\( k = 0 \\\\). Because the action by L (differentiation) removes any constant component in \\\\( f \\\\), the original function \\\\( f \\\\) can't be uniquely determined if only the transformed derivative is known. At \\\\( k = 0 \\\\), critical information about \\\\( f \\\\)'s baseline level is lost.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear operator L transforms the function f into Lf, adding a constant c to f produces a new function g, and applying the Fourier transform to g yields its frequency domain representation \\hat{g}(k). The Fourier transform of Lf is \\hat{Lf}(k), and this relation helps in understanding the transformation but does not directly allow determining the exact original function f from \\hat{Lf}(k) without additional information."
