  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the influence of the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf at any time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(-t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the specific instance of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(-t) \\\\) modifies the temporal argument, affecting the Fourier transform by potentially altering the frequency components. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) depends on the intervention applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation z(t) → z(-t) at time t1 directly influences the endpoint hat{z}(ω, T) for T > t1, which in turn depends on both omega and the transformed z(t)."
