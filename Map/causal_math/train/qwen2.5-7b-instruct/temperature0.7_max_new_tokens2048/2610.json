  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where demand (d) and supply (s) functions for a market are governed by the parameters of a time-dependent differential equation system \\\\(\\\\dot{d} = Ad(t)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{s} = As(t)\\\\) respectively, with A being a negative constant that controls decay rate. The market is subjected to periodic economic swings described by a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) impacting both supply and demand, where B is a positive constant matrix showing growth over time.\n\nKnowing the status of demand and supply at time T, can we accurately trace back to determine the original values of \\\\( d_0 \\\\) and \\\\( s_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without information about whether \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), it is not feasible to accurately deduce the initial conditions \\\\( d_0 \\\\) and \\\\( s_0 \\\\) because the exponential function \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could alter their trajectories in a non-reversible manner, especially since B introduces a growing factor not accounted for in the standard decay model simulations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Demand and supply at time T are influenced by their initial values, the decay rate controlled by A, and the growth factor controlled by B. The initial values of demand and supply at t=0 affect their values at time T through the differential equations, while the periodic economic swings described by f(t) modify both demand and supply over time."
