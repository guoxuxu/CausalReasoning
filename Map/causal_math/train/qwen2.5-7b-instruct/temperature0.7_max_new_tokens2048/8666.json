  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where the initial condition is \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). We explore transformations using the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we definitively deduce the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could have undergone changes due to the transformation operation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), especially because the integral transformation might alter the phase and amplitude in a way that doesn't plainly divulge itself in the observed outputs at time T.",
