  "Problem": "We are examining the behavior of a complex valued function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where z is a complex number and A is a complex matrix. Consider the effects of applying Laplace transform on this function.\n\nIf a derivative operation applied to \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) before transforming, does the result solely depend on A?",
  "Explanation": "The derivative, which adjusts the input function before the transform, modifies the function in a way that remains tied to the properties of A. Even with intervention, the outcome of the transformation is still dictated by the characteristics of A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
