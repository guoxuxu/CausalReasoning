  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the effects of applying the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) where C is a constant.\n\nIf an additional integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Dt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where D is a constant) is applied at a time \\\\( T_1 > T \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( z(T_2) \\\\) for \\\\( T_2 > T_1 \\\\) only depend on the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the second transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T_1 \\\\) applies another layer of modification to the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Both C and D govern the nature of the transformations applied, affecting the total modification of \\\\( z \\\\) and consequently the endpoint condition at \\\\( T_2 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The values of x(t) and y(t) at any time t depend on their initial conditions and the constants A and B respectively. The integral transformations f(z) and g(z) do not affect the future values of z(t) for t > T1 if T1 > T, as they are based on historical values up to time T."
