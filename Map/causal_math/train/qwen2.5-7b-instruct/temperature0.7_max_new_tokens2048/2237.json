  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolving from t = 0 to t = T under the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) match that evolved only under its original evolution without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation modifies the integral path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with the exponential \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) influencing the rate and manner of accumulation over time. This results in a transformed state at time T that differs from simple exponential evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
