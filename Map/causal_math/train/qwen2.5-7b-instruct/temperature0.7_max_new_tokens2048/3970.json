  "Problem": "Assume a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform operation, \\\\(F[\\\\cdot]\\\\), applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\(F[z(T)]\\\\) of the function at time T, can one accurately determine the initial function \\\\(z(0)\\\\) without knowing if any transforms were applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform preserves all frequency information, including amplitudes and phases. Given \\\\(F[z(T)]\\\\) and knowing it evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), one can reverse the phase shifts applied over the interval from 0 to T to perfectly reconstruct \\\\(z(0)\\\\), assuming there was no loss of information through any potential transforms initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The derivative of z with respect to time (z'(t)) is caused by the value of omega; the initial function z(0) influences z(t); the Fourier transform of z at time T (F[z(T)]) is influenced by the Fourier transform of z at time 0 (F[z(0)]); z'(t) leads to the change in z(t)."
