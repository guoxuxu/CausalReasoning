  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the input function. We explore the effects of applying a differentiation operator, defined by \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) = t^\\\\alpha \\\\frac{d^\\\\alpha}{dt^\\\\alpha} f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a fractional differentiation order.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) after observing its transformed form \\\\( F(s) \\\\) post-application of \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) \\\\) without knowing the order \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) of differentiation?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from the differentiated function, without the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), makes it impossible to reverse-engineer back to \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The fractional order alters the function in a non-trivial, irreversible way without additional information on the order of differentiation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformed function F(s) is influenced by the original function f(t) through the integral transformation, and the application of the differentiation operator D_alpha(f)(t) modifies f(t) before it is transformed into F(s)."
