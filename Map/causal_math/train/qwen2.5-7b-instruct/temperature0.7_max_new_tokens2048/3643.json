  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that represents the temperature distribution over a rod, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We analyze the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification \\\\( h(u) = u + \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the heat equation's constant k and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the system's state again, making the final temperature distribution dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and k. The superposition of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) along with the heat diffusion governed by k results in complex interactions affecting the final state at any time T > t_1.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(u) and h(u) directly affect u, while k governs the rate of change of u with respect to x in the heat equation. Applying h(u) as an intervention after g(u) does not introduce dependence on omega or beta in the temperature distribution u(x, T) for T > t_1."
