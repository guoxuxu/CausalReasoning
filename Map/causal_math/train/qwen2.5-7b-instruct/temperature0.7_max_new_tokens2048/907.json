  "Problem": "Consider the linear system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We investigate the behavior of the system under the influence of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) denotes the Fourier transform and \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nIf a modulation represented by a multiplicative factor \\\\(e^{\\\\gamma k}\\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1 \\\\), will the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the original operator \\\\(L\\\\) without being influenced by the new factor?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation intervenes in the evolution process, altering the system's dynamics in Fourier space. Hence, the final Fourier solution \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) does not only depend on \\\\(L\\\\) but also significantly on the applied factor \\\\(e^{\\\\gamma k}\\\\), affecting the amplitude and potentially behavior, modifying the solution's dependency on initial and boundary conditions.",
