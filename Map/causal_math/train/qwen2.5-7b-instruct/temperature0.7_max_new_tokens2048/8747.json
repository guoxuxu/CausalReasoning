  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We are exploring the impact of performing a Fourier transform on this function over time and analyzing the behavior with subsequent Laplace transforms.\n\nIf a Laplace transform is applied in addition to the Fourier transform on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), during its evolution, will the final Laplace-domain representation be independent of the initial frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a Laplace transform, which considers both exponential decay and oscillatory behavior, makes the outcome sensitive to the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Thus, the parameters of the Laplace transform will reflect the value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\), revealing that different frequencies result in different poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial frequency ω determines the form of z(t), which then undergoes Fourier transformation, and the resulting Fourier domain function is transformed by the Laplace transform. The final Laplace-domain representation depends on ω."
