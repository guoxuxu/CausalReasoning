  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We explore different causal influences on the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its inverse transformations under varying conditions.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\), can we conclusively determine whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was originally \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) or immediately started as \\\\( e^{(a+b)t} \\\\) from t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The form \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\) does not allow us to infer whether the term \\\\( b \\\\) was part of the original function or was introduced as a later modification through an intervention. The transformation to the Laplace domain masks this distinction, making it impossible to identify the initial form or the exact nature of interventions in the causal pathway.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of f(z) depends on s and (a+b). Knowing f(z) = 1/(s-(a+b)) does not uniquely determine whether z(t) was originally e^(at) or e^((a+b)t) starting from t=0."
