  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral around a simple closed path C in the complex plane. We explore the integral transformation defined by the power series expansion \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n z^n \\\\), where \\\\( a_n \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at certain points along C, values of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) are modified by an intervention \\\\( h(z) = z^k \\\\) where k is an integer, will the transformed integral \\\\( \\\\oint_C h(g(z)) \\\\, dz \\\\) still reflect only the properties of the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional powers of z, potentially altering the nature and number of singularities within the curve C or its residues, thereby influencing the outcome of the integral. The resulting integral is affected by both the original form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the modified function \\\\( h(g(z)) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
