  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapped to a vector field by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is studied on the plane transformed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be deduced after observing \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the transformed complex plane affects the action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), altering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into multiple possible states before \\\\( g(z) \\\\) acts on it. Given \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\), multiple possible \\\\( z_0 \\\\) forms could exist due to the non-linearity and complexity of the transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
