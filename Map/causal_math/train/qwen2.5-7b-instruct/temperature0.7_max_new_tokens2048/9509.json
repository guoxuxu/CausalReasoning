  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the system under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix performing a linear transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) changes the initial state vector from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). The system's trajectory changes due to this altered initial condition, hence \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T after transformation will differ from the trajectory beginning with the true initial condition unless M commutes perfectly with the exponential of D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation M to x_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) results in x(t) at time t=T, which is equivalent to directly evolving x_0 to time t=T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)."
