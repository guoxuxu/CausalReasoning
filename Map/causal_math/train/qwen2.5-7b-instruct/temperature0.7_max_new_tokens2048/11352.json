  "Problem": "Let's analyze the behavior of a particle moving in a complex potential field described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = p(t) + iq(t)\\\\) where \\\\(p(t)\\\\) and \\\\(q(t)\\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates in a plane and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z + F(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\(F(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent force function.\n\nCan we precisely identify the occurrence and nature of the damping intervention \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) by analyzing the trajectory of the particle \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), assuming such an intervention might have occurred at an unknown time?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone, without knowledge of the entire trajectory or more specific details about the timing and nature of the intervention, does not allow for exact identification of when or even if the damping occurred, due to potential overlaps with effects from \\\\(F(t)\\\\) and the original complex dynamics induced by \\\\(-i\\\\omega z\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The force function F(t) and the angular frequency ω directly influence the particle's position z(t). The damping factor e^(-αt) influences z(t) through the term e^(-αt)z. The time T determines the state of z(t) at that specific moment."
