  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) describing the evolution of a function u(x,t) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes u(x,0) to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0)\\\\) and its impact on the solution space.\n\nGiven the final state u(x,T), can we specify which transformations were applied (either \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) or both) merely from the knowledge of u(x,T)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the different impacts on the solution by each transformation and possible similar effects resulting from different combinations of operations, it is not feasible to discern precisely which transformations were applied only based on the final state u(x,T). The transformations in different domains could yield overlapping or indistinguishable effects at the final state, complicating attribution to specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) influences the solution u(x,T) through the action of the linear differential operator L, and also transforms into the Fourier domain representation \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\) via the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), which in turn affects u(x,T) indirectly."
