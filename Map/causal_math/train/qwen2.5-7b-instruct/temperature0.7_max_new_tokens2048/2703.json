  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature \\\\( T(x, t) \\\\) at a point \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency constant.\n\nIf an intervention applying a new function \\\\( g(T) = T + \\\\cos(\\\\beta t) \\\\) is introduced at a random time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can the final state \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be correlated directly to only \\\\( k \\\\) disregarding \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention changes the temperature profile mid-process, adding another frequency-dependent term. The final state \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) then not only reflects the diffusivity constant \\\\( k \\\\) but also shows effects from both frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), making it dependent on the initial and intervention transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
