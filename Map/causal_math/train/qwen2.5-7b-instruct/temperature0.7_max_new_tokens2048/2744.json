  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex growth rate. We are examining the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda s} z(s) ds \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that some interventions (\\\\( T(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( H(z) \\\\)) might have been applied, can we precisely identify the initial conditions and ascertain which interventions were performed?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple potential scenarios could lead to the same observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) because of the non-linear and overlapping influences of the transformations and the underlying dynamics governed by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\). This ambiguity complicates the determination of the specific initial conditions and interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency iω and the complex growth rate λ directly cause the rate of change of z(t). The function z(t) at time t influences the integral transformation T(z). The integral transformation T(z) influences the value of z(T). An intervention H(z) may also influence the system."
