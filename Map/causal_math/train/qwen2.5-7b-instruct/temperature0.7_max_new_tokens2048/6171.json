  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. We will examine the effects of performing a Laplace transformation on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system by applying a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\) at some \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) during the evolution, does this affect the final Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s in a way independent of the initial phase shift \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state of the solution at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and impacts all future states, resulting in a compound effect with the initial phase shift on the total outcome. Both the initial condition modified by \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\) influentially shape \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), making the outcome dependent on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The partial differential equation ∂z/∂t = iAz governs the behavior of z(t), which transforms into Z(s) via the Laplace transform. Applying the function f(z) = e^(iφ)z at t = t1 modifies z(t), influencing Z(s). The initial phase shift e^(iθ)z_0 affects the initial condition of z(t) before any interventions."
