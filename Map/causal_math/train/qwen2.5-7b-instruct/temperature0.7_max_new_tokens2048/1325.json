  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) (squaring) is applied first and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) (exponential function) to a complex number z, will the outcome \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) at point z equal to directly applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on z without squaring?",
  "Explanation": "The squaring function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the input for the exponential function significantly. The function \\\\( e^{iz^2} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) represent vastly different transformations; squaring affects the rate and nature of oscillations in the complex exponential.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Squaring a complex number z and then applying the exponential function f results in the same outcome as directly applying the exponential function to z, due to the properties of complex exponentials and the definition of f(z) = e^(iz)."
