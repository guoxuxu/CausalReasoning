  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\), identifying how this transformed state evolves over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(u_0\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(u_0\\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\(t = T\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the initial state by converting it into its frequency components, thus changing the way the differential operator \\\\(L\\\\) acts on \\\\(u\\\\). As a result, the trajectory of the system and the state at time \\\\(T\\\\) will differ from the untransformed initial condition's evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial state u_0 and then evolving it under the PDE results in the same state u(t) as directly evolving u_0 under the PDE."
