  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear operator transformation on a Fourier series representation of a function. Let \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} a_n e^{inx} \\\\), and the transformation is defined by \\\\( T(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\), where \\\\( b_n \\\\) are coefficients modifying the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier-transformed function at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without knowing the coefficients \\\\( b_n \\\\) used in the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the transformation coefficients \\\\( b_n \\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( a_n \\\\) from the modified coefficients \\( b_n a_n \\). Multiple different initial functions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) could result in the same observed output under different sets of \\\\( b_n \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(g(x)) directly results from applying the coefficients b_n to the Fourier coefficients a_n, which in turn defines the transformed function T(g(x)). Knowing b_n allows us to determine T(g(x)), but without b_n, we cannot deduce the original function g(x) from T(g(x))."
