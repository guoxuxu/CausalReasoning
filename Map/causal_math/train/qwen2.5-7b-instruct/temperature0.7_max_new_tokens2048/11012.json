  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We study the effect of this transformation on the integral paths in the complex plane, specifically focusing on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) represents a path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( \\\\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\\\) where \\\\( g(z) = bz + c \\\\) was applied, can we determine the original path \\\\( C \\\\) and the nature of the transformation function \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral after the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) does not reliably encode information to revert to the original path uniquely. Multiple original paths and transformations might lead to the same resultant integral under different conditions, leading to ambiguity in deducing both the path and the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation function g(z) changes the integrand from e^(az) to e^(a(g(z))), which affects the integral path from C to C'. The constant a influences the form of the integrand e^(az), and the original path C is transformed to C' through the application of g(z)."
