  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system where the evolution of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix. We are interested in how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) over time, where D is another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T, can we unambiguously determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without being aware of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the transformation could have altered the initial conditions in a way that is not reversible based solely on the observation at T, especially if the matrices C and D do not commute, rendering the retrieval of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex constant matrix C influences the rate of change of z with respect to time. The matrix D defines the transformation g(z) which affects z over time. The initial state z(0) determines z(t) at any given time T. Without knowledge of g(z), it is not possible to unambiguously determine z(0) from z(T)."
