  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of the system. The effect of the integral transformation described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed with respect to its impact on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nUsing the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and allowing the system to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further action, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the path of evolution by integrating the state over time influenced by \\\\( B \\\\), thus altering subsequent evolutions from simply \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\) due to the integral component, leading to a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z_0 → z(t); A → z(t); t → z(t); B → g(z); τ → g(z); 0 → g(z); t → g(z); z(τ) → g(z); T → z(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 directly influences z(t) through the evolution matrix e^(At). The parameter A directly causes changes in z(t) over time t. The integral transformation B and its parameter τ, along with the bounds 0 and t, directly influence g(z). The time T directly determines the value of z(T)."
