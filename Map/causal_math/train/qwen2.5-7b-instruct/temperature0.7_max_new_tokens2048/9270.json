  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 u = f(x, y)\\\\) on a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) with boundary conditions applied. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to analyze the effects and causal relationships of applying different boundary interventions.\n\nGiven a function \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) as a solution at time T, can we unambiguously determine whether the change was due to a modification in the source term \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) from \\\\(f_1(x, y)\\\\) to \\\\(f_2(x, y)\\\\) or due to unchanged \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) over time without any boundary intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Detecting a specific change in source terms just by observing the end solution at time T is generally not possible without additional information about initial conditions and boundary settings. Multiple configurations of \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) or boundary conditions could yield the same end solution, reflecting the inability to back-infer uniquely from effect to cause without a specific intervention record.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The source term f(x, y) directly influences the solution u(x, y, T), and changes in f(x, y) from f_1(x, y) to f_2(x, y) will result in changes in u(x, y, T)."
