  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original system \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions of the system by scaling and potentially rotating the state depending on the structure of A. This modified initial condition evolves differently under the system's dynamics, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T(z) to z_0 at t=0 and then evolving it under the original system results in the same final state z(T) as directly evolving z_0 to time T under the original system."
