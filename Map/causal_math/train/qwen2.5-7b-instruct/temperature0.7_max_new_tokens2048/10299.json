  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to transform the contour of integration in the complex plane for an integral \\\\(I = \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), where \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is a holomorphic function and \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple closed contour.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) is introduced as an intentional change at some point during the integration over \\\\( w(C) \\\\), will the resultant integral value depend solely on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and not on \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral value will be influenced by both transformations \\\\( w(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The sequence and nature of such transformations will affect the path and potentially introduce new elements or exclude others affecting the overall integral.",
