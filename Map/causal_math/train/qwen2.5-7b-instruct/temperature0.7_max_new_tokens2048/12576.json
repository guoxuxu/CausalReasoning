  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The influence of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, is analyzed over time. This transformation modifies the trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to the function at t = 0, resulting in a new initial state \\\\( z(0) = b \\\\), and then allowed to evolve with the original complex function without further transformation, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no initial transformation occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L(z) \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition to \\\\( z(0) = b \\\\), thereby altering the entire trajectory. The term \\\\( b \\\\) adds a constant shift in the complex plane, which will affect all subsequent positions of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear transformation L(z) at t=0 changes the initial state z(0) to b, which then evolves according to the original function z(t) = e^(iωt) to z(T). Without the transformation, z(t) would directly evolve from its original initial condition to z(T). The trajectory at t=T will differ due to the change in initial state caused by L(z)."
