  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where vectors are transformed by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_a^b K(x, y) f(y) dy \\\\) operates on functions where \\\\( K(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function. We analyze the system's behavior when an initial function \\\\( f_0 \\\\) is either subjected directly to \\\\( T \\\\) or modified by a linear operation before application of \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nObserving the output of the system, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( f_0 \\\\) without knowing the specifics of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) or matrix \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the kernel \\\\( K(x, y) \\\\) in \\\\( T \\\\) and the elements of matrix \\\\( M \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( f_0 \\\\) from the output could be underdetermined. There may be multiple potential functions that could yield the same output under different configurations of \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function f_0 directly influences the output, and the transformation T also directly influences the output. The matrix M indirectly influences the output through its effect on T."
