  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the effects of differentiating this function and the application of an operation \\\\( T(z) = z' \\\\), where \\\\( z' \\\\) denotes the derivative of z.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) for some x, can we uniquely recover the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) and its dependence \\\\( z'(x) = e^{x^2} \\\\), one can recover \\\\( z(x) \\\\) by integrating \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) from 0 to x, which coincides with the original definition of \\\\( z(x) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( z(x) \\\\) can be uniquely recovered from its derivative given no external alterations to the derivative process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
