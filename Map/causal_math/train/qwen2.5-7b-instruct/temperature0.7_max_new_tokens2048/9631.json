  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real constant matrix and z a complex number. We study the behavior of this function when subject to transformations and analyze the inverse Laplace transformation which is given by \\\\( F(p) = L^{-1} \\\\{ f(z) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf an adjustment by a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCz} \\\\) (where C is a real constant matrix) is applied at a specific point and then the inverse Laplace transformation is applied, will the resulting function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) be different from the case with no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a point modifies the function from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to a new composite function involving both A and C, altering the original dynamics. The Laplace transformation of this new function, considering the effects of both exponentials, will inherently differ from that without \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the function g(z) modifies f(z), which in turn affects F(p) through the inverse Laplace transformation. Since g(z) introduces a different matrix C compared to the original A, F(p) will be different with the intervention."
