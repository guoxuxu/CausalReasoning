  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. This function is integrated over time using the transformation \\\\(F(z) = \\int_0^T f(t) z(t) dt\\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of this integral transformation when a parameter adjustment, represented by function \\\\(g(z) = ze^{i\\theta}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant, is either applied initially or during the process.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(h(z) = ze^{i\\phi}\\\\) (where \\\\(\\phi\\\\) is a constant phase) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(F(z)\\\\) for T > t_1 be determined solely by \\\\(\\omega\\\\) and not by \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) or \\\\(\\phi\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) affects the remaining part of the function from \\\\(t_1\\\\) to T. This change impacts the computation of \\\\(F(z)\\\\), making the final value dependent on both \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) (from any initial adjustment) and \\\\(\\phi\\\\). The resulting integral is influenced by the original parameter and the intervention, each contributing distinct phase shifts.",
