  "Problem": "Suppose there is a function \\\\(z(x, t)\\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + x \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) where x represents space and t represents time. An intervention \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is defined as \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x, t) + v(x, t)\\\\), with \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) being solutions to another set of PDEs.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function as \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x, t) - v(x, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), will the resultant state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) directly follow from the transformation applied at \\\\(t_1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "After the intervention, the new form of the function explicitly dictates its future evolution. Given the PDE's linear nature and lack of additional independent variables or non-linear terms, the subsequent state at any time \\\\(T\\\\) can be inferred directly from the state at the time of intervention \\\\(t_1\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(x, t) → z(x, t); u(x, t) → z(x, t); v(x, t) → z(x, t)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention h(x, t) changes z(x, t) from z(x, t) = u(x, t) + v(x, t) to z(x, t) = u(x, t) - v(x, t) at time t = t1, which affects z(x, t) for T > t1 through the dynamics defined by the PDE."
