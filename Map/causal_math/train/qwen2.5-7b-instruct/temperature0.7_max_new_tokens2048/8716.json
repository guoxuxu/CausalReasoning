  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the eigenvalues of the final transformed matrix after applying both \\\\( T(A) \\\\) and \\\\( S(A) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the transformations used (e.g., the specific matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the eigenvalues alone does not provide information about the specific matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) used in the transformations, because many different matrices can be used to achieve the same eigenvalue-preserving similarity transformation. The specific form of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined solely from the eigenvalues of the output matrix.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A determine its eigenvalues and eigenvectors after transformation by B^-1AB. The transformations T(A) and S(A) applied to A result in the same eigenvalues as B^-1AB but may differ in eigenvectors. Knowing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of B^-1AB does not uniquely determine the specific matrices B and C used in the transformations."
