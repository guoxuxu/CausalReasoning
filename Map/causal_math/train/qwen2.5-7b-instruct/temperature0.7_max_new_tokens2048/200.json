  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanics problem where a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). We examine the situation where an operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) acts on \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) before evolution.\n\nCan the specific initial operation (\\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\hat{P}\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\)) be deduced purely based on the observation of \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\) might not uniquely correspond to specific operations due to the complexities of quantum mechanics, where different combinations of operators and initial conditions can yield similar or even identical wave functions at time \\\\(T\\\\). Determining which operations were applied requires additional context or measurement data beyond the wave function at a single time point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "hat{O} → psi(x, 0); hat{P} → psi(x, t_1); V(x) → psi(x, t); psi(x, 0) → psi(x, t); psi(x, t_1) → psi(x, T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) applied at \\\\(t=0\\\\) influences the initial wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\), which then evolves under the potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\) to become \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\). Similarly, the operator \\\\(\\\\hat{P}\\\\) applied at \\\\(t_1\\\\) influences \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t_1)\\\\), leading to further evolution to \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\).
