  "Problem": "Let's consider a scenario involving a circuit with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and two components: a resistor with resistance R and a capacitor with capacitance C. The input voltage across the circuit can be described by the function \\\\( u(t) = U_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and we are interested in analyzing the output voltage across the capacitor \\\\( v(t) \\\\) using the Laplace transform.\n\nIf a filter designed to adjust the phase shift by \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) degrees is added at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final phase shift of the output voltage at time T (> t_1) be independent of the initial input frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final phase shift results from both the original phase shift induced by the circuit configuration (which depends on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)) and the additional shift introduced by the filter. The outcome is thus dependent on both the initial frequency and the characteristics of the filter.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input voltage u(t) and the component values R and C directly cause the output voltage v(t); the angular frequency ω, the filter phase shift φ, and the time T indirectly influence v(t) through their effects on the circuit behavior."
