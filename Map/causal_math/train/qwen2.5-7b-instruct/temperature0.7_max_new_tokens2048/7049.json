  "Problem": "Consider a linear function \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, used to transform complex vector input \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is determined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and this transformed vector is then evolved using \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}(Cz_0) \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) coincide with \\\\( e^{DT}(z_0) \\\\) had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) been evolved without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) modifies the initial state such that the evolution \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) acts on \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\) instead of just \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The properties and the eigenvalues of matrices C and D determine the new trajectory and generally, \\\\( e^{DT}z_0 \\\\) will not equal \\\\( e^{DT}(Cz_0) \\\\) unless C commutes with D and is a scalar matrix.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(0) evolves over time to become z(t). Applying the transformation C to z_0 results in Cz_0 which, when further evolved over time, becomes z(T) = e^(Dt)(Cz_0). Had z_0 been evolved without transformation, it would have become e^(Dt)z_0 at time T. Therefore, z(T) coincides with e^(DT)z_0 if and only if C is the identity matrix."
