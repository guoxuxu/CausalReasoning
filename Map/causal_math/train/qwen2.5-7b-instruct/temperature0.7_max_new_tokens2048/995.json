  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. We examine the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) to the system, where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) adds a new layer of transformation, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interaction of A, B, and the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). The compounded effect of these transformations influences the trajectory and final position.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
