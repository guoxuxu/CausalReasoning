  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) inserts a new phase shift, resulting in an endpoint depending on both the original phase shift parameter \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), the new shift \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and the system's inherent frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\theta + \\\\alpha)(T - t_1) + i(\\\\omega + \\\\theta)t_1} z_0 \\\\) reflects all these influences.",
