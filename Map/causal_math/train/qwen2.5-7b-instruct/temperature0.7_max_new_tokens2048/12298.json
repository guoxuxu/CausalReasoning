  "Problem": "Consider a response system described by \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty h(t) x(z-t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transform applied to the system's output, where the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf, at some point during the observation, an additional filter described by another impulse response \\\\( g(t) \\\\) (with its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) \\\\)), is introduced, will the Fourier transform of the output \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) after this intervention reflect only the properties of the original impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a filter \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies the system by changing the overall impulse response to the convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Thus, the output's Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) will reflect the combined effects of \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) \\\\), not just \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
