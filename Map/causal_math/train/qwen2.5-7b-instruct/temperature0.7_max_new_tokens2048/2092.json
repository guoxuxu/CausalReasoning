  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping from the complex plane to itself given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{az+b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate the effects of this transformation under the integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the specific values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used in the transformation after applying a corrective transformation during the integral, solely based on the result of the integral?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the application of a corrective transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the integral result only reflects the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and does not retain specific information about \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Information about the particular values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used is lost in the neutralization process.",
