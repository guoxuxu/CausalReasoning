  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model with complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex number. We explore the effects of the Laplace Transform on this function, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f(t)](s) \\\\), to transform from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying a filter described by another Laplace Transformable function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed function \\\\( h(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[f(t) \\\\cdot g(t)](s) \\\\), does the resulting function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) still purely depend on the original \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without influence from g?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) mixes the characteristics of both functions in the frequency domain through convolution or multiplication, thereby altering the resultant function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) significantly. This output depends on the nature of both \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) and their interaction, not just on \\\\( f \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) and g(t) both directly cause h(s) through their product being transformed by the Laplace Transform."
