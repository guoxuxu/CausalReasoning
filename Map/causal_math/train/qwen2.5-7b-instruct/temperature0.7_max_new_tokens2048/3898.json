  "Problem": "Consider the linear algebra system where vector transformation through matrices plays a key role. Let \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be the state of a system at any time t, evolving according to the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N(t)\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and \\\\(N(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent  force vector. Let there be an operation \\\\(h(z) = S t z\\\\), with S being a non-commutative constant matrix applied at a specified time.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time t, can we determine the initial vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the operation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), recovering the exact state \\\\(z_0\\\\) is not feasible. The modification by S and the presence of non-linearity due to N(t) introduce ambiguities that prevent backward calculation from \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(t) evolves over time due to the influence of Mz + N(t), and applying the operation h(z) results in S t z. Without knowledge of whether h(z) was applied, we cannot directly determine the initial vector z_0 from z(t) alone."
