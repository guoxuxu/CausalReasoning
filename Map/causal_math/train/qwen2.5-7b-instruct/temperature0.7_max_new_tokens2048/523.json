  "Problem": "Examine a feedback loop in an electrical circuit, modeled by a linear time-invariant system with transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sP + Q} \\\\), where P and Q are constant matrices. Let us consider an alteration involving the introduction of a feedback matrix K, changing the system to \\\\( \\\\tilde{H}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sP + Q + K} \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a second feedback matrix \\\\( L \\\\) is introduced, resulting in a system transformation to \\\\( \\\\hat{H}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sP + Q + K + L} \\\\), will the system's output at time \\\\( t = T \\\\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), only depend on the original parameters P and Q?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another feedback matrix \\\\( L \\\\) further transforms the system, impacting its dynamics by changing the overall transfer function yet again. The output at time T is now contingent on the cumulative effects of P, Q, K, and L, reflecting the complexities added by each feedback loop.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of matrix K changes the system from H(s) to \\\\( \\\\tilde{H}(s) \\\\), and further introducing matrix L changes it to \\\\( \\\\hat{H}(s) \\\\). Therefore, the system's output at time T depends on the matrices P, Q, K, and L."
