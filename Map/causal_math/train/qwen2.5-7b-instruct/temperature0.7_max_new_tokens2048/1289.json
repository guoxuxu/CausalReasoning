  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. This function is used in transformations of signals in a system described by the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} h(t)z(t) dt \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being the system's impulse response.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and allowed to propagate in a system without any further intervention, will the output at time \\\\( T \\\\) be purely determined by the initial form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the system is entirely determined by the convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the integral transformation, which embodies the cause (input signal and system response) leading directly to the effect (output signal), without any need for further intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
