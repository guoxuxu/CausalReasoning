  "Problem": "Consider a set of functions defined by complex mappings \\\\( z = f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) where w is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit. The system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(w(t)) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) = g + ht \\\\) where g and h are complex constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( f'(w) = e^{-iw} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, be solely dependent on the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the transformation \\\\( f'(w) = e^{-iw} \\\\) fundamentally alters the evolution path by applying the inverse exponential function, effectively undoing or altering the previous exponential mapping's effects. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus depends on both transformations applied throughout the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T depends on the transformation applied to w over time, starting from w(t) and potentially switching to f'(w) at t1. Initially, z(t) = e^(iw(t)), but after t1, z(t) = e^(-iw(t)) if f'(w) is applied."
