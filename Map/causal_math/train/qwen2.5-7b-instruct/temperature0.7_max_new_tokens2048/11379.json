  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform on this function.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( w(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) (also transformable) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( W(s) \\\\) only depend on the transforms of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and not on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in a new function whose Laplace transform, \\\\( W(s) \\\\), will be the sum of the individual transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( W(s) \\\\) will depend on both the components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform W(s) of the function w(t) depends on its components u(t) and v(t), while the Laplace transform of z(t) depends on x(t) and y(t). Therefore, W(s) does not directly depend on the transforms of x(t) and y(t), but rather on u(t) and v(t)."
