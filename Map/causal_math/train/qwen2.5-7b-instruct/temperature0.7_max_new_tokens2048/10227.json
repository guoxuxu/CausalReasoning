  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by the heat equation in a rod, described by \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the position along the rod. Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) to the equation and the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) after a specific time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + v \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a disturbance function, is applied as an intervention, will the resulting temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the behavior according to \\\\( ku_{xx} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with function \\\\( g(u) \\\\) introduces an additional term, modifying the temperature distribution in ways not dictated solely by the heat equation. This results in a deviation from the expected distribution based solely on the unmodified heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of temperature over time (u_t) directly causes the second derivative of temperature with respect to position (u_xx); the temperature (u) influences the transformed function (g(u)); the transformed function (g(u)) directly causes the temperature distribution at time T (u(T)); the passage of time (t) directly causes the temperature distribution at time T (u(T))."
