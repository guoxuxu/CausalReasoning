  "Problem": "We consider a set of dependent integral transformations on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by the equations \\\\( v(x) = \\\\int_0^x u(s) e^{-s} ds \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( w(x) = \\\\int_x^\\\\infty v(t) dt \\\\). The transformation from \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( w(x) \\\\) involves a mixing of the cause and effect through double integration, one being definite from 0 to x and the other from x to infinity.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(x) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( e^x \\\\) at some point T, will this change the subsequent values of \\\\( w(x) \\\\) beyond T?",
  "Explanation": "Any modification to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) after T specifically alters \\\\( v(t) \\\\) for t >= T, and since \\\\( w(x) \\\\) is an integral from x to infinity of \\\\( v(t) \\\\), changes in \\\\( u(x) \\\\) within and beyond T will affect the output values of \\\\( w(x) \\\\) beyond T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Intervening on u(x) directly causes changes in v(x) and w(x). Since v(x) is an intermediate variable between u(x) and w(x), changing u(x) by a factor of e^x at point T will affect w(x) for all x > T."
