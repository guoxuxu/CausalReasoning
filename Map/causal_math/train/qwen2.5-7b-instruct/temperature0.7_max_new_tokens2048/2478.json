  "Problem": "In a control theory context, consider the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\\\) where C and D are constant matrices, and u is a control input. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform on the system's response, particularly through an impulse response represented by matrix H, where H is defined as the transformation \\\\(H(s) = C^{-1}D\\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the system's output Y(s), can one unambiguously determine the original control input u(t) without additional information about initial conditions or system parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The determination of control input u(t) from Y(s) requires knowledge of the system parameters, specifically H(s) and initial conditions, as different inputs could yield the same output under varying system dynamics or initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u directly influences the state x, which then determines the impulse response H through matrix C and D. The impulse response H, when transformed via the Laplace transform, leads to the output Y(s). Without additional information about initial conditions or system parameters, it is not possible to unambiguously determine the original control input u(t) from Y(s) alone."
