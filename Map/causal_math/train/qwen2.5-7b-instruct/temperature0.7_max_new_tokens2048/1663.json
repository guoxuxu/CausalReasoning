  "Problem": "In a controlled environment, the complex function \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) is implemented in a system, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a time-parameterized linear function given by \\\\( w = at + bi \\\\), with constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The system's output \\\\( z \\\\) is analyzed before and after the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a fixed time.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within \\\\( 0 \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), an external intervention modifies \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w' = ct + di \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are constants), will the transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) now depend solely on the new parameters \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards?",
  "Explanation": "Although the intervention adjusts the parameters influencing \\\\( z \\\\), the transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) encompasses the behavior of the system from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\), including the interval before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influenced by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Hence, the output depends on both sets of parameters, not solely on \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\).",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of \\( w \\) influences the output \\( z \\); modifying \\( w \\) to \\( w' \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) changes the output \\( z \\) starting from that time; the transformation \\( T[z(t)] \\) depends on the parameters \\( s \\) and the values of \\( w \\) over the interval from 0 to \\( T \\); hence, from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, \\( T[z(t)] \\) will reflect the influence of both the original and modified parameters."
