  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), which maps a function in the time domain to a function in the complex frequency domain. Investigate the effect of modifying this transformation by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), where a is a real number.\n\nIf \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) is multiplied to the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at the outset, then the system's behavior is allowed to evolve without further transformation. Does this modification keep the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) unchanged throughout its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) effectively shifts the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in time domain by a, which means the inverse transform results in a translated version of the original function, \\\\( f(t-a) \\\\). It does not retain the same state as the unmodified \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying the Laplace transform by \\( e^{-as} \\) results in a modified transform, which when inverse-transformed, yields a time-domain function that reflects the original function shifted in time."
