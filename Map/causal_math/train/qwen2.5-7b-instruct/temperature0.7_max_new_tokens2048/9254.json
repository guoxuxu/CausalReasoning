  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of a transformation via the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t,x)\\\\} = U(s,x) \\\\) over variable t.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) by observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) at some later time T without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "If the system evolves purely under the heat equation without further transformation or intervention, the initial condition \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) can be inferred from \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) by utilizing techniques such as backward solving of the heat equation or employing inverse transformations, assuming no other sources or sinks.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
