  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its integration along a path in the complex plane. Analyze the influence of deforming the integration path from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = 1 + i \\\\) using two different paths, a straight line (path A) and a semicircle in the upper half-plane centered at \\\\( z = 0.5 + 0.5i \\\\) with radius 0.5 (path B).\n\nDoes the choice of path (A vs. B) affect the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_{path} f(z) dz \\\\) from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = 1 + i \\\\) when no intervention is made on the function or path mid-way?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-convex nature of the function \\\\( e^z \\\\) in the complex plane, the integral is dependent on the path chosen. Different paths can enclose different numbers of singularities or none at all, significantly affecting the integral's value even though the endpoints are the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
