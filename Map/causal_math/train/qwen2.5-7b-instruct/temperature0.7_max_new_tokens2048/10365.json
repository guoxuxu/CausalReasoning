  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under a linear transformation described by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) applied on the vector representation \\\\( (x, y) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(u) du \\) is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf the initial complex function \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve under its transformation for a time period T without further intervention, will \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\) be independent of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) affects its trajectory, thus altering the outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\. Since \\\\( T[z] \\\\) includes an integration dependent on the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T (influenced by \\\\( A \\\\)), it is not independent of \\\\( A \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex function z(0) evolves over time to become z(T), which is influenced by the matrix A. The transformation T then acts on z(T) to produce T[z(T)], making T[z(T)] dependent on A."
