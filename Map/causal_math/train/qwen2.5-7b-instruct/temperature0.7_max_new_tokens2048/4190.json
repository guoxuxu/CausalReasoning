  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta \\\\\\\\ \\beta & \\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) are constants, on the state vector representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from which \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolved be uniquely determined by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied, the deducing of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is ambiguous due to the potential alteration by \\\\( M \\\\). The application of \\\\( M \\\\) could modify \\\\( z(0) \\\\), shifting phases and/or scales, thereby blending with changes from \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), and causing multiple possibilities for \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
