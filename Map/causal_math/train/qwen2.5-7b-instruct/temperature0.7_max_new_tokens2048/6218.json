  "Problem": "Evaluate how the Laplace Transform impacts the causality between a pair of functions \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), where \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) and \\( u(t) \\) is its derivative using the relation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\} = sF(s) - f(0) \\), where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace Transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} \\) as \\( 2/s^2 \\), can it be inferred with certainty that \\( u(t) \\) was derived from the function \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) without direct knowledge of \\( v(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse process from \\( 2/s^2 \\) back to \\( u(t) = 2t \\) is definitive, but it cannot be uniquely concluded that \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) without other information, as other functions differentiated can also result in the same \\( u(t) \\).",
