  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) representing oscillatory behavior with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). We examine the scenario where we apply a Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thereby transforming the function into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an alteration is made post-Fourier transform, specifically an amplitude modulation in the frequency domain, will the inverse Fourier transform still yield the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Amplitude modulation or any other alteration in the frequency domain fundamentally changes the spectral characteristics of the signal. Consequently, the inverse Fourier transform will reflect these modifications, resulting in a distortion of the original time-domain signal \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
