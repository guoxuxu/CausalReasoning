  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nHaving observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine exactly what value or matrix A was used in transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) if we know the function did not deviate from \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though we know the functional form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), without additional information about the initial condition or the specific transformation applied at t = 0, we cannot uniquely determine the matrix \\\\(A\\\\). Multiple matrices could yield the same result depending on their interaction with the initial conditions and the specific time point T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
