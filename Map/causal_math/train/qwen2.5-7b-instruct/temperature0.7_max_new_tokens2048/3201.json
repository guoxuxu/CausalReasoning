  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider the modification of the initial temperature distribution by the function \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, does the evolved temperature distribution at time t reflect only the properties of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding a sinusoidal wave, which alters the subsequent evolution of the temperature field according to the heat equation. The term \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) introduces additional spatial variation, influencing the temperature distribution over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution u_0 directly influences the temperature distribution u through the heat equation, where the rate of change of u over time depends on the second spatial derivative of u scaled by thermal diffusivity κ. Applying the transformation g(u) = u + sin(ωx) modifies u but does not alter the fundamental relationship between u_0 and u as described by the heat equation."
