  "Problem": "Examine a system where electric potential V is described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) within a region and manipulate the boundary conditions to observe causal effects. We're especially interested in how transformations such as conformal mappings can infer changes in electric field distributions.\n\nCan one deduce the original domain shape and boundary condition of potential \\\\(V\\\\) from its distribution in a transformation-effected domain without knowing the specific mapping used?",
  "Explanation": "The final distribution of \\\\(V\\\\) does not uniquely encode the original domain or the specific conformal mapping, hence multiple mappings might result in the same transformed potential distribution. Without explicit information on the conformal map applied, multiple original configurations might be plausible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Electric potential V directly influences the electric field E and the Laplacian of V. A transformation affects the domain, which can be inferred from the transformed potential's distribution, leading to the deduction of the original domain shape and boundary conditions."
