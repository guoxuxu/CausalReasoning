  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to a complex number \\\\( z_0 = u_0 + iv_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\) without further intervention, where c is a real constant, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially rotates the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), altering its arguments by adding a phase shift of \\\\( i\\\\omega t \\\\). This change in the initial condition leads to a different trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it evolves, resulting in a state at time T that differs from the one it would have reached without the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) at t=0 changes z to z(t), which then evolves under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\) over time t to become z(T). The constant c and time T directly influence z(t) through this evolution."
