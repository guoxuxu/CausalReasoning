  "Problem": "Consider a function h(z) defined over the complex plane, and let's apply a Fourier transform on this function, denoted as H(w), to analyze its behavior in frequency space.\n\nIf h(z) is defined as z^n where n is a positive integer, and then the Fourier transform is applied to derive H(w), will the nature (e.g., continuity, differentiability) of H(w) solely depend on the value of n?",
  "Explanation": "The properties of H(w) directly depend on the value of n and the polynomial degree of z^n. The Fourier transform's characteristics such as continuity and differentiability are intrinsically linked to the exponent n, determining the rate of decay and smoothness at infinity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
