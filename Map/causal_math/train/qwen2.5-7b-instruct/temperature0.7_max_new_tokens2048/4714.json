  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function defines wave-like motion in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied to study its effect.\n\nBy examining the function at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine if any transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied during its evolution up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information regarding the application of the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not indicate whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied or not, as \\\\( T \\\\) is independent in its application from the standard evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves over time under the influence of matrix A, and this evolution is transformed by matrix B through the integral transformation T to produce Tz(t)."
