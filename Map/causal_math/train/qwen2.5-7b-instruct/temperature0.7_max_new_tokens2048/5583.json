  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real numbers and represent the real and imaginary components of the exponent, respectively. The transformation is studied in the context of its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+2iB)t} \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the system evolves to time T, will the peak of the Fourier Transform still occur at the same \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the imaginary component of the exponent from \\\\( iB \\\\) to \\\\( 2iB \\\\). This shifts the peak of the Fourier Transform from \\\\( \\\\omega = B \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega = 2B \\\\), indicating a different frequency component dominating the transformation post-intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of A and B directly influences the Fourier Transform F(ω); the intervention at time t_1 changes z(t) which subsequently affects F(ω); the evolution to time T further influences F(ω)."
