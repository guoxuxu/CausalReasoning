  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where both A and B are constant matrices. To study the behavior of the system, an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, with s being a complex parameter.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely the time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) at which the intervention changing A to A' occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation by nature masks the specific instants at which changes occur within the system, as it summarizes the entire evolution up to T. Therefore, we cannot precisely pinpoint the intervention time just by observing \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\), as it is obfuscated by the integral's accumulative nature.",
