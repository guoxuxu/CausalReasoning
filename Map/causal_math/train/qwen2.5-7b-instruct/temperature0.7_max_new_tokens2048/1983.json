  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\), where M is a matrix representing the linear operator in a complex plane. An operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), with N being another constant matrix, is applied to this system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention occurs applying another operator \\\\( U(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where Q is another constant matrix), will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be purely dependent on the original matrix M or influenced by N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) adds another variable influencing the final state at time T. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the combined effects of M, N, and Q. Both the temporal transformations introduced by \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) influence the trajectory, making the system’s endpoint a function of these matrices as well as the original M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "M → dz/dt; N → dz/dt; Q → dz/dt",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Both N and Q influence the rate of change of z through their respective exponentials, which in turn affects the end state z(T) at T > t_1. The original matrix M determines the linear operator but is also indirectly affected by N and Q through the system dynamics."
