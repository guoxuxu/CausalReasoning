  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving under a system driven by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Mu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Nv \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( T[w] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At} w(t) dt \\\\) with a constant matrix A is applied to study the dynamics.\n\nCan we retrospectively determine which matrices (M, N, or O) were applied based solely on the end value of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) after knowing an intervention occurred at \\\\( t = T/2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integrated nature and mutual influences in the dynamics of u and v under the action of M, N, and O, the final result of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) encompasses mixed effects. These effects are inextricably linked to their integral contributions making it impossible to disentangle the direct influence of each matrix just by observing the outcome at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
