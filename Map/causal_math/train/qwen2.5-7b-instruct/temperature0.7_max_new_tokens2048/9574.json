  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ku \\\\), with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{\\\\alpha t}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, is analyzed.\n\nCan the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined after acquiring the result of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without additional data about \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or the history of the function?",
  "Explanation": "The value \\\\( F(z) \\\\) depends on both the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) across the interval and the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and since multiple combinations of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) might yield the same result for \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
