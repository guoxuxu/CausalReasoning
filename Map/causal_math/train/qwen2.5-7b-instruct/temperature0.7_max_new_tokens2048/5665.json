  "Problem": "Consider a continuous dynamical system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The transformation is defined by \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is altered by multiplication with \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) at t = 0, and then the Laplace transform is applied without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( U(s) \\\\) be the same as that obtained from the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( u(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) before applying the Laplace transform shifts the original transform \\\\( U(s) \\\\) to \\\\( U(s-a) \\\\). This results in a transformation where the function is evaluated at different values of \\\\( s \\\\), changing the outcome of the Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Multiplying the initial function \\( u(t) \\) by \\( e^{at} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\\\) changes its Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\\\) to \\( \\frac{U(s-a)}{s-a} \\\\), which is different from the Laplace transform of the original function."
