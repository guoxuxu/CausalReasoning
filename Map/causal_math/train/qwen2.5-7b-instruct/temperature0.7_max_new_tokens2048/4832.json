  "Problem": "Consider the discrete-time system defined by the equation \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Bx\\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing only the matrix A and the final state \\\\(y(N)\\\\) at n = N, can we precisely determine the sequence and types of interventions applied (\\\\(g(y)\\\\) at n = 0 and \\\\(h(y)\\\\) at n = 1) directly from \\\\(y(N)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interplay between the transformations due to B and C and the repetitive application of A can yield similar end states that are not distinguishable solely based on \\\\(y(N)\\\\). Multiple intervention sequences could result in the same end state depending on how matrices B, C, and A interact. Hence, without explicit information about B and C, the exact sequence of interventions cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
