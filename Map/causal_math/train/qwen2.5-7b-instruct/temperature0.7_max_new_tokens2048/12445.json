  "Problem": "We consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real variable and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex number. The function is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) along with the application of a scaling and phase shift operation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{a+ib}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The additional phase and scaling alter the frequency and amplitude in a way that the original state cannot be determined without this information.",
