  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation system defined by \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x K(x,t) y(t) dt \\\\) where K is a kernel function involving complex operations. We evaluate the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(x,t) = K(x,t) \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we unequivocally trace back which modifications (original kernel, the exponential modification, or the sinusoidal addition) were present given the end solution \\\\( y(x) \\\\) on a certain interval?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific modifications based solely on the endpoint values of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) can be highly challenging due to the overlapping influences that each kernel modification can bring. Given the complexity and potential for similar outputs from different kernel modulations, definitive backtracking of interventions isn't typically feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
