  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) on an infinite rod, where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) represent the partial derivatives of temperature \\\\(u\\\\) with respect to time \\\\(t\\\\) and the second spatial derivative with respect to \\\\(x\\\\), respectively. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x, t) \\\\, dx\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function transformation \\\\(v(x, t) = u(x, t) + e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new term that affects the temperature distribution, altering the solution to the heat equation. Since this new addition is independent of the initial conditions and operates under different dynamics, the end result at any time T > t_1 will reflect the influence of both \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and the original heat equation.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation v(x, t) = u(x, t) + e^(αt) at time t_1 changes the temperature profile u(x, T) for T > t_1, introducing an additional exponential term that depends on time. The original heat equation u_t → u_xx does not account for this change."
