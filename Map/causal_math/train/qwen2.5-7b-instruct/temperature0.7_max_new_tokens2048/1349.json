  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\) is the wave function and H is the Hamiltonian operator. We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iK} \\\\psi \\\\), with K being a constant operator, is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the Schrödinger equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iK} \\\\psi \\\\) alters the phase of the wave function at initial time, potentially changing how it evolves dynamically under H. Even though the nature of the Schrödinger equation often results in these types of overall phase factors cancelling in physical observables, the detailed evolution of the state can still be affected, depending on the commutation relationship between K and H.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation f(ψ) = e^(iK) ψ to ψ_0 at t=0 and then evolving it under the Schrödinger equation leads to the same state ψ(t) at t=T as directly evolving ψ_0 under the Schrödinger equation from t=0 to t=T."
