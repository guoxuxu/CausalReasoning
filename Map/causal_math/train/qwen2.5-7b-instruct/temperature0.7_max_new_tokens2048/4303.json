  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanical system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a time-independent Hamiltonian H. We study the effect of applying a linear operator \\\\( U = e^{-iHt} \\\\) on the state vector at different times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a new operator \\\\( V = e^{-iGt} \\\\) (G being another Hamiltonian) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) still retain properties only influenced by H and not by G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( V \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new dynamic influenced by Hamiltonian G. This change impacts the evolution of the state vector, modifying the trajectory and resultant properties at time T. Thus, the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) will depend on both H and G.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
