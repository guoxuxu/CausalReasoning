  "Problem": "Analyze a complex dynamical system represented by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and z is a complex function. The evolution is studied under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nBy knowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) prior to applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), without additional data on whether the transformation was used?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), ambiguity remains about the initial conditions due to the potential modification induced by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). The presence of D, especially if it does not commute with C, may render \\\\( z_0 \\\\) indiscernible from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(T) is caused by the initial state z_0 through the transformation defined by the matrix C. Similarly, z(T) is also influenced by the transformation matrix D. Knowing z(T) at time T allows us to trace back to z_0 if only C is considered, but D introduces an additional layer of complexity that requires more information to determine z_0 uniquely."
