  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain z as \\\\( f(z) = c^z \\\\) for a constant c. Analyze how the Laplace transform impacts this function when converted using an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can one unambiguously retrieve the constant c used in the original function \\\\( f(z) = c^z \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The complex exponential nature and the constants in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) may yield similar transforms for different values of c due to the properties of exponential growth and decay, meaning the exact value of c cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform F(s) of the function f(z) depends on the constant c in f(z) = c^z, but knowing F(s) alone does not unambiguously determine c without additional information."
