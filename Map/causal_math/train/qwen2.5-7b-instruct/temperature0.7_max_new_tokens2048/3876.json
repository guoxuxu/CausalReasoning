  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of the operator \\\\( F(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where K is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the transformation matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we conclusively identify which interventions (either \\\\( F(x) \\\\), \\\\( G(x) \\\\), or both) were applied during the system’s evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specifics of interventions solely from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is extremely challenging. Given the effects of matrix exponential transformations involving S, K, and M and their potential non-commutative interactions, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could result from several different combinations of these interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
