  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) in a rod and time \\( t \\) obeys the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) with thermal conductivity \\( k \\). We investigate the application of a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(x,t)) \\) to convert spatial components of the heat distribution into the frequency domain at time \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nCan the original temperature distribution \\( T(x,0) \\) be precisely reconstructed from \\( T(x,T) \\) without knowing that \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the Fourier transform application, restoring the original \\( T(x,0) \\) from \\( T(x,T) \\) is not feasible. The transformation could complicate the back-propagation of the heat equation, obscuring the true initial state.",
