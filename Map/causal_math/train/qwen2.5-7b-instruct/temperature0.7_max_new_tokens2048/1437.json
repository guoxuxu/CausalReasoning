  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and z is a complex-valued function of time t. Investigate the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is another real constant, on the evolution of z.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and it then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T match that evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0. The evolution then differs because the state trajectory is scaled differently, affecting the amplitude and potentially the phase, changing the solution from the what would have been if no transformation were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k determines the form of the transformation g(z), which in turn affects the evolution of z over time. The constant ω dictates the rate of change of z with respect to time, and the initial condition z(0) influences the state of z at any later time t. Applying the transformation g(z) at t=0 changes the initial condition from z(0) to g(z(0)), thus altering the subsequent evolution of z compared to the case where z evolves directly under dz/dt = iωz."
