  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the function V(x), and governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\). We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(x)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\xi x} x(t) dt \\\\) on the trajectory of the particle.\n\nIf the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to the trajectory \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) and then the resulting function is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting trajectory, translated back via the inverse Fourier transform, yield the same trajectory as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation modifies the frequency components of the trajectory which affects how the differential equation governs the motion. The trajectory after inverse transformation will generally not be similar to the original trajectory due to these modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial trajectory x_0(t) directly causes the trajectory x(t) when evolved under the differential equation. Applying the Fourier transformation F to x_0(t) results in x'(t), which then evolves to x(t) under the same differential equation. The resulting trajectory x(t) from the transformed path x'(t) will be the same as evolving x_0(t) directly, assuming no additional interventions."
