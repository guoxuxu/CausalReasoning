  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and A is a complex constant. The transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B being another complex constant.\n\nIf at some instant \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is a complex constant) is applied, would the eventual state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely purely on A's influence, irrespective of B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new transformation effect at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), resulting in a system state at T that depends on the interplay of A, B, and C. The complex exponential transformations due to B and C, alongside A, contribute to the final state, revealing dependency on all variables.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
