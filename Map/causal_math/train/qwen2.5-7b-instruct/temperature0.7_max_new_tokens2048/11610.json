  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane function defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{f(z)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) and a, b, c are complex numbers. Investigate the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = dz + e \\\\) on z, where d and e are also complex numbers, on the mapping of the function w.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the value \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at any point z without knowing if transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The modification introduced by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the input to \\\\( w(z) \\\\) significantly due to the non-linear nature of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is fundamentally ambiguous, given the transformation may not be invertible in this setup.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z directly influences w through the function w(z) = e^(az^2 + bz + c). Applying the linear transformation T(z) = dz + e directly influences w by changing z to T(z), thus indirectly influencing w."
