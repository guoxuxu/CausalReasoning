  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system's evolution is governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a positive real constant.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) is given and the system evolves according to the differential equation without any intervention, will the magnitude \\\\( |z(t)| \\\\) remain constant for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z \\\\) corresponds to a simple rotation in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since the rotation preserves the magnitude, \\\\( |z(t)| \\\\) remains constant equal to \\\\( |z_0| \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The real part u(t) and the imaginary part v(t) of z(t) determine its magnitude |z(t)|; the imaginary constant ω influences the system's eigenvalue, which dictates the behavior of z(t); the initial condition z(0) sets the starting point for z(t)'s evolution."
