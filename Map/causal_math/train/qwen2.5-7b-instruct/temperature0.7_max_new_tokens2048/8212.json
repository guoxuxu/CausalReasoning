  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) and when, based solely on the information about \\\\( y(T) \\\\) and knowing matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of multiple matrix transformations and the integral dependency makes it difficult to definitively determine the history of interventions. The transformations could overlap in effects, making it challenging to distinguish whether and when \\\\( f(x) \\\\) or \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or both were applied, only from observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
