  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = -RI + E(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, I is the current, and E(t) is a time-varying electromotive force. An analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of adding a linear filter \\\\( f(I) = CI \\\\) where C is a constant, initially at time t = 0.\n\nGiven the observed current \\\\( I(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which filters (either \\\\( f(I) \\\\), \\\\( g(I) \\\\), or both) were used based on \\\\( I(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of filter applications (or none at all) could lead to the same observed current at T, making it impossible to uniquely identify whether and which filters were applied. Similar final conditions could result from different transformation histories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
