  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) representing a complex valued function, where \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), and \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real valued functions governed by the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = A u \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = B v \\). We further study the transformation by the integral operator \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{C s} z(s) ds \\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial function \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(T) \\) without knowing whether \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) \\), the transformations applied by \\( e^{C s} \\) make it unclear whether changes in \\( z(T) \\) arise directly from the natural evolution under \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) or from the influences of the integral operator. Deduction of \\( z_0 \\) is not feasible without this knowledge.",
