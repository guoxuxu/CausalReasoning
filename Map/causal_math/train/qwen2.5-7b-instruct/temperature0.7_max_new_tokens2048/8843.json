  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -kx\\\\), with a constant decay rate k. The impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\(L[f(t)](s)\\\\) on this system is explored, where \\\\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\\\). The transformation variable s is complex.\n\nIf a modification is introduced to the system where the decay rate is temporarily changed from k to \\\\(k'\\\\) during the interval [0, T] via an intervention, and then a Laplace transformation is applied, will the outcome of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T depend solely on the original rate k?",
  "Explanation": "Any such intervention that modifies the system's decay rate from k to \\\\(k'\\\\) changes the system's characteristics temporarily and thus alters the subsequent behavior of \\\\(x(t)\\\\). Even though the Laplace transformation analyzes the system globally, it reflects changes due to the modified decay rate within the transformation outcome, leading to a dependence on both k and \\\\(k'\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The decay rate k and the modified rate k' directly cause x(t), and the duration T influences x(t) through its effect on the decay rates."
