  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} + i \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-1)s} ds \\\\), where A is a constant and i represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of z when affected by transformation \\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\), where B is another constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original function at t=0 without knowing if transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied, the transformation can alter both magnitude and phase of z such that reverse-engineering to the exact original state \\( z(0) \\) is unattainable without additional information about B or the application of the transformation.",
