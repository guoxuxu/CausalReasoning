  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system governed by a vector field \\\\(V(z) = i\\\\beta z\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant. The transformation considered is \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, and t represents time.\n\nSuppose at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention is applied to the system with \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) is another complex constant). Will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new scaling and rotational dynamic because of \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), which affects the evolution post-intervention. Hence, the final state depends on the interaction between \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), and the field coefficient \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), altering the system's trajectory through complex scaling.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The vector field V(z) and the transformation f(z) determine the evolution of z over time, while an intervening transformation g(z) at time t_1 changes the state z(t) to z(T). The final state z(T) depends on β through V(z) and on α and γ through f(z) and g(z)."
