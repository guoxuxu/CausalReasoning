  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p \\\\dot{x} + qx = 0 \\\\), where p and q are constants. We introduce a Fourier transform of the displacement function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact form of the initial time-domain function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from its Fourier transform without adding any constraints or additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier transform is theoretically invertible, practical recovery of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from its transform generally requires additional information such as phase and initial conditions, especially if any filtering or modifications occurred during transformation.",
