  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) representing a complex valued function, where \\\\( z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\\\). We analyze the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ h(z) \\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) also belongs to the complex plane.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) with poles at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\), can we conclude that the original function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was purely sinusoidal?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of poles at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\) in \\\\( H(s) \\\\) suggests a sinusoidal component in \\\\( h(z) \\\\), but does not exclude the possibility of additional components such as damping factors or other sinusoids with different frequencies. The Laplace transform can represent a combination of effects, not just a single sinusoidal function.",
