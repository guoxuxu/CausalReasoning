  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. The function transforms using a Fourier Transform, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier Transform output that changed over time, can we determine if the change was due to a frequency shift from \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega\\\\) or another type of modification?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform only provides information about the frequency composition of a function. While a shift in the transform indicates a change in frequency, it does not uniquely identify the nature of the intervention, such as a simple shift or more complex frequency modulation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
