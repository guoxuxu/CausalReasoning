  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = xe^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. The transformation \\(\\ T : z \\mapsto z^2 \\) is applied to this function.\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention \\( I(z) = z + c \\) (where \\( c \\) is a constant) is applied, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) only depend on \\( \\\\omega \\) and not on the initial condition modified by \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( I(z) \\) changes the system, introducing a new constant \\( c \\) which modifies the trajectory furthermore. The final state \\( z(T) \\) will depend on both the original frequency \\( \\\\omega \\), the original transformation \\( T(z) = z^2 \\), and the intervention \\( I(z) \\), making the final state reliant on multiple factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The intervention I(z) → z modifies the value of z, which then → z^2 through the transformation T, and z^2 → z(T) represents the endpoint after applying the transformation T."
