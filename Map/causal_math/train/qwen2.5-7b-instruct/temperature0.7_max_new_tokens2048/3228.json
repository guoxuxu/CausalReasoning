  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), commonly referred to as the heat equation. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) = U(k, t) \\\\), is applied to the system.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( U(k, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we conclusively determine the type and nature of any intervention (such as variable conductivity) solely from \\\\( U(k, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence and effects of variable conductivity or any other intervention manifest as changes in the Fourier domain representation, but these changes may be indistinct or non-unique due to overlapping effects and the potential complexity of \\\\( k(x) \\\\). Consequently, multiple different interventions could yield similar or indistinguishable outcomes in \\\\( U(k, T) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine the intervention specifics just from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform to the function u(x, t) yields U(k, t), which then describes the system under the heat equation; knowing U(k, T) allows us to infer the state u(x, T) but does not provide information about specific interventions like variable conductivity."
