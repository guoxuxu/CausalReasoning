  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\). We explore the effects of a multiplied exponential function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and its corresponding Laplace transformation \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and then transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\), the transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) shifted by \\\\( a \\\\) in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and subsequent transformation correctly results in a domain shift. This follows from the property of the Laplace transform where multiplying by an exponential results in a shift in the s-domain, i.e., \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ e^{at} f(t) \\\\} (s) = F(s-a) \\\\).",
