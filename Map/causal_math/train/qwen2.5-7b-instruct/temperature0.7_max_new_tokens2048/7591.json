  "Problem": "Evaluate the system of differential equations characterized by the Laplace transform of functions and their inverse. Let \\\\( X(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of a function x(t), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) the transfer function of a linear system. The response of the system is given by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied to the system output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) affects the final system response by altering the overall system characteristics. The final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), as these transformations modify the output in sequence, impacting the frequency and time-domain characteristics of the response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the input signal X(s) directly influences the Laplace transform of the system response Y(s) through the transfer function H(s). Applying a filter G(s) to Y(s) results in a filtered Laplace transform Y_filtered(s), which then influences the filtered output y_filtered(t). The original output y(t) depends on Y(s), which in turn depends on H(s) and X(s), but not directly on G(s) unless G(s) is applied after the transformation to y(t)."
