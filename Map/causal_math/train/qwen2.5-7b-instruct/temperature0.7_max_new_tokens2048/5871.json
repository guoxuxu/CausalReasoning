  "Problem": "Analyze the causal effects in a control system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu \\\\) where \\\\(D\\\\) is a dynamics matrix and \\\\(B\\\\) is a control matrix. We study the influence of applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(Cx) \\\\) where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix to the state vector \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Fx} \\\\) (where \\\\(F\\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( C \\\\) and depend only on \\\\( D, B, \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a new transformation with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) further alters the state, combining effects of both the exponential and sinusoidal transformations; hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) integrates influences from \\\\( C, D, B, \\\\), and \\\\( F \\\\). The non-linear interactions and potentially non-commutative nature of these transformations make their independent effects inseparable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
