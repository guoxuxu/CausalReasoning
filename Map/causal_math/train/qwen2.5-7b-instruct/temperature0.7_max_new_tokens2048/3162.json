  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution along a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where k is a positive constant. We examine the effects of introducing a boundary condition modified at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\) over time t, such as \\\\( u(0,t) = u(0,t)e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the boundary condition was modified?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge about the modification of the boundary condition, it is not possible to accurately trace back to the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). The additional exponential factor introduced at the boundary could significantly alter the temperature distribution in a way that isn't deducible from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The boundary condition at x=0 influences the temperature distribution throughout the rod, and the initial temperature distribution also influences the temperature distribution throughout the rod over time."
