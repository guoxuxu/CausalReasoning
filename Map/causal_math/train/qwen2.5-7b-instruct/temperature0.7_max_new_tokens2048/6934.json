  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z \\), respectively. The evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( z(t) \\) at arbitrary \\( t_0 \\) after observing \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\( f(z) \\), recovering the exact original function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t_0 \\) is not feasible. The integral transformation \\( f(z) \\) can significantly alter the trajectory, and without knowing \\( N \\) and the specifics of its impact, the initial function is ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M governs the evolution of z(t), while N influences the integral transformation f(z). Knowing z(t) at t=T allows us to infer z(t0) if the transformation f(z) is not applied, as it directly relates z(t) to z(t0) through the given differential equation and integral transformation."
