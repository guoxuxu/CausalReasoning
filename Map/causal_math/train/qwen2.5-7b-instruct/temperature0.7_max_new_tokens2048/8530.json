  "Problem": "Consider a heat conduction process governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( u_t \\) and \\( u_{xx} \\) denote the temporal and spatial second derivatives of \\( u \\) respectively, and \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The initial condition is \\( u(x, 0) = \\phi(x) \\). Analysis involves examining the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(s, t) \\) applied at t = 0.\n\nCan we reconstruct \\( \\phi(x) \\) perfectly from \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\) at t = T if no additional information is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\), the Fourier inversion theorem allows the exact reconstruction of \\( u(x, T) \\), and since the solution depends linearly on \\( \\phi(x) \\), \\( \\phi(x) \\) can be determined from \\( u(x, T) \\) given the boundary and initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
