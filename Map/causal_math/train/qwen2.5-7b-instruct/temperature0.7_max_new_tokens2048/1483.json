  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario, where the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined by a Fourier transform of another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), specifically \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-izt} dt \\\\). We examine the implications of changing the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) represents a delta function.\n\nIf an intervention is applied through an additional linear filtering function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the resulting transform still be fundamentally different from that of the unmodified \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through filtering (convolution with \\\\( f(t) \\\\)) will affect both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\). Since convolution with a delta function translates the other function, the impact of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) on the baseline and on the impulse will propagate differently, resulting in a transform distinct from any possible scenario without the addition of \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The original function g(t) directly influences the Fourier transform h(z). The modified function g(t) + δ(t) directly influences the transformed function h'(z). The linear filtering function f(t) directly affects g(t) + δ(t). If f(t) is not the identity function, then h(z) is fundamentally different from h'(z)."
