  "Problem": "A vector field $V(z)$ in the complex plane behaves according to the equation $V(z) = z^n$ where $n$ is an integer. We examine the consequences of applying a transformation $f(z) = e^{i \\theta}z$ where $\\theta$ is a constant angle.\n\nIf $f(z)$ is applied to a complex number $z_0$ and then $V(z)$ operates under $V(z) = z^n$ without further intervention, will $V(z(t))$ at $t = T$ be the same as if $z_0$ was directly evolved under $V(z) = z^n$?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation $f(z)$ by multiplying by $e^{i \\theta}$ changes the initial conditions by rotating the vector in the complex plane. Since $V(z) = z^n$ raises any vector to the power of $n$, a rotation beforehand results in a different value due to the properties of complex exponentiation with varying angles.",
