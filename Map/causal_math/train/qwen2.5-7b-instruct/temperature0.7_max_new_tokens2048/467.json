  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, representing the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( A \\\\). We evaluate the effects of applying Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a modification by a linear transformation \\\\( z(t) := Dz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix is applied at a certain \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the subsequent Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depict effects caused solely by \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the matrix \\\\( D \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) thus affecting the resultant Fourier transform. As a consequence, the frequencies represented in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) are influenced by both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), reflecting composite effects of the original and intervening transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a linear transformation D to z(t) at time t1 changes z(t) from its original form governed by A. Subsequent Fourier transform F(z) at time T > t1 reflects the effects of both A and D."
