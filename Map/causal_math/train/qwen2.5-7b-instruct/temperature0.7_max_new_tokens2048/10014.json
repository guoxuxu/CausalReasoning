  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on the solution, specifically, the operation defined by the function g(u) = F(u), where F denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the Fourier transform, it's unclear whether we are interpreting the solution in the time-space or frequency domain. Each domain requires different considerations for the operator L, leading to potentially different initial conditions (u_0).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(t) at time t = T causally influences the original function u_0 at t = 0 through the inverse Fourier transform, and the Fourier transform of u causally influences u(t) at any time t."
