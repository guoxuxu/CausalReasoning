  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), showing simple harmonic motion in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. Let's investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\) applied to z(t).\n\nIf an additional damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha \\) is a constant) is introduced at time t = t1, modifying the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), will the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T > t1 reflect only the changes due to \\\\( \\alpha \\) and not \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) adds to the effect of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T registers effects of both the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the damping \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), altering its computation and the resulting integral. Both parameters shape the outcome.",
