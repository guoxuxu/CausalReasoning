  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\). A transformation is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z \\\\) was applied, determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is challenging. The unknown phase shift could alter the trajectory significantly, making it impossible to reverse-engineer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely.",
