  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex number. This system is analyzed in terms of the impact of the Laplace transform on the evolution of this function over time.\n\nGiven the system's state at T, can we precisely identify what interventions (e.g., application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)) occurred, based solely on the system's behavior at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions could result in the same or similar observed behavior at T, especially with continuous transformations and without precise timestamps or parameters of interventions. The resulting ambiguities in the exponential components mean identifying specific interventions merely from the end state is generally not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z_0 → z(t); ω → z(t); z(t) → T",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 and the angular frequency ω directly cause the system's state z(t) at any given time; the system's state z(t) at time T indicates the evolution influenced by z_0 and ω."
