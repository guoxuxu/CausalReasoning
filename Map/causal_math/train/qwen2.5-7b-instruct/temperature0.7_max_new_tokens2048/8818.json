  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system described by a Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) defined as \\\\(f(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(s) e^{ist} ds\\\\). The scenario explores how manipulations to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) affect the outcome of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over an interval.\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at any arbitrary time T, can one reliably infer whether a polynomial term was added to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation produced by the Fourier integral, especially without complete information about the function over the entire interval, can lead to different functions \\\\( g(s) \\\\) that could conceivably yield similar \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Therefore, it's challenging to deduce the presence of a specific modification like a polynomial term just from \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifications to g(s) directly influence the Fourier transform f(t), but knowing f(t) at a single point T does not reliably infer specific changes made to g(s) such as the addition of a polynomial term without additional information."
