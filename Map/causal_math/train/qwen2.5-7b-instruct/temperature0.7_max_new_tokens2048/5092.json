  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a system matrix and B is a control matrix, coupled with a control input u. We analyze the impact of applying a state-dependent transformation \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original transformation (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied or not) and the magnitude or type of control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original transformation and control inputs solely based on the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the multiple influences (system dynamics, initial transformation, and control strategy) contributing to the final state. Different combinations of initial conditions, transformations, and control inputs may yield the same final state, creating unresolvable ambiguity without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u directly influences the rate of change of the state x (u → dx/dt), the system matrix A also directly influences the rate of change of the state x (A → dx/dt), the state transformation Cx results in the state x (Cx → x), and the state x at time T is the final state (x → x(T))."
