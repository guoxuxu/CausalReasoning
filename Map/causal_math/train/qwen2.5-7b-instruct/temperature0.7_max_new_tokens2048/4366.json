  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in integral calculus defined as \\\\( u = g(x) \\\\) where g is a continuously differentiable function. We analyze the impact of changing variables from x to u in the definite integral \\\\( \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( du = g'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(g^{-1}(u)) \\\\frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(u))} \\\\, du \\\\), without additional transformations, can we determine the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and limits a, and b?",
  "Explanation": "While we might know the transformed function and transformed limits, without the specific form of the function g or its inverse, we cannot uniquely determine the function f(x) or the original limits a and b. The resulting integral provides limited back-inference capability about the original function and limits.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral with respect to u is equivalent to the integral with respect to x after applying the change of variables formula, where the function f is transformed, the limits of integration are adjusted via g, and the differential dx is replaced by du/g'(g^{-1}(u))."
