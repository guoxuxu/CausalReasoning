  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x, y, t) + iv(x, y, t) \\\\), a complex-valued function of two spatial variables and time, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions.\n\nGiven the knowledge of the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine which specific interventions were used (such as the application of k(x, y) or others), solely based on the endpoint state?",
  "Explanation": "Because complex systems can evolve in ways where different interventions might produce similar or idiosyncratic effects owing to their specific influences and interactions with the original conditions, identifying specific interventions used solely by endpoint analysis is often infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
