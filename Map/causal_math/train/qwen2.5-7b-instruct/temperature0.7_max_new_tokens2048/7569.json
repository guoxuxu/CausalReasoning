  "Problem": "Consider a set of functions defined by complex mappings \\\\( z = f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) where w is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit. The system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(w(t)) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) = g + ht \\\\) where g and h are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is applied to a constant complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( w(t) = w_0 + ht \\\\) without further changes, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from simply evolving \\\\( w_0 \\\\) under \\\\( w(t) = w_0 + ht \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(w) \\\\) transforms the initial value from the linear real domain into the complex exponential, introducing periodic and oscillatory properties. As such, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) reflects both these properties and the linear real progression, making it different from merely a linear projection from the initial point.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "g and h determine w(t), which influences z(t); w_0 at t=0 evolves to w(t) over time; T specifies when z(t) is evaluated, showing z(t) depends on both w(t) and the evolution time t."
