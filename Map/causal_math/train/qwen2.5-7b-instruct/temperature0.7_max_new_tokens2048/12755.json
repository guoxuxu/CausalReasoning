  "Problem": "Consider the evaluation of the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\\\cos(tx) \\\\, dx \\\\) changing the variable x through the transformation \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants and analyzing the impact on the function's behaviour.\n\nKnowing the final integral result after several interventions, including shifting and scaling by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), and changing the function form, can we determine what specific transformations were made?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome from the integral transformation after multiple interventions is influenced by each step's specifics, which can cause similar effects in the integral's value. Given the multiplicity and variability in how each parameter can affect the result, determining the exact transformations from the integral's final value is implausible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constants a and b shift the variable x, thereby altering the integral I; the variable t scales the frequency of the cosine function within the integral I."
