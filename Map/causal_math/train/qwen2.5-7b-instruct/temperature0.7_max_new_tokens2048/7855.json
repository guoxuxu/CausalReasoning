  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine how an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, affects the system.\n\nIf an intervention using a differential modification \\\\( D(z) = dz/dt - E z \\\\) (where E is a constant matrix) is applied at time t = t_1, will \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) be unaffected by the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the differential equations controlling u and v, making the final state depend on the new dynamics introduced by E as well as the original matrices A and B. Therefore, \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) is affected by all these matrices.",
