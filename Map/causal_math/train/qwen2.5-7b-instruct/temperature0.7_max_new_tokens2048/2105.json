  "Problem": "Analyzing a system governed by a set of differential equations, \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and \\(u\\) represents an external control input related via the transformation \\\\(u(t) = D(t)z + E(t)\\) where D and E are matrix functions of time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(u(t) = D(t)z + E(t)\\\\) is initially applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu\\\\) without further changes to \\\\(D(t)\\\\) or \\\\(E(t)\\\\), will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for some T > 0 purely depend on the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Although the initial conditions are set by the transformation, the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time is dynamically influenced by both M and N through the external control \\(u\\), which itself evolves with \\(z\\). The dependency on \\(D(t)\\) and \\(E(t)\\) over the interval also influences the behavior of \\(u(t)\\) and thus \\(z(T)\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(t) at any time t depends on the initial transformation u(0) through D(t) and E(t), and this relationship persists as long as D(t) and E(t) remain unchanged."
