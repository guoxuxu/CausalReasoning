  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the implications of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the knowledge of the solution \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can we deduce whether the change in the constant \\\\( R \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) occurred, assuming no knowledge of the system's behavior between \\\\( 0 \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying a specific intervention like the addition of \\\\( R \\\\) to the differential equation without observing the entire trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is challenging. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be influenced by various other transformations and interventions, rendering a unique identification of the change by \\\\( R \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The change in the constant R at t_1 influences z(t_1), and the value of z(T) can be used to infer z(t_1) given the governing differential equation."
