  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane \\\\( z \\\\) described by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. We explore the effects on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) when \\\\( z \\\\) is transformed by a linear function \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are constants) is applied at some point during the computation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the original parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) of the first transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) still influence the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new transformation, however, the effects of the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\) remain encoded in the intermediate state. Both transformations will influence the final result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), as each transformation changes the input to \\\\( f \\\\) in a layered manner.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
