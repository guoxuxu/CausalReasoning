  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The system is analyzed under the transformation defined by the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-At^2} \\\\).\n\nIf a new function \\\\( y(t) = e^{-Ct} \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention after computing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[h(t)] \\\\), will the new resultant function depend only on A and not C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new function \\\\( y(t) = e^{-Ct} \\\\) adds complexity based on the new matrix C, integrating into the existing transformed state brought about by A. The outcome would depend on both matrices A and C, potentially altering the behavior and final output of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(z) depends on A, the Fourier transform F[h(t)] depends on A and h(t), and y(t) depends on C. Applying y(t) as an intervention after computing F[h(t)] results in y(t) depending on both A and C, but the resultant function primarily reflects the effect of A through F[h(t)]."
