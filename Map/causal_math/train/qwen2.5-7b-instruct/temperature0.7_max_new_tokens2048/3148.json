  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x(s) ds\\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and x(t) is a variable dependent on t. We explore the change in z(t) due to the Laplace transform \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t))(s) \\\\) and its inverse.\n\nGiven the end result \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether using A, B or both in the Laplace domain), only by looking at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations in the Laplace domain can result in similar or differing time-domain representations depending on their properties and interaction. Since these transformations may affect the resulting function in non-distinct ways due to overlapping effects, it is challenging to uniquely pinpoint the exact transformations used solely from the final outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
