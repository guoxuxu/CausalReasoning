  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) acting on a function space, defined as \\( L[f](x) = \\int_0^x k(x, t) f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a kernel function. We analyze the impact of a multiplying factor \\( g(x) \\) on the function \\( f(x) \\) before applying the operator.\n\nGiven \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\), can we deduce precisely whether \\( h(x) \\) was formed by multiplying \\( f(x) \\) with \\( g(x) \\) or if \\( g(x) \\) was applied after applying \\( L \\) to \\( f(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\) does not retain separate information about the functions \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) that can be distinctly recovered, especially since the integral transformation mixes the effects of \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) with the kernel \\( k \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear operator L to f(x) results in L[f](x), which can be transformed by g(x) to produce h(x). The value of L[h](T) does not distinguish whether g(x) was applied before or after L was applied to f(x)."
