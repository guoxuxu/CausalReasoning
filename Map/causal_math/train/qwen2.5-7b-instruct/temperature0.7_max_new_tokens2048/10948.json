  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\( z(t) \\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\) applied to this system, where \\( k \\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we accurately determine the specific interventions applied (neither, either \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) by knowing \\( z(T) \\) and assuming initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The complex interactions between \\( i \\omega \\), \\( k \\), and \\( c \\) mean that identical states \\( z(T) \\) could result from different combinations of interventions and parameters. The trajectory of \\( z(T) \\) does not uniquely determine which transformations and parameters were utilized.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω directly causes the time derivative of z (z'); the complex constant k directly causes the transformation f(z); the time T directly causes the value of z at time T (z(T))."
