  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influenced by an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')dt' \\\\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\), without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had been initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Because the transformation involves integration and an exponential modifier that alters the beginning state, the exact initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be recovered uniquely only from \\\\( z(T) \\\\); the presence and the nature of the integral transformation impact the back-tracing of initial conditions without prior knowledge of its application.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (z'(t)) directly causes z to increase over small time intervals (z(t+dt)). The initial value of z (z(0)) determines z(t) at any given time t. Complex constants A and B directly cause z'(t). The constant C directly causes the integral transformation f(z). The value of z(t) influences the result of the integral transformation f(z)."
