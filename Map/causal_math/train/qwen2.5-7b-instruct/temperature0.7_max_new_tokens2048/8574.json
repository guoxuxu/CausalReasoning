  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are complex variables and the function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\). Here, A and B are constant matrices. We assess how the sequence of partial differentiation with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) and their integrations influence the outcome.\n\nGiven the transformed function after differentiation and integration, can we uniquely determine the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The loss of information during integration (constants of integration) and the non-commutative nature of the matrix exponentiation can obscure the original matrix values, making it impossible to uniquely recover A and B from transformations alone.",
