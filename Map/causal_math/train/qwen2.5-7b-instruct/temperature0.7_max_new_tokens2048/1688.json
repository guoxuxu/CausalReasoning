  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagation described by the second order partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial t^2 = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) with a perturbation function \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants.\n\nKnowing the wave profile \\\\(u(T)\\\\) at time T, can we reliably identify the interventions applied (whether \\\\(f(u)\\\\), \\\\(g(u)\\\\), or none) from the wave dynamics observed?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both the initial function and the intervention alter the wave profile in a non-trivial and overlapping manner through exponential factors, it is not feasible to definitively trace back the specific interventions used only based on the final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\). The reliance on external factors like \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) creates a complex dynamic that obfuscates definite causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The wave profile u at time T is influenced by the perturbation function f(u), and knowing u(T) allows us to infer the impact of f(u) on the wave dynamics."
