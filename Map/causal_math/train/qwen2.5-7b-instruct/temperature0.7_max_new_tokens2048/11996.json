  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The complex function transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) is initially applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and allowed to evolve according to the PDE without any intervention, will the resulting \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) at time T be purely determined by the operator L?",
  "Explanation": "While L governs the evolution of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) introduces the factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), altering the solution due to the multiplication by a time-dependent exponential term. This complex exponential can affect the solution's behavior, not solely predicted by L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function u(x,0) evolves over time t under the operator L to become u(x,t), which then transforms into v(x,t) through the relation v(x,t) = e^(iωt)u(x,t). Thus, v(x,T) at time T is determined by L and the initial condition u(x,0)."
