  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\), where A is a constant matrix and x is a constant complex vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transformation given by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention is made where the vector \\( x \\) is modified to \\( x + \\delta \\) where \\( \\delta \\) is a small constant vector, will \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( \\delta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\delta \\) as an intervention directly alters the trajectory starting at \\( t_1 \\), resulting in a different \\( z(t) \\) post-intervention and consequently a modified \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}(x + \\delta) \\). This change indicates dependency on both \\( A \\) and \\( \\delta \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform L{z(t)}(s) depends on A and x, but after time t1, it does not directly depend on the small perturbation δ applied to x."
