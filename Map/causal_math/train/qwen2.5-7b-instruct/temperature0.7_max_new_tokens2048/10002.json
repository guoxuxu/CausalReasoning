  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) with an initial input \\( z_0 \\). The system undergoes a transformation \\( h(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Et}z dt \\), where E is a constant matrix and T is the final time.\n\nAfter observing \\( z(T) \\), can we infer the initial state \\( z_0 \\) without knowing whether the transformation \\( h(z) \\) was applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( h(z) \\) and considering the effects of the integration and matrix exponential \\( e^{Et} \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine the original state \\( z_0 \\) because the initial conditions could have been modified in various ways by the integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
