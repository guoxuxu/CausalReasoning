  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\( V(x, t) \\), such that \\( i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\\\\psi \\). We explore how applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi(x, t)) \\\\) affects the wave function over time.\n\nGiven the state \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\) at time T, can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the Fourier transform, changes in potential, or both), only by knowing the state at \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\) could be achieved through different potential changes or transformations due to the diverse ways in which these factors interact. Therefore, without specific initial or intermediary information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The potential function V(x, t) directly influences the wave function ψ(x, t). The state of the wave function ψ(x, T) at time T directly influences its state at any future time ψ(x, t). The wave function ψ(x, t) evolves over time to become ψ(x, t+Δt)."
