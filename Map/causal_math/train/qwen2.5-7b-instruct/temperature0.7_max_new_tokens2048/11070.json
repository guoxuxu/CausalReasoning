  "Problem": "Analyze the heat distribution in a rod over time governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity coefficient. Consider an intervention where a heating element applies a periodic thermal function \\\\( p(x) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) at a specific location along the rod.\n\nGiven the heat distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t, can we determine the exact initial heat distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) knowing only the heat equation and the diffusivity k?",
  "Explanation": "While the general characteristics of the initial distribution can be inferred, precise recovery of \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is mathematically ill-posed without additional constraints or data due to potential loss of information over time, such as phase and amplitude decay.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The periodic thermal function p(x) influences the temperature distribution u(x,t) over time. The thermal diffusivity coefficient k determines the rate of change of the second spatial derivative of temperature with respect to position. The partial derivative of temperature with respect to time is directly caused by the second spatial derivative of temperature."
