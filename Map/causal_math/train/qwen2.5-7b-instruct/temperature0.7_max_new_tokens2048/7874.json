  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and x is a constant vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We explore how different transformations influence the behavior of function z over time using the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to simplify the analysis.\n\nGiven the output of function z at time T, can we unambiguously determine the original vector x if we do not know whether transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial transformation using \\\\( h(x) \\\\), we cannot reverse the process uniquely to obtain the original x, because transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could have altered the initial state in a way that makes it non-identifiable due to exponential behavior of complex matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
