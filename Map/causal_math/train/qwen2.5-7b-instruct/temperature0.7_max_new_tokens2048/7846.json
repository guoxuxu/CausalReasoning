  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Let \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition and \\\\( F(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, represents an integral transformation applied to \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied, reconstructing the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) becomes ambiguous. The potential modification by \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) at t = 0 means the original condition could have been one of multiple possible states depending on the specifics of the exponential matrix \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(x, T) → u(x, 0); L → ∂u/∂t; u_0(x) → u(x, 0); M → F(u)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of u(x, T) at time T causally influences the original state u(x, 0) at time 0 through the evolution governed by the PDE. The operator L determines how u changes with respect to time, and the initial condition u_0(x) sets the starting point for this evolution. Applying the transformation F(u) with matrix M modifies u but does not affect the causal relationship between u(x, T) and u(x, 0) if F(u) is known."
