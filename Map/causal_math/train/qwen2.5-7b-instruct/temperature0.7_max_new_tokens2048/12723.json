  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving in time according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. The system's evolution is further examined under an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Ps} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) were used, based purely on knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were applied based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is inherently ambiguous; the effects of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) might overlap or mask each other due to properties of complex integrals and exponentials. The final state alone lacks sufficient information for distinct identification of the paths taken to reach it.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z(t) evolves over time to become z(T) through the differential equation. The parameter P determines the rate of change dz/dt. Applying the transformation T(z) results in z(T). Knowing z(T) alone does not uniquely determine whether T(z) or U(z) or both were applied."
