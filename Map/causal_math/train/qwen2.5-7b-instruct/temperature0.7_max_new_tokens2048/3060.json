  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nCan we precisely infer the specific time and the type of interventions, such as the application of a Fourier transform, applied during the evolution from observing the population distribution at a later time \\\\( t_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature and timing of interventions like a Fourier transform solely from the population distribution at a later time is highly challenging due to the diffusion process's tendency to smear out details and the potential variety of equivalent transformation effects possible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion process driven by the diffusion coefficient D transforms the initial population distribution u(x, t) over time, and applying a Fourier transform F(u) to the population distribution at a specific moment results in the population distribution at a later time t_2."
