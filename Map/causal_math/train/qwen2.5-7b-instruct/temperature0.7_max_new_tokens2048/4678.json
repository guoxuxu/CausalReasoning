  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), a complex exponential where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real parameter representing frequency. We inspect the behavior of this function under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) over domain \\\\( x \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(X) = T(z(x)) \\\\) at some \\\\( x = X \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), reversing the effect of \\\\( T \\\\) to decipher \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(X) \\\\) is impossible. Knowing \\\\( z(X) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to account for the scaling and shifting introduced by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), which critically affect the original function's form.",
