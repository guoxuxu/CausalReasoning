  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and the function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane. This function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) which is the Laplace transform, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf a modification is made by changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform still be a clear function of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) without any signs of \\\\( \\delta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by modifying \\\\( \\omega \\\\) alters the exponential term in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which directly affects the Laplace transform. The new parameter \\\\( \\delta \\\\) combined with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) results in a different decay or growth rate in the exponential term, hence the resultant transform reflects both \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changing ω to ω + δ at time t1 directly modifies z(t) and consequently changes L{z(t)}, introducing the effect of δ into the Laplace transform."
