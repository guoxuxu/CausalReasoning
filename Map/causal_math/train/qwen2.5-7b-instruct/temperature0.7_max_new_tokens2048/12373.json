  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \\\\) over a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with a boundary condition \\\\( u = f \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). We examine the result of initial transformations using the eigenfunction expansions of \\\\( u \\\\) and how tool-based interventions like Laplacian solvers act.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at some point within \\\\( D \\\\), can we accurately identify if the Fourier transform was applied to \\\\( f \\\\) before it was used as a boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the initial form of \\\\( f \\\\) or the direct observation of boundary conditions, the resultant field \\\\( u \\\\) inside \\\\( D \\\\) does not uniquely specify whether \\\\( f \\\\) was Fourier transformed due to the potential similarity in solutions stemming from variably transformed boundary conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The boundary condition f is expanded into eigenfunctions to form u; the eigenfunction expansions of u are processed by Laplacian solvers to produce u."
