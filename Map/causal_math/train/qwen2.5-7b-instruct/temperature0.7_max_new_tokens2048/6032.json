  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the input voltage \\( V(t) \\) is transformed by a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) resulting in \\( V(s) \\). The transformed system is characterized by the impulse response function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s + R} \\), where \\( R \\) is a resistance in the circuit. The transformation represents an operation over the input voltage.\n\nGiven the modified output voltage \\( V_{out}(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+C)(s+R)} \\) at \\( s = R \\), can we determine precisely the interventions used (whether in the form of added components \\( C \\), alterations to \\( R \\), or both), solely by knowing the modified value of \\( V_{out}(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same transformed output \\( V_{out}(s) \\) could result from different configurations of resistances and other additional components. As s-domain expressions can correspond to multiple time-domain inputs or circuit alterations, uniquely identifying the specific modifications from \\( V_{out}(s) \\) alone is infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
