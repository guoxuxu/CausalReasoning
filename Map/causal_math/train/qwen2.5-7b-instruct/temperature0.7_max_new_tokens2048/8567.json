  "Problem": "Consider the operation of complex integration along a contour in the complex plane defined by \\\\\n\nIf a specific transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^n \\\\) (where \\\\( n \\\\) is a non-zero integer) is applied to the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) within the integral, and then a pole is introduced, does this solely affect the integral by the power \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformation modifies how \\\\( f(z) \\\\) behaves, introducing a pole still adds a residue to the integral that depends on the nature of the pole and its order, not just the transformation power \\\\( n \\\\). The effect on the integral involves both the transformation and the characteristics of the new pole.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation g(z) = z^n to f(z) changes the function being integrated; introducing a pole affects the integral by potentially altering its value based on the residue at the pole."
