  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) defined over complex numbers, and its transformation over time t using \\\\( T(p(z)) = \\\\int_0^t e^{z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nSuppose an intervention by applying a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z^2} \\\\) at a certain time \\( t_1 \\). Will the value of \\\\( T(p(z)) \\\\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) be effectively reset or significantly altered by \\( h(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( h(z) = e^{-z^2} \\) counteracts the effects of the original function \\( g(z) \\), potentially nullifying or reversing the accumulated effect by the time \\( t_1 \\), drastically affecting the endpoint \\( T(p(z)) \\) at \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying h(z) at time t_1 will not significantly alter the value of T(p(z)) for T > t_1 because T(p(z)) is defined by the integral of g(z) from 0 to t, and h(z) is applied after the integration period has begun."
