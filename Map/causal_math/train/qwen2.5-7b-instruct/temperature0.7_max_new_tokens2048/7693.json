  "Problem": "Consider a functional analysis scenario where we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We apply a Laplace transform to both x and y: \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) = Y(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an initial perturbation is applied to the function z(t) at t = 0, and then the system is left to evolve without any further intervention, will the output in the s-domain, \\\\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\\\), at a later time be the same as the unperturbed system?",
  "Explanation": "The initial perturbation affects the initial conditions of x(t) and y(t), which alters their corresponding Laplace transforms, X(s) and Y(s). Since Z(s) directly depends on X(s) and Y(s), any change in these transforms will change the output Z(s). The perturbation essentially modifies the trajectory in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "initial perturbation → change in x(t); initial perturbation → change in y(t); change in x(t) → X(s); change in y(t) → Y(s)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An initial perturbation directly causes changes in x(t) and y(t), which in turn cause changes in X(s) and Y(s) respectively."
