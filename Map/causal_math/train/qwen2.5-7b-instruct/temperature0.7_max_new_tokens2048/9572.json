  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\), where we transform the coordinates according to the functions \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = e^{Bt}y_0 \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. We analyze the dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\) over time under these transformations.\n\nGiven the observed value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the nature of the interventions (original transformations or modified by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\)), based solely on the value at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different transformations and interventions applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Without specific knowledge about the rate constants (A, B, C, D) and their timings, it's not feasible to uniquely back-calculate and determine the series of transformations applied throughout the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
