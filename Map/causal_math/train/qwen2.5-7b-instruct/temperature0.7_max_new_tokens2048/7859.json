  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) and its application within a Laplace Transform context \\\\(F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt\\\\). This scenario explores how the transformation behaves under varying conditions and manipulations.\n\nIf a regularization method (like the Hadamard finite part) is applied to \\\\(f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\) before calculating \\\\(F(s)\\\\), and then \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is computed, will the resulting Laplace Transform still indicate a divergence?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the underlying problem from an inherently divergent integral to a possibly convergent or well-defined scenario through regularization. Such methods adjust the behavior around singularities, potentially yielding finite and meaningful results in the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of a regularization method to f(t) = 1/t before computing F(s) prevents divergence, thus F(s) does not indicate a divergence."
