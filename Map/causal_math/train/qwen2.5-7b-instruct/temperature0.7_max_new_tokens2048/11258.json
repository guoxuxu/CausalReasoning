  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which is a solution to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We further investigate the influence of Laplace transform \\\\( L(z(t)) = Z(s) \\\\) and its inversion on the temporal behavior of z(t), focusing on variations caused by matrix modifications.\n\nCan we retrieve the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of the system at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\) without considering whether the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system is linear and time-invariant, and knowing \\\\( P \\\\), one can accurately compute \\\\( z_0 \\\\) using the reverse transformation from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The Laplace transform's linearity and reversibility ensure we can infer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of the system z(t) at time t=0 is determined by its value at any time t=T, and the time T at which z(t) is observed influences the retrieval of the initial state z_0."
