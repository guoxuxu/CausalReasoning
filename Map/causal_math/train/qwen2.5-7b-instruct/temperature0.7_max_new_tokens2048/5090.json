  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a system matrix and B is a control matrix, coupled with a control input u. We analyze the impact of applying a state-dependent transformation \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T having no knowledge whether transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied initially, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information about whether \\\\( Cx_0 \\\\) or just \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was the initial condition creates ambiguity. Without knowing if the transformation occurred, or the exact nature of C (unless it is the identity matrix), the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
