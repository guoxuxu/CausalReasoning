  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + z u_x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex constant. Examine the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) in modifying the system dynamics.\n\nIf a secondary transformation, say a Fourier transform, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, does the solution at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original characteristics of the PDE without considering the effects of the transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The application of another transformation, such as the Fourier transform, introduces additional complexity to the solution by modifying different aspects (like spatial frequency components), thereby making the final solution dependent not only on the original PDE but also on the effects of both transformations (Laplace and Fourier).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u_t → u; z → u; L[f](s) → transformed_u; Fourier_transform → transformed_u",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of u with respect to time (u_t) directly causes changes in u. The complex constant z directly causes changes in u. The Laplace transform (L[f](s)) transforms the function u over time to produce a transformed version of u. Applying a Fourier transform at time t_1 introduces a new state (transformed_u) that depends on the original characteristics of the PDE but also incorporates the effects of the transforms."
