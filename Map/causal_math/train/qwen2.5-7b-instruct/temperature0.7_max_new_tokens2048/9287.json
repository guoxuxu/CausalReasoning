  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different function \\\\( j(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the function value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( j(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) further introduces a new modifying factor, meaning the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). The compounding effects of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) through their exponential contributions change both phase and magnitude, altering the trajectory and endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function value z(T) at time T > t_1 depends directly on the rate of change z'(t) = iAz(t) and indirectly through the interventions h(z) = e^{iBt}z and j(z) = e^{iCt}z, but the ultimate dependency on A remains unchanged."
