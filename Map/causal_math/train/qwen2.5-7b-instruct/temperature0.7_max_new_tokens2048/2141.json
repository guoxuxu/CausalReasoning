  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where initial data points are mapped in a complex plane according to the function \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( i \\\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant, and \\\\\\( t \\\\\\) is time. We examine the effect of another transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\\\) introduced as an intervention, where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) is not applied and the data points evolve solely under \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\) over time \\\\\\( t \\\\\\), will the magnitude of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\) only involves rotation of the vector \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) in the complex plane, maintaining its magnitude. The scalar magnitude is not affected by the rotational motion about the origin, thus remaining constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The magnitude of z(t) remains constant over time t if z_0 and ω are fixed, as ω only affects the phase not the magnitude."
