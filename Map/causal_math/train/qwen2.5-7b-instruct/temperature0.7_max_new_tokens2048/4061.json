  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\}(s) = F(s)\\\\). We evaluate how a convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) impacts the transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then transformed, is the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the Laplace domain. Thus, convolving \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) results in the Laplace transform being shifted by \\\\( a \\\\), which indeed results in \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\). There are no additional time-dependent changes because the transform shift is calculated instantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(t) = e^(-at), when convolved with f(t) and then transformed using the Laplace transform, results in a shift in the transform F(s) by +a, i.e., F(s+a). This shift is caused by the constant a."
