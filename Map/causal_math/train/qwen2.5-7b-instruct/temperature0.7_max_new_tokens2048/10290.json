  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) which is a complex exponential representing oscillatory behavior with a constant \\\\( C \\\\) and angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\). An operator \\\\( T \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as follows: \\\\( Tz(t) = z(t + h) \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a time-shift constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the operator \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\), the unknown shift (or lack thereof) creates ambiguity in determining the original state, as the phase shift introduced by \\\\( T \\\\) cannot be distinguished from natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the operator T shifts the function z(t) by T units of time, so z(t+T) represents the value of z(t) at a later time. Without knowledge of T, the original function z(0) cannot be uniquely deduced from z(T); z(0) → z(h) indicates a shift but does not provide enough information for reverse calculation."
