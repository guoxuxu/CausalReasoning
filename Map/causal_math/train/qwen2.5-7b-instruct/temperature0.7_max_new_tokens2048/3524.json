  "Problem": "A system is controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We assess the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nBased on the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the specific interventions (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) be precisely identified by only knowing the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential for overlapping effects from the transformations \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) and their non-linear interactions with the system's dynamics under M, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could correspond to multiple intervention scenarios. Identifying which transformations took place based solely on the final result is not feasible without additional contextual information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
