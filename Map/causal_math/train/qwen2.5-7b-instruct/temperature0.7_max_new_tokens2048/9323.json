  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We evaluate the effect of a Fourier transform applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0) = u_0(x)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by an inverse Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}[U(k,T)]\\\\) is applied at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be the same as if no Fourier transform were initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of the original Fourier transform at t = 0 and the subsequent inverse Fourier transform at \\\\(t_1\\\\) will not typically negate each other due to the evolution under the differential equation, which depends on A. This non-trivial evolution affects the final state and does not guarantee a simple reversal of the initial Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) influences u(x,t), and applying a Fourier transform on U(k,0) yields U(k,t). An inverse Fourier transform on U(k,t) at time t_1 results in u(x,t) which, if T > t_1, can be different from u(x,t) without the Fourier transform."
