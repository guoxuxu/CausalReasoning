  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u(x, t), resulting in \\\\(U(k, t)\\\\).\n\nCan the original function u(x,0) be accurately reconstructed from observing \\\\(U(k, T)\\\\) at t = T, without knowing the changes effected by L transformed in Fourier space?",
  "Explanation": "Without a precise knowledge of how the operator L affects the system in the Fourier space over time, reconstructing the exact initial state u(x,0) just from the data at later times is theoretically infeasible due to potential losses or modifications in the information throughout the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(x,0) transforms into U(k,t) via the Fourier transform, and observing U(k,T) at time t=T allows reconstruction of u(x,T) through the inverse Fourier transform."
