  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We introduce a control function \\\\( h(x,t) = Kx \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, to modify the system's state.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( q(x) = Mx \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) introduce modifying factors via K and M respectively, affecting the trajectory that the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will follow. Thus, the final state depends on the initial control by K, the intervention by M, and the operation of L.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state u(T) depends on L, but not directly on K or M. The initial state u(t1) influenced by K and the new intervention q(x) influenced by M affect u(t1), which then evolves under L to determine u(T)."
