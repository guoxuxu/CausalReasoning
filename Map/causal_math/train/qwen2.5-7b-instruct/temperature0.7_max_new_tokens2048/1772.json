  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We assess how the behavior of the system changes if a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), with M a constant matrix, is applied at different moments.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied during the system's evolution, knowing only \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or varying their timings could lead to the same final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to the overlapping effects and non-unique decompositions associated with exponential matrices. This ambiguity prevents precise backward determination of the interventions solely from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
