  "Problem": "Consider a scenario wherein we have a Hilbert space and a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined on this space. The function \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied to any function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) in the space, and then the operator operates on \\\\( h(f(x)) \\\\). Furthermore, we consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and check how applying this transform affects the linear operation.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied as an intervention before applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\), will the final outcome depend only on the action of \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) changes the characteristics of the function, potentially affecting how the operator \\\\( L \\\\) impacts the function. Both the original squaring function \\\\( h \\\\) and the Fourier transform play significant roles in shaping the final outcome.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Fourier transform before the linear operator L means that the operator L acts on the Fourier transformed version of h(f(x)), so the final outcome depends on both L and the Fourier transform, but not directly on h(x)."
