  "Problem": "Examine the relationship in a mechanical system governed by the Laplace-transformed equation \\\\(L{\\\\ddot{x} + k\\\\dot{x} + mx} = F(s)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\), and \\\\(m\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is the Laplace transform of a force function. We investigate the effects of applying different inverse transformations representing procedural changes.\n\nGiven the final observed displacement \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what interventions (changes in \\\\(k\\\\) or \\\\(m\\\\), or both) were implemented during the evolution of the system, based solely on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The displacement \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of changes in the system constants \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(m\\\\) over time, along with differing initial conditions and force function forms. The number of variables and their possible interactions make it infeasible to uniquely backtrack the exact nature and timing of interventions only from \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of the force function F(s) directly influences the observed displacement x(T); the damping coefficient k and the mass m also directly influence the observed displacement x(T)."
