  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the displacement vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time t is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by the function \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), on the system behavior.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation defined by \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-\\\\lambda t} dt \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the behavior of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(x) \\\\) introduces an additional transformation, which affects the displacement vector's trajectory by changing its decomposition and potentially introducing damping or other effects. This makes the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent not only on M but also on the characteristics of \\\\( G(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation G(x) at time t1 will influence x(t) for T > t1, but the long-term behavior of x(T) for T > t1 will primarily depend on the matrix M due to the governing differential equation d/dt x(t) = Mx(t)."
