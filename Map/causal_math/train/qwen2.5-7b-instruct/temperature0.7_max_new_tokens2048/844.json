  "Problem": "Consider a continuous time system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(s)y(s) ds \\\\), with \\\\( K(s) \\\\) and \\\\( y(s) \\\\) representing kernel and input functions, respectively. We investigate the effect of an input transformation \\\\( y'(s) = y(s) + h(s) \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is another function, on the output over time.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely if an intervention (resetting input function to \\\\( y(s) \\\\) or maintaining \\\\( y'(s) = y(s) + h(s) \\\\)) occurred only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since different combinations and timings of intervention could yield similar or identical values of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it is impossible to deduce precisely what interventions were applied merely from the endpoint value. Both the initial presence and the potential removal of \\\\( h(s) \\\\) contribute ambiguously to the final output.",
