  "Problem": "Consider the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\\\) over a closed contour C in the complex plane, where a and w are constants, and w lies inside C. This transformation explores the impact of parameter 'a' on function behavior around singular point w.\n\nIf an intervention modifies 'a' to 'a + b' at a certain t during the computation of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), where b is a constant, will the final value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) solely depend on the new value of 'a'?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the parameter dynamically, and thus the resulting function depends not only on the new parameter 'a + b' but also on the original parameter 'a' during areas of the path contour prior to the intervention, as well as the interaction of these parameters with the pole w.",
