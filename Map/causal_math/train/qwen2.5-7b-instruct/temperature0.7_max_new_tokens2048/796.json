  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to the variable z in the complex plane over time t, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the output from \\\\( f \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether none, \\\\( g \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), or both), just by observing the result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\) could alternatively reinforce or counteract each other's effects depending on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and timings, leading to potential ambiguity about the transformations applied unless further information about phase or magnitude changes is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying either g(z), h(z), or both g(z) and h(z) to z before passing it through f(z^2) results in changes to the output that cannot be uniquely traced back to the specific transformations applied."
