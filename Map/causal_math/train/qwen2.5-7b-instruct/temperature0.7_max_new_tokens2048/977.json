  "Problem": "Assuming a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. A Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), transforming it to a new domain.\n\nIf you know the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = s_0 \\\\) and let the system evolve under the original differential equations without further intervention, will the behavior of the original system \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any given time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Laplace transform encodes complete information about \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the transformed domain under \\\\( F(s_0) \\\\) could lead to different interpretations or solutions, depending on initial conditions and the behavior of the inverse Laplace across the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform F(s) influences the representation of z(t) in the s-domain, while A governs the evolution of x(t) and B governs the evolution of y(t). Without further intervention, the behavior of z(t) at any given time t=T will be determined by the initial conditions and the matrices A and B, and thus will not change based on the value of F(s) at s=s_0."
