  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) through \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\). Given that N may introduce new dynamics or alter existing ones, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ depending on the relative properties of M and N.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) = e^(Nt)z applied to z_0 at t=0, followed by evolution under dz/dt = Mz, results in z(t) which is different from evolving z_0 directly under dz/dt = Mz from t=0 to t=T due to the additional multiplicative factor e^(Nt)."
