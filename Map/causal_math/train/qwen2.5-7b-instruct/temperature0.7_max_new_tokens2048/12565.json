  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices and x is the initial state vector. We explore how the Laplace Transform and its inverse affect the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the transformed system state at time t from an unknown initial condition, can we reconstruct the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) precisely without knowing the specific matrices A and C?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of matrices A and C, reconstructing the initial state vector x is impossible, as these matrices dictate how the initial conditions are propagated through time. The transform could represent a multitude of potential original vectors depending on A and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z is determined by the matrices A and C, the initial state vector x, and the time t through the transformation defined by the equation. A and C influence z directly, while x and t also contribute to determining z."
