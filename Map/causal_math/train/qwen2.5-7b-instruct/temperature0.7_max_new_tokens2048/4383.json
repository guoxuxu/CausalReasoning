  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a nonzero complex constant.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( j(z) = Dz \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant is applied as an intervention at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( j(z) = Dz \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) not only depends on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but is significantly influenced by \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\) through their effects on the system’s dynamics pre- and post-intervention. Both the scalar multiplicative effects and nonlinear term play roles.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The angular frequency ω directly influences the rate of change of z with respect to time, which in turn determines the value of z at any future time T. The constants C and D affect the state of z at specific times but do not influence the long-term behavior of z determined by ω alone."
