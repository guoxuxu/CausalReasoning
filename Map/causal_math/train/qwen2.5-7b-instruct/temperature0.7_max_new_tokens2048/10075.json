  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistance R in series with an inductance L and a varying voltage source V(t). The voltage and current relationship is given by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI\\\\), where I is the current through the circuit.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional resistance \\\\(R_2\\\\) is introduced into the circuit as an intervention, will the current I(T) for T > t_1 depend only on the original voltage source \\\\(V_0\\\\) and not on the introduced resistance \\\\(R_2\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional resistance \\\\(R_2\\\\) changes the total resistance in the circuit which affects the ratio of the voltage drop across the resistors to the inductor, thereby altering the rate of change of current and the final value of I(T). Thus, I(T) will depend on both \\\\(V_0\\\\) and \\\\(R_2\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage V(t) and resistance R directly cause the current I. Introducing an additional resistance R2 does not directly affect the current I for T > t1, assuming the voltage source V0 remains constant."
