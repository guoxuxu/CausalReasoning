  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) that describes a rotating vector in the complex plane, influenced by the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We examine the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) to observe the behavior over a period \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a specific \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and then allowed to evolve naturally, will the resultant function at time t = T be the same as if no transformation \\\\( T \\\\) but just natural evolution occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) results in an integral of the function over time, which modifies its behavior significantly from natural exponential growth. Instead of rotating about the origin, the transformed function accumulates values, reflecting a growth in magnitude that is distinctively different from the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency parameter ω determines the initial function z(t), which is then transformed by T into T[z](t). This transformation evolves over time to produce T[z](T), while ω also influences the final state T[z](T) at time T."
