  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance \\\\(Z(s) = sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC}\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are the inductance and capacitance, respectively. The circuit's response to a voltage input \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is modeled by the transfer function \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC}}\\\\). We examine the application of the Laplace Transform and its inverse to analyze the time domain and frequency domain behaviors.\n\nCan we determine solely by observing the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at some time t > \\\\(t_0\\\\) whether an intervention altering inductance occurred, assuming no initial knowledge about the nature of the potential intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without initial knowledge of what specific interventions could have been applied or their timings, it is complex to definitively ascertain from the output \\\\(I(t)\\\\) alone whether an alteration in inductance occurred. Both the natural response and the effect of the intervention would be convoluted in the observed output, making it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
