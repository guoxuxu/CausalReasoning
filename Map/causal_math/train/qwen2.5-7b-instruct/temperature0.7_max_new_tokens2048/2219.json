  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is considered, which affects the function over time span [0, T].\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-2s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely a function of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not dependent on the specifics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as a new modifying factor means that the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\) is influenced by both transformations. Each applies a different damping effect, complicating the contributions of the original oscillator's frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to the final outcome. The sequential or overlapping effects of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) render the final state dependent on both transformations.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z(T) depends on ω and t, with t1 influencing z(t1) and indirectly z(T) through g(z), but not directly affecting z(T) beyond its impact on z(t1). The endpoint z(T) is thus influenced by ω and the time span [0, T], with t1's effect mediated through z(t1)."
