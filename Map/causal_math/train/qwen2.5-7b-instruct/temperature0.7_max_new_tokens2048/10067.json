  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic model where the temperature of a system \\\\( T \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of an initial condition modification characterized by \\\\( T(x,0) = T_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a heat source distribution function.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an additional heat source \\\\( k(x) \\\\) is introduced, will the final temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the influence of the original heat source \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and not \\\\( k(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional heat source \\\\( k(x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the heat equation. Both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( k(x) \\\\) will influence the final temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\). The system's final state reflects the cumulative effect of both heat sources.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
