  "Problem": "Assess the effects of a Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant, and its impact on system behavior described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nIf during the system's operation, the input function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is switched at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to another function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-ct^2} \\\\) (with \\\\( c \\\\) being a different constant) through an intervention, will the final system's behavior at time \\\\( T \\\\) be independent of the original input \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by switching to function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) alters the system's input, and thus its entire subsequent behavior. The output at any time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) will be dependent on the preceding inputs \\\\( g(t) \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), exhibiting dependency on both.",
