  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation given by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\\\) where \\\\(W_t\\\\) is a standard Brownian motion, \\\\(\\mu\\\\) is the drift coefficient, and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) is the volatility coefficient. We explore the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( Z_t = e^{\\lambda t}X_t \\\\) for some constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\).\n\nGiven the process \\\\( Z_t \\\\) at some final time T, can we precisely determine the interventions applied (changes in \\\\(\\mu\\\\) or the value of \\\\(\\lambda\\\\)) solely based on the observation of \\\\( Z_T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of changes in the drift coefficient (\\\\(\\mu\\\\) to \\\\(\\mu'\\\\)) and the scaling due to \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) can yield similar or identical values of \\\\( Z_T \\\\). Thus, it's not feasible to uniquely determine the specific interventions made based solely on the final value \\\\( Z_T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "μ and σ directly influence dX_t, which in turn influences Z_t and Z_T through the transformation Z_t = e^(λt)X_t. λ also directly influences Z_t and Z_T."
