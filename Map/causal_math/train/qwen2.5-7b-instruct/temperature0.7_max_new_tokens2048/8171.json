  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation described by \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function in time. We investigate the causal relationships under the application of the Fourier Transform \\\\( F \\\\), a complex integral transformation defined for function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nWould mixing another operation, say a Laplace Transform denoted as \\\\( P \\\\), at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affect the evolution of the system considering that the Fourier Transform was already applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a Laplace Transform \\\\( P \\\\) can further modify the frequency or s-domain representation of the function, changing the overall system behavior after initial Fourier Transform application. The outcome at any subsequent time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations and their properties with respect to how they modify the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input function x(t) directly influences y(t) through the Fourier Transform, resulting in X(ω). Applying the Laplace Transform P to X(ω) leads to Y'(ω), which indirectly affects y(t) via the inverse Fourier Transform."
