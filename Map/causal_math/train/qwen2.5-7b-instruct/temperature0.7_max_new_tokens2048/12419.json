  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\) with a given constant k. The influence of an external transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constants, is considered over time t.\n\nGiven the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can one precisely deduce what interventions (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, merely by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can arise from different sequences or combinations of interventions owing to the properties of exponential functions and the superposition principle in linear systems. Therefore, without explicit information on the interventions, one cannot uniquely determine their nature or existence solely based on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
