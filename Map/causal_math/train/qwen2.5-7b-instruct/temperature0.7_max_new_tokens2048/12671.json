  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) of \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\), followed by its evolution in time is analyzed.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\), can we determine if a Fourier transform, its inverse, both, or neither were applied during the system's evolution, just by examining \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multitude of possible differential evolutions mixed with potentially overlapping effects of forward and inverse Fourier transforms, one cannot definitively conclude the historical sequence of transformations or the absence thereof solely based on the end state. For example, certain frequency domain characteristics might be preserved or canceled out, creating ambiguities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u_0 directly influences u(T,x) through the evolution governed by the PDE. Applying a Fourier transform to u_0 directly leads to u(T,x). Applying the inverse Fourier transform to u(T,x) directly results in a state that can be related back to u_0."
