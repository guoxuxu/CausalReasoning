  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We study the implications of modifying this integral using a linear transformation of the variable x given by the function \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nHaving computed \\\\( F(ax + b) \\\\) at x = T, can we determine the original x value at T, assuming no additional information about a or b?",
  "Explanation": "Without the constants a and b from the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine the original x that yields a particular transformed value \\\\( ax + b \\\\). Multiple x values could correspond to the same transformed result due to different potential values of a and b.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
