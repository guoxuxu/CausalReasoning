  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation under the action of a linear operator defined by \\\\( L[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw \\), where the operation is along a path in the complex plane.\n\nAfter observing the result of \\\\( L[g](z) \\\\) from the intervention, can we determine the specific nature of the intervention (i.e., the value of c) knowing that the original function was \\\\( z^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral result and knowing the original form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we can back-calculate to find the coefficient c. The modification by a scalar multiplication in the complex plane is traceable since it scales the entire function in a predictable way, thus allowing the specific intervention to be identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original function z^2 → g, which is then transformed by the linear operator L to produce L[g], resulting in a specific outcome that may help determine the nature of the intervention."
