  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces out a unit circle in the complex plane over time. Analyze the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) follows \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) initially without transformations from 0 to T, will the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) applied at time T yield the same result as directly calculating \\\\( T(z) \\\\) from 0 to T without altering the function?",
  "Explanation": "Since no modification is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the integral transformation will directly compute the area under the curve of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which effectively traces the integral of a circular motion, generating the same result irrespective of any structural changes since none occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation T(z) accumulates the values of z(t) from 0 to T, so applying T(z) at time T yields the same result as directly calculating T(z) from 0 to T without altering the function."
