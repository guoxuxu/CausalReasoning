  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on a region in the complex plane under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^t dt \\\\). Analyze the impact of this function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed for \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) along a straight path from 0 to \\\\\\\\((( z \\\\\\\\)), will the integral value at \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) be solely dependent on the end-point \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) and not on the path taken?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\\\\\(( e^t \\\\\\\\)) is holomorphic over the entire complex plane, and by Cauchy's integral theorem, the integral of \\\\\\\\(( e^t \\\\\\\\)) between two points along any path that does not enclose any singularities (of which there are none) will only depend on the endpoints. Therefore, any straight or curved path from 0 to \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) will yield the same result in the absence of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The integral value at z (F(z)) is solely dependent on the end-point z and not on the path taken. The path taken affects the computation of F(z), but once the end-point z is determined, the integral value is fixed."
