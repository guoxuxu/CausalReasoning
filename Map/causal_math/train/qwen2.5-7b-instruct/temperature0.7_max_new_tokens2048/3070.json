  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We explore the impact of a boundary condition modification \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\), a given function, and how it affects the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) across the domain.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) for all (x, y) in the domain, can we uniquely determine the boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) without prior knowledge of this boundary being applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace equation is linear, the dependence of the solution on boundary conditions is direct and reversible. Knowing the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) throughout the domain allows the extrapolation back to the boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The boundary condition φ(x,0) = h(x) directly influences the solution φ(x,y) throughout the domain; knowing φ(x,y) does not allow us to uniquely determine the specific form of φ(x,0) = h(x) without prior knowledge."
