  "Problem": "Investigate a situation where the effectiveness of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied to a signal analyzed using the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides a method to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain representation.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied to a time-domain signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then analyzed using Fourier Transform without further intervention, will the frequency spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be solely determined by \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modifies the time-domain signal by introducing a frequency shift. This shift changes the frequency composition of the signal, resulting in a frequency spectrum that is not solely determined by the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\), but by the combination of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the effects of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time-domain signal x(t) is transformed into the frequency-domain representation F(ω) through the Fourier Transform. Applying the complex function z(t) to x(t) at t=0 modifies x(t), which then influences F(ω)."
