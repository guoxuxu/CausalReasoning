  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real number and represents angular frequency. The function is initially subjected to the linear operator \\\\( L \\{ z(t) \\} = \\\\int_{0}^{∞} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), which represents the Laplace transform.\n\nCan the original function parameters, particularly \\\\( ω \\\\) and any applied initial phase shift (if any), be accurately inferred knowing only the Laplace transform result after an unknown intervention has modified the function?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the nature of the intervention (particularly the new frequency \\\\( ω' \\\\) and phase shift \\\\( φ \\\\)), the original parameters including \\\\( ω \\\\) and any possible phase shifts cannot be unequivocally determined solely from the transform result, demonstrating ambiguity in causal inference post intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
