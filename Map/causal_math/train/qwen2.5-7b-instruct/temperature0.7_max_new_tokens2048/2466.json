  "Problem": "Consider a periodic signal described by the function \\\\( v(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi) \\\\). The signal undergoes various modifications using a linear operator represented by \\\\( L \\\\) that performs a convolution with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specifically designed to alter phase and amplitude.\n\nObserving the transformed signal \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine precisely the original phase \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and amplitude \\\\( A \\\\) of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) without knowing the kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), reverse-engineering to \\\\( v(t) \\\\)'s original parameters such as phase and amplitude is impractical. Different kernels could yield similar transformations rendering the original signal parameters indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original signal v(t) is influenced by its amplitude A, angular frequency ω, and phase φ. The transformation through the linear operator L with kernel h(t) results in the modified signal w(t). Knowing w(t) and h(t) allows inference about v(t), but determining A and φ precisely without h(t) is not possible."
