  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes analysis under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{mt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the original transformation parameter \\\\( k \\\\), the intervention parameter \\\\( m \\\\), and the system's inherent parameter \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). The transformations interact through compounded exponential scaling and phase shifting, distinctly impacting the system's state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time T depends on ω through the differential equation, and is influenced by k and m through the transformations f(z) and g(z), but the endpoint z(T) for T > t1 will reflect the cumulative effect of ω, k, and m."
