  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) being a function evolving under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. Consider the role of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and how it interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initialized using \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\), and then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) without further intervention, does the Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) remain unaffected irrespective of \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform, \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), depends on all frequencies of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and is particularly sensitive to the initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The system's behavior under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) influences \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and consequently the properties of \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any given \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
