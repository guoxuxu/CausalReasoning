  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a constant complex number. We examine the outcome of the transformation specified by the function \\\\(h(z) = e^{Et}z\\\\), with E being another constant complex number, over time t.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 be accurately derived after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information about the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), it's not possible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\(z_0\\\\) because the transformation \\\\(e^{Et}\\\\) might have changed initial conditions in a way that is not reversible, especially if E does not conveniently align in phase or magnitude with D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of z at time t depends on the initial value of z, the time elapsed, and the constant D. The function h transforms z if E is non-zero. Knowing z(T) allows inferring z(0) if h was applied."
