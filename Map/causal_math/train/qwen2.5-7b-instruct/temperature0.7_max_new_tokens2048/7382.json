  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions, expressed as \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a potential function. An external spatial transformation is defined by \\\\(h(x, y) = (e^{ax}, e^{by})\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(u(h(x, y))\\\\) that satisfies the Laplace equation at time \\\\(t=T\\\\), can we infer that the original function \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at \\\\(t=0\\\\) also satisfied it?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing that \\\\(u(h(x, y))\\\\) satisfies the Laplace equation post-transformation does not necessarily imply that the original function \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) did. The transformation could harmonize otherwise non-harmonic components, or the specifics of the constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) might facilitate a unique scenario where the transformed function coincidentally satisfies the equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(x, y) maps the original function u(x, y) to u(h(x, y)), and if u(h(x, y)) satisfies the Laplace equation, then u(x, y) must have satisfied it before the transformation."
