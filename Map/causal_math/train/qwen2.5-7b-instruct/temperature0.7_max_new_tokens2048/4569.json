  "Problem": "Consider the linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. Assess the effects of transforming the system with the operator \\\\( T(x) = Mx + N \\\\), where M and N are matrices and N is not necessarily zero.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Mx_0 + N \\\\), impacting the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( N \\\\) adds a constant shift, the path and final state of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time T will differ unless \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are specially configured relative to D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the transformation T to the initial state x_0 at t=0 changes the initial state, which then evolves differently under the dynamics described by D compared to evolving x_0 directly under D."
