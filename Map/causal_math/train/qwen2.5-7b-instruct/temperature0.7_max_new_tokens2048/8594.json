  "Problem": "Consider the impact of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) and how it behaves when inverse transformed under different modifications.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine that the original time-domain function was \\\\( te^{2t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming standard conditions (e.g., no non-standard modifications in transform rules), the specific transform result \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-2)^2} \\\\) uniquely corresponds to \\\\( te^{2t} \\\\), allowing us to infer the original function correctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
