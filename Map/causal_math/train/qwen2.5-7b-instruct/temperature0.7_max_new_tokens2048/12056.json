  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process characterized by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+ib)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real constants representing decay/growth rates and oscillatory behavior respectively. We explore the consequence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on the process.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time from t = 0 to t = T without any transformation, and then the integration \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied, does the result \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) solely depend on the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation result \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) is a direct calculation based on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and does not depend on any factor other than the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) described in the function. Since no external interventions or transformations are applied before integration, the result directly reflects the impact of these parameters.",
