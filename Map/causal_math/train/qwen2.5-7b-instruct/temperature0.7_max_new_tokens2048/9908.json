  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the frequency domain, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then transformed by the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), taking place over a duration T.\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) after an intervention, is it possible to specify exactly what the intervention (phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) or other) was?",
  "Explanation": "The output, while potentially influenced by the intervention, does not carry enough information to uniquely identify the nature or magnitude of the intervention due to the infinite possibilities of phase shifts or other modifications that could result in the same integral output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The signal z(t) is transformed by T[] into T[z], and a phase shift on z(t) influences the resulting T[z], which in turn provides information about the intervention."
