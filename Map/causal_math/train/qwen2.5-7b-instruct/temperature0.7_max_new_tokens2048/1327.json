  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nIf at a specific point z after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), an intervention is applied by then squaring the result (\\\\( g(f(z)) = (e^{iz})^2 \\\\)), will the final outcome depend on the order of these transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f \\\\) followed by \\\\( g \\\\) as an intervention results in \\\\( (e^{iz})^2 \\\\), which is different from \\\\( e^{i(z^2)} \\\\) (outcome of g then f). The exponential function composition with squaring leads to distinctly different results due to non-commutativity of these operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex variable z is transformed by f(z) = e^(iz), then this result is squared by g(f(z)) = (e^(iz))^2, influencing the final outcome. The order of transformations matters as squaring the result of f(z) is different from applying f to the square of z."
