  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a time-dependent input vector and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of introducing a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) over time t, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf after a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied as an intervention and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is computed to t = T for T > t_1, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still reflect the initial matrix A irrespective of the intervention with B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\), that is \\\\( e^{Bt}x \\\\), affects the input from t_1 to T, changing how the integration accumulates contributions of the modified input vector towards \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the influences of both A and B post-intervention, making it dependent on the specifics of both matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(x) caused by B affects the input x, which in turn influences z(T) through the integral function, but the initial matrix A directly determines z(T) independently of the intervention by B."
