  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iDt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, represents a transformation applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the influences of the respective phase shifts from \\\\( e^{iDt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iEt} \\\\) transformations, similar end states \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can arise from multiple sequences or types of interventions. The end state's overlaying of effects from potentially commutative transformations within the set of differential equations leaves room for ambiguity in identifying specific interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of C determines the rate of change of z with respect to time, D transforms z through the function g, and T specifies when the state z(T) is observed."
