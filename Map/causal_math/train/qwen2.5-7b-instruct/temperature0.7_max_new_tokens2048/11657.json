  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit system where the voltage across a capacitor (V) is related to the charge (Q) by the relation \\\\( V = \\\\frac{Q}{C} \\\\) where C is the capacitance. Additionally, a sinusoidal input voltage is transformed by a Laplace transformation, resulting in a transformed output that is affected by the system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the system starts with a certain charge Q0 and the Laplace transform of a sinusoidal input is applied without further manual alteration of C, will the output voltage V(t) at t = T be the same as if Q0 has been directly allowed to influence V(t) under \\\\( V = \\\\frac{Q}{C} \\\\) without the sinusoidal input?",
  "Explanation": "The sinusoidal input, once transformed and applied to the system, changes the way charge is distributed across the circuit, thereby altering the voltage V(t) from what would be determined solely by Q0 and C in a static scenario. The system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifies these dynamics further.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial charge Q0 directly influences the voltage V through the relationship V = Q/C. The Laplace transform of a sinusoidal input influences the output voltage V(t) via the system's response function H(s), transforming V(s) into V(t). Without further manual alteration of C, the output voltage V(t) at t = T due to Q0 and the sinusoidal input will differ from the voltage V(t) solely due to Q0."
