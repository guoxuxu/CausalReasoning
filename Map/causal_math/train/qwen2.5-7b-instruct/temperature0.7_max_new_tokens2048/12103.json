  "Problem": "Investigate a complex dynamical system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by the input \\( x(t) \\) according to a Laplace transform relationship \\( Z(s) = X(s)/s \\). Here, \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Z(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( z(t) \\) respectively, with \\( s \\) being a complex variable.\n\nGiven an observation \\( z(T) \\) at time T, can it be determined if an intervention occurred or the nature of the intervention based solely on \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of Laplace transforms and the possible overlapping effects of varied input modifications, identifying specific interventions or determining their exact nature from \\( z(T) \\) only is not feasible without additional contextual information about the changes to \\( x(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input x(t) directly influences the output z(t) through their Laplace transforms X(s) and Z(s) respectively, with z(t) being effectively a delayed version of x(t) due to the division by s."
