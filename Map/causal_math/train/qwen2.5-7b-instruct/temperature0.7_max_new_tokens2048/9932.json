  "Problem": "Consider the equation governing the heat conduction in a rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the spatial variable. Assume the rod is initially at rest with a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) and that k is a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution at some endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we exactly determine which interventions (if any) took place and what the original temperature distribution was, solely based on the observed endpoint data?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions or reconstructing the exact initial conditions from final state data alone is highly challenging without additional information about the possible interventions or initial conditions. Multiple combinations of interventions and initial conditions could lead to the same observed final state, especially considering the diffusion's smoothing effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
