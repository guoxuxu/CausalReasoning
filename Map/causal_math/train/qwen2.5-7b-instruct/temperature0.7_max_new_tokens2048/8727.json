  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) on a vector \\\\( v \\\\) in a vector space, where A is a constant matrix. Assessing the role of an additive perturbation \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) applied to this transformation, where \\\\( w \\\\) is another constant vector.\n\nIf we apply an intervention \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the dynamics governed by \\\\( B \\\\) and not on the initial transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds the vector \\\\( w \\\\) to whatever state the system is in at \\\\( t_1 \\\\. This change alters the trajectory that the system would have followed under \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) alone, hence the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the linear transformation \\\\( A \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( w \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
