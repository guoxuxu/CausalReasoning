  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) models the energy states in a two-dimensional space depending on positions x and y. We explore the effect of a rotational transformation defined by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) applied to a vector \\\\( v = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( v \\\\) be uniquely determined from the energy state \\\\( z \\\\) without knowing whether a rotation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the energy state \\\\( z \\\\), multiple vectors differing by rotational transformations could yield the same energy state due to the rotational symmetry of the function \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\). Without knowing the angle of rotation, the original vector cannot be deduced uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
