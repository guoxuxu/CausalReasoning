  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{N\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), match the function if \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the pathway of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating a factor influenced by N, thus modifying the trajectory from its original path governed solely by M. The integration and matrix exponentials contribute differently to the function's evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) under the differential equation dz/dt = Mz is independent of the integral transformation T(z) = ∫_0^t e^(Nτ) z(τ) dτ, meaning applying T(z) and then allowing z(t) to evolve according to Mz will result in the same function z(T) as if T(z) was never applied."
