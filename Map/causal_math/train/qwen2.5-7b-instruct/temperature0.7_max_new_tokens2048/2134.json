  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = F(x, y) \\\\) that maps complex numbers \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) to \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( F(x, y) = x^2 + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( F \\\\) and its derivatives across transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(x, y) = (e^{Ax}x, e^{By}y) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we deduce the precise original inputs \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\) if no additional information about the use of transformations \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific transformations applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( y_0 \\\\) through \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\), and given the non-invertibility and non-linear nature of \\\\( F \\\\) when combined with exponential transformations, it is not possible to uniquely identify the original inputs from the resultant \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function F(x, y) maps inputs x and y to z, while the transformation function f(x, y) modifies x and y to produce new inputs for F, resulting in z(t). Without additional information about the specific values of A and B or the exact transformation applied, it is not possible to precisely determine the original inputs x_0 and y_0 from the transformed output z(t)."
