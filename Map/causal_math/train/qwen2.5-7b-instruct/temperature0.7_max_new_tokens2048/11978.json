  "Problem": "Consider a function space influenced by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and consider the integral transform \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} K(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transform. The challenge is to assess how transformations and inverses of these operators affect the functions within this space.\n\nSuppose an additional operation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function space after transformation \\\\( T \\\\), which modifies each function. Will the end results be independent of the original operator \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a new operation \\\\( M \\\\) following the transformation by \\\\( T \\\\) will still reflect the original modifications by \\\\( L \\\\). Since these operators can significantly vary how they transform their subject functions, the final outcome will be contingent on both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator L influences the function space, which is transformed by T to produce TransformedFunction; applying M to TransformedFunction results in ModifiedFunction, with the end result potentially dependent on L through its effect on the initial function space."
