  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is a solution, then we apply a transformation by adding a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) where \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) and examine changes in the boundary behavior.\n\nIf a correction function \\\\(h(z, t) = e^{kt}g(z)\\\\), which depends on time t and a constant k, is applied to the system at time t = 1, will the boundary behavior of \\\\(u\\\\) at a later time t = T exclusively depend on k?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of \\\\(h(z, t)\\\\) on \\\\(u\\\\) is not confined to the scaling factor k but also on how the function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) and its interaction with \\\\(u\\\\) evolve over time. The new boundary behavior at t = T depends on both the nature of \\\\(g\\\\) and the parameter k.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
