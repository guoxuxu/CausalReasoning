  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is studied under different transformations. Here, C and D are matrices, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the outcome when transformations \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) are applied, where F and G are also constant matrices.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and this state is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) without further intervention, does the presence of transformation \\\\( h \\\\) result in the same final state at t=T as just evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{F0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and evolving under different dynamics, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will be affected by F initially, resulting in a potentially different state at time T than by just using D on \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformation h(z) = e^(Ft)z to z_0 at t=0 and allowing it to evolve under z(t) = Ce^(Dt) for time T results in the same final state z(T) as directly evolving z_0 under z(t) = Ce^(Dt) for time T, assuming F and G are such that the overall transformation is equivalent."
