  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature (T) at any spatial point (x,y) in a region follows the heat equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We study the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the temperature distribution, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), and analyze its influence over time.\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(T)\\\\), or both) just by observing the final state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)(T)\\\\) may result from several combinations of interventions and initial conditions. Distinguishing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), only to be later modified by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(T)\\\\), or some other sequence, is ambiguous without additional information due to overlapping effects in the transformed domain.",
