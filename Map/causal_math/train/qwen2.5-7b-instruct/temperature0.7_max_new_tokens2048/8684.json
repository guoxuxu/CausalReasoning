  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nCan the specific functions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) used be uniquely determined based solely on observing the altered spectrum of \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions such as \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) merely through the final spectrum is highly challenging due to potential overlaps in the spectral effects caused by different functional forms of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\). Multiple combinations of these functions could result in similar spectral modifications, thus specific identification is not feasible without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of a Gaussian function g(x) and another function h(x) to the signal f(x) can both result in changes to its spectrum, implying that observing the altered spectrum alone does not uniquely determine either g(x) or h(x)."
