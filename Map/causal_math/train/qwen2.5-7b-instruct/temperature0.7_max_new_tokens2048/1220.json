  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) where f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact of a complex function transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and its corresponding transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform result \\\\( H(s) \\\\) after intervention, can we determine exactly whether the original function was transformed to \\\\( t^2 f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) = e^{-t} f(t) \\\\) based only on the knowledge of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone doesn’t provide sufficient information to clearly distinguish between the original transformation being \\\\( t^2 f(t) \\\\) and the intervention transformation \\\\( e^{-t} f(t) \\\\). This lack of clear distinction arises due to the integrative effect of the Laplace transform concealing specific details of the applied transformations in the time domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The transform of g(t) (which is t^2 * f(t)) and the transform of h(t) (which is e^(-t) * f(t)) both influence H(s), but knowing H(s) alone does not allow us to determine exactly which original function was transformed."
