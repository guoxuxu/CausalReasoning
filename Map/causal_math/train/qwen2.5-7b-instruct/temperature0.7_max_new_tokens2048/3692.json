  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\xi t} dt\\\\).\n\nKnowing only the Fourier transformed output, can we determine whether an intervention (specifically a phase shift) was applied to the original \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a phase-shifted signal results in a modification of phase in its spectral component but retains the frequency location. Without additional phase information, one cannot distinguish whether a phase shift was applied or not, as the primary frequency component remains unchanged.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
