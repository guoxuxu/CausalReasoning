  "Problem": "A physical system is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix with distinct eigenvalues. The impact of an external control described by \\\\( h(x) = S x \\\\) on the state x at different time intervals is analyzed, where S is a constant matrix serving as a shift transformation.\n\nIf an initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Sx \\\\) at time t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without any further interference, will the resulting state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to the state if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = Sx \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by shifting the vector according to matrix S. Since S can change the system's trajectory, the final vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will generally differ from what would be obtained if only \\\\( D \\\\) acted on \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from the outset.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state x_0, after being transformed by h(x) = Sx at t=0, influences x(t) at any later time t=T through the dynamics defined by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\). Direct evolution of x_0 under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) from t=0 to t=T would result in a different x(t) unless S is the identity matrix."
