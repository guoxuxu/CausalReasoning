  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = (K * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is a kernel representing a transformation and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(t) = e^{At}K(t) \\\\) where A is a constant.\n\nIf the kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( K'(t) = e^{At}K(t) \\\\) at the beginning and the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is applied, will the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as it would be under the original kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the kernel changes how the input signal is processed. The factor \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) can significantly alter the characteristics of the kernel, affecting the final output. Such a transformation might amplify, dampen, or alter the phase of components of the input signal resulting in a different output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying the kernel to K'(t) = e^(At)K(t) changes the output z(t) at time T compared to using the original kernel K(t). The constant A affects the kernel, which in turn affects the output z(t), and the input signal x(t) also directly influences z(t)."
