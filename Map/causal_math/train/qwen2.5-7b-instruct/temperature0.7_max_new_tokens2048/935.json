  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Pz \\\\), where P is a linear operator. Investigate the effects of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Qz \\\\) where Q is a transformation matrix applied at various time epochs.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( k(z) = Rz \\\\) where R is another matrix, is applied at time t = U (U < S) as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(S) \\\\) exclusively depend on P ignoring the effects of Q and R?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(S) \\\\) will depend on the initial action of Q and the intervention by R, in addition to the underlying dynamics dictated by P. The transformation matrices Q and R alter the state before and after their application, respectively, thereby changing the evolution pathway and the final state at S.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
