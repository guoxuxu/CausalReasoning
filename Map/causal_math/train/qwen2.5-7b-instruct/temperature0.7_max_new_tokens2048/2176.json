  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + c\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the stability and transformation of the function under an integral transformation, defined as \\\\( T_h[f](z) = \\\\int_0^1 e^{ht} f(tz) dt \\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a real constant parameter.\n\nCan we determine exactly which parameters (\\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\)) were used in transformations \\\\( T_h \\\\) and \\\\( S_k \\\\), based solely on observing the output of \\\\( S_k[f](z) \\\\) for some \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific values of \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) that were used in the transformations impact the function in a manner generating similar outcomes from different parameter settings, particularly due to the non-linear and aggregated nature of these transformations. Various combinations of \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) could yield similar results, making exact identification of parameters unfeasible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of h influences the transformation T_h[f](z); the constant c determines the form of the function f(z); the value of h also influences the transformation S_k[f](z)."
