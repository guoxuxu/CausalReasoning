  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We introduce a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. This scenario examines the impact of this transformation on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely deduce which transformations were applied (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) just by knowing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping integral transformations and the non-exclusive influence of matrix exponentials on the trajectories, multiple transformation scenarios can lead to the same state at time T, making it challenging to uniquely identify the interventions used.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The constant frequency ω influences the state z(t) through the equation z(t) = e^(iωt). The constant matrix A influences the transformation f(z) via the integral equation f(z) = ∫_0^t e^(sA)z(s) ds. The time t affects both z(t) and f(z). The time T determines the state z(T)."
