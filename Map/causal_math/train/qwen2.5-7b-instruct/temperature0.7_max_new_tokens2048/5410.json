  "Problem": "Consider a vector field represented by the function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) affects the field over time z, where B is a constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), because the transformation \\\\( e^{Bz} \\\\) could alter the original vector in a non-trivial way that isn’t reversibly traceable just by observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
