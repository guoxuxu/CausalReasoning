  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number. Further, an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied, which maps the function into the Laplace transform space.\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) only by knowing the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) if no information about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Without the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it's impossible to correctly invert the Laplace transform and uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is essential as it deeply influences the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
