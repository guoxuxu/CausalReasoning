  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nCan we deduce the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T knowing that the intervention might have been applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( e^{iBt}z \\\\) was applied, the phase and magnitude change introduced by B at t = 0 cannot be uniquely reversed especially since the effects of A and B cannot be disentangled based on just the final observation at t = T.",

The intervention h(z) directly causes the value of z(t), and the scalar B directly influences the intervention h(z). Time t directly causes the value of z(t)."
