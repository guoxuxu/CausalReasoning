  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\(u(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u\\\\) and investigate its implications over variable \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(F(u(z))\\\\), can we infer the specific form of the original function \\\\(u(z)\\\\) without knowing whether any preliminary transformations like \\\\(v(z) = e^{Bz}u(z)\\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge about preliminary transformations, reversing the Fourier transform will not necessarily retrieve the original \\\\(u(z)\\\\). Transformations such as \\\\(e^{Bz}\\\\) can significantly alter the spectral characteristics of \\\\(u(z)\\\\), affecting the invertibility and specificity of the original function recovery.",
