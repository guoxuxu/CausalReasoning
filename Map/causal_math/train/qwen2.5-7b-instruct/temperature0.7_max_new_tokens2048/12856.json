  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Fourier transform on the system governed by the partial differential equation describing heat conduction \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. The Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) with respect to space is defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x,t=0) \\\\) is transformed by the Fourier transform to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t=0) \\\\) and then evolved over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\kappa k^2 \\\\hat{u}\\\\), will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) reflect the correct temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) after an inverse Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The propagation of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) via the transformed differential equation appropriately models the behavior of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) under heat conduction, and transforming it back correctly reflects the temperature distribution at any given time T.",
