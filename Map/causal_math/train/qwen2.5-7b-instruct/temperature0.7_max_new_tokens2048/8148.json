  "Problem": "Consider a linear system subject to the equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where D is a constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of applying the transformation \\( T(x) = Lx \\) where \\( L \\) is a linear map represented by a constant matrix, and examining the behavior over a duration \\( t \\).\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were applied (either \\( T(x) \\), \\( U(x) \\), or both) solely by the observed state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( x(T) \\) could result from various combinations of applying \\( L \\), \\( M \\), or neither, depending on how these transformations interact with \\( D \\). The overlap in potential trajectories and the effects of combining \\( L \\) and \\( M \\) create ambiguity and prevent precise identification of which interventions were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
