  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time given by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system is subject to a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some future time t = T match the evolution under the original equation without applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state, thus altering the trajectory. Since \\\\( T(z) \\\\) scales the amplitude and potentially shifts the phase depending on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T will differ from simply evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the differential characteristic imposed by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z with respect to time (dz/dt) is directly caused by iωz. Applying the transformation T(z) results in z(t), which is directly caused by λt and the initial condition z_0. The application of T(z) changes the form of z(t) but does not alter the underlying dynamics described by iωz."
