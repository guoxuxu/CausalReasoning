  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study how an integral transformation by the operator \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}v dt \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, affects the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using a new operator \\\\( S(w) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}w dt \\\\) (where N is a different constant matrix) is applied, will the ultimate function \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The use of the intervention \\\\( S(w) \\\\) introduces an additional transforming effect, making the final function \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on the matrix M and N, not just the operator L. This is due to the overlapping influences of the transformations and the specific characteristics of the matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x,t) is influenced by the operators T and S through integration transformations, and also directly by the operator L. The application of S with matrix N does not affect the dependence of u(x,t) on L after the initial transformation by T with matrix M."
