  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function z(t) measures the temperature at a point in space, evolving according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We consider the impact of a time-varying boundary condition applied as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) where B is a constant scalar.\n\nIf the initial condition z(0) at t = 0 is modified by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution z(T) at time T be the same as if \\\\(z(0)\\\\) were evolved directly by the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) alters the initial condition which affects how the equation propagates the temperature through space and time. Modifying \\\\(z(0)\\\\) by multiplying with \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) changes the initial state, hence the evolved state z(T) under the heat equation will also be different, due to the modification in the distribution by the factor \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) initially.",
