  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Fourier Transform applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, which is then subjected to operations described by a differential equation \\\\( L[g(x)] = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dx^2} - k^2g \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) from its Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) after solving the differential equation in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) in its solved form from the differential equation, the Inverse Fourier Transform can be applied to retrieve \\\\( g(x) \\\\). The solution in the frequency domain can be uniquely transformed back to the time or spatial domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier Transform of g(x) leads to hat{g}(k), which is then transformed by the differential equation to produce transformed_g(k). Solving this transformed equation yields the solution_of_differential_equation, which corresponds to the original function g(x)."
