  "Problem": "Let's examine a thermal system where temperature \\( T \\) at any point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\), with \\( k \\) as the thermal diffusivity constant. We study the impact of a sudden temperature change applied using a function \\( f(T) = T + h \\), where \\( h \\) is a constant heat increment.\n\nIf at a given time \\( t_1 \\), a new intervention function \\( g(T) = T - c \\) (where \\( c \\) is a constant cooling decrement) is applied, will the endpoint \\( T(x,T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be dependent only on \\( k \\) and not \\( h \\) or \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both interventions (heating and cooling) affect the thermal profile. The endpoint \\( T(x,T) \\) results from the compounded effect of both the initial heat increment and the subsequent cooling, each altering the diffusion process distinctively, hence \\( T(x,T) \\) depends on \\( h \\), \\( c \\), and \\( k \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature T at a point x and time t is influenced by the thermal diffusivity constant k through the heat equation. The function f(T) = T + h increases T, while g(T) = T - c decreases T. The endpoint T(x,T) for T > t1 depends on k, h, and c."
