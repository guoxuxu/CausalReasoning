  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The function evaluates the transformation of complex functions in the complex plane and further examines how transformations such as Fourier Transform affects the signal.\n\nKnowing \\\\( G(w) \\\\), the Fourier Transform of the altered function after intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we precisely determine both the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise nature of both the original function and the intervention from \\\\( G(w) \\\\) alone is challenging. Multiple pairs of function and interventions can yield the same transformed result due to the complexity introduced by squaring and other non-linear transformations.",
