  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions describing a signal. The signal undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nWould applying a differentiation operation on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before performing \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) yield the same result as performing \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) first and then multiplying by \\\\(-i\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the properties of the Fourier Transform, differentiating a signal in the time domain corresponds to multiplying its transform by \\\\(-i\\\\omega\\\\) in the frequency domain. Therefore, the order of these operations does not alter the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Differentiating z(t) results in z'(t) which, after Fourier transform, corresponds to Z'(ω), while Fourier transforming z(t) first and then multiplying by -iω also results in Z'(ω), showing that both operations yield the same result."
