  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex vector. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) applied at different points in time and its implications under the dynamics governed by matrix \\\\( A \\\\).\n\nIf transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition by applying \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), which changes the overall trajectory of the function. This initial transformation modifies how the vector evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\), resulting in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) compared to the unmodified path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector z_0 directly influences z(t), the matrix A directly influences z(t), the transformation h(z) directly influences z(t), and time t directly influences z(t). Applying h(z) at t=0 and then evolving under A is equivalent to directly evolving z_0 under A from t=0 to T."
