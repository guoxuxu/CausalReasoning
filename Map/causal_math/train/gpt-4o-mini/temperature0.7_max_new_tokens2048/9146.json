  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is a given kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is the input function. Analyze the behavior when applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is another function.\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the input was originally \\\\( x(s) \\\\) or \\\\( g(x(s)) \\\\), without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) was applied, the observed output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to distinctly infer whether the original input was \\\\( x(s) \\\\) or altered via \\\\( g(x(s)) \\\\). Both inputs could potentially yield the same observed outcome depending on the form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\).",
