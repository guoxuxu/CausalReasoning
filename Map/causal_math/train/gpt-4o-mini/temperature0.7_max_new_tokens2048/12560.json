  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a complex potential field given by \\\\( V(z) = z^2 + iz \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number describing the position of the particle on the complex plane. We investigate the trajectories using the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to the complex position \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the movement is analyzed under the potential \\\\( V(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory of the particle be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly used to analyze movement under \\\\( V(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which affects the evolution of the trajectory under the complex potential \\\\( V(z) \\\\). The addition of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) introduces a rotating complex term that alters how the particle moves through the potential landscape.",
