  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are harmonic functions. The transformation considered here is the complex exponential transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\).\n\nIf the complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a point \\\\(z_0\\\\) and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\) changes the initial value of the system by applying the exponential map, which affects the trajectory under the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\). Thus, the state at any time T will differ from the case where the initial state was not transformed.",
