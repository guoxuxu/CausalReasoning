  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. This function describes a circle in the complex plane over time. We investigate the impacts of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, at different times.\n\nBy observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint, can we determine precisely what interventions (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, if we only know the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations applied at different times or possibly none at all. The multiplication by exponential terms with complex exponents makes it particularly challenging to disentangle and uniquely identify which transformations were applied when or if they were applied, due to the overlapping effects on the magnitude and phase.",
