  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nObserving a vector \\\\( v(t) \\\\) in the transformed basis, can we uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) if we only know the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) but not whether it was used?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( P^{-1}v \\\\) was used, the relationship between \\\\( v_0 \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) can only be hypothesized, not definitely established. Multiple vectors could potentially produce the observed \\\\( v(t) \\\\) in different bases.",
