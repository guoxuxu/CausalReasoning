  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system governed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of a holomorphic transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is considered over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to an initial complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega T} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) results in \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), changing the trajectory of evolution. The new initial condition will affect the resultant state at any time T due to the squared amplification effect, distinct from merely evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to T under the original system.",
