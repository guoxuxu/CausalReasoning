  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) evolves according to the linear time-invariant system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) an input vector. We are interested in examining the effects of implementing an input transformation \\\\(u(t) = D v(t)\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represents a new transformed input.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(D v(t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the input transformation, it is impossible to uniquely reverse-engineer \\\\(u(t)\\\\) from \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at T. The transformation by D could have altered the input in a non-identifiable way, especially if B and D are not easily invertible or distinguishable in their effects.",
