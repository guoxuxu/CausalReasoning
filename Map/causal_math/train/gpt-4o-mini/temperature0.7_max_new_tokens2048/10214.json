  "Problem": "Consider a boundary value problem for the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a bounded region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) with boundary conditions specified by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\). We investigate the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary data \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then solving the modified problem.\n\nCan we recover the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) exactly from the solution \\\\( u \\\\) inside \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) after the boundary data has been transformed by the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( u \\\\) inside \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) after applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) contains modified boundary characteristics that are not easily invertible back to the original \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without additional information or assumptions about the nature of the transformation.",
