  "Problem": "In a statistical framework, consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = X\\\\beta + \\\\epsilon \\\\), where \\\\( X \\\\) represents predictor variables matrix, \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) a coefficients vector, and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) the error terms. We are examining the effect of a simultaneous linear transformation applied to both \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) through matrix \\\\( T \\\\) which affects the causality from predictors to response.\n\nGiven the transformed data \\\\( (X', z) \\\\) without the explicit knowledge of \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\), can we infer the original predictors \\\\( X \\\\) and coefficients \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) uniquely?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\), it is not feasible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) from \\\\( X' \\\\). Transformation matrix \\\\( T \\\\) can have non-trivial null spaces or may not be invertible, leading to information loss about the original variables and coefficients.",
