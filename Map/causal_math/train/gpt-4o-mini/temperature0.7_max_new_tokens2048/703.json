  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where input signals are transformed via a complex function \\\\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z-1} \\\\\\) and then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\\\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}u(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\\\( a > 0 \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( u(t) \\\\\\) being the unit step function. The transformation due to \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) occurs in the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf we intervene by modifying the impulse response to \\\\\\( g'(t) = e^{-bt}u(t) \\\\\\) (where \\\\\\( b \\\\\\) is a different constant than \\\\\\( a \\\\\\)) at time \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\), will the output at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) solely reflect changes due to the original \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing the impulse response modifies the system dynamics itself, hence the output at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) will integrate effects from both the original transformation \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) and the new characteristic defined by \\\\\\( g'(t) \\\\\\). These changes impact the resultant signal in a compositional manner.",
