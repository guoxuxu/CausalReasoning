  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a dynamic process in the complex plane. The function is initially transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. Then, the system evolves according to the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Bz \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we invert the process to correctly identify \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could correspond to several different initial conditions, depending on whether and how \\\\( A \\\\) has modified \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The presence of matrix exponentials complicates the trace back to the original condition due to non-uniqueness unless additional information about A or the pathway involved is known.",
