  "Problem": "In a complex function framework, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant, and the implications of further transformations.\n\nGiven an observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of transformation \\\\( A \\\\), the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could originate from various initial conditions due to the scaling and phase altering properties of \\\\( A \\\\). Consequently, the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is uncertain without knowing whether \\\\( A \\\\) was involved.",
