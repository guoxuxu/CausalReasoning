  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and this function is applied in a complex analysis setting. We explore the role of a contour integral transformation of this function over a closed path in the complex plane.\n\nIf midway through tracing the contour C, the integral path is altered by an intervention changing the path to encircle the point z=0, does this guarantee the integral \\\\( \\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) will differ from zero?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the contour to enclose z=0 does not alter the outcome because \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) remains free of singularities and branch cuts, ensuring that the Residue Theorem still results in an integral of zero, regardless of whether z=0 is encircled.",
