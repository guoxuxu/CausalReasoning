  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation system defined by \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x K(x,t) y(t) dt \\\\) where K is a kernel function involving complex operations. We evaluate the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(x,t) = K(x,t) \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(x) \\\\) resulting from a kernel of unknown form, is it possible to determine unequivocally whether \\\\( K \\\\) or \\\\( K' \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the form of the kernel solely based on output \\\\( y(x) \\\\) is generally implausible without additional information, as multiple kernels can yield similar or even the same results under certain conditions. The effect of the complex exponential, specifically, can be masked by other factors in the equation.",
