  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are matrices. This system is affected by applying an integration transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int z(t) dt \\\\). We assess how the system behaves with or without this transformation, and how interventions could influence results over time.\n\nGiven observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we deduce the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), we cannot accurately trace back to the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The integration process could mask or modify the influences of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), making it ambiguous to deduce the initial conditions.",
