  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t,x)]\\\\) at time t = T, can we recover the initial condition \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(0,x)]\\\\) without knowing any specific details about the spatial evolution or initial spatial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution equation in the frequency domain following the Fourier transformation remains linear and reversible for this unidirectional wave equation. The inverse Fourier transform applied to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t,x)]\\\\) adequately recovers \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(0,x)]\\\\), since the effect of time evolution under linear translation is known and invertible.",
