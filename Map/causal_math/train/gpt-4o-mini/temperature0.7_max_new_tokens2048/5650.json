  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts respectively, which are governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We further analyze the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we deduce the original vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\(e^{Ct}\\\\) can significantly alter the interpretation of \\\\(z_0\\\\) from the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\), making it ambiguous whether transformations were applied or not. Both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\), interacting with \\\\(C\\\\), can yield scenarios indiscernible from just the endpoint data, losing clarity on initial conditions.",
