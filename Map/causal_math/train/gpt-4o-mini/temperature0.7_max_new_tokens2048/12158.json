  "Problem": "Imagine a system where the temperature distribution on a plate is modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), and as an experiment, a function \\\\( h(u) = e^{-kt}u \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant) is applied at different times to alter the temperature pattern.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a separate function \\\\( j(u) = u + et \\\\) (where \\\\( e \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the properties of the Laplace equation and not on the interventions \\\\( h(u) \\\\) or \\\\( j(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( j(u) \\\\) introduces an additive alteration to the temperature, modifying the steady-state differently from what would have been achieved by purely evolving under the Laplace equation. Thus, the final temperature distribution depends critically on both interventions and the properties of the equation.",
