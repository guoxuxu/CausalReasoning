  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -x + z \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = x - z \\\\). We scrutinize the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(x, z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x(s) \\\\ z(s) \\\\end{bmatrix} ds \\\\) where A is a matrix given by \\\\( A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nGiven only the measurements of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the transformations applied, can we reverse calculate precisely the initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\), \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h \\\\) was applied from t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the integral transformation involving matrix exponential makes it nonlinear and dependent on the entire path of evolution, not just initial states. This nonlinearity masks the initial condition especially when the transformation alters phase properties fundamentally.",
