  "Problem": "Let's analyze the behavior of a particle moving in a complex potential field described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = p(t) + iq(t)\\\\) where \\\\(p(t)\\\\) and \\\\(q(t)\\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates in a plane and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z + F(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\(F(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent force function.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) an additional damping factor represented as \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha > 0\\\\), is introduced to the system, will the subsequent trajectory of the particle for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) still reflect the characteristics governed by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) fundamentally alters the dynamics of the system by reducing the amplitude over time. This interference means the resulting motion is governed by both \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), with the damping effect increasingly dominating as time progresses.",
