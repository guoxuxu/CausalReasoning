  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that represents the temperature distribution over a rod, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We analyze the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification \\\\( h(u) = u + \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the heat equation's constant k and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the system's state again, making the final temperature distribution dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and k. The superposition of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) along with the heat diffusion governed by k results in complex interactions affecting the final state at any time T > t_1.",
