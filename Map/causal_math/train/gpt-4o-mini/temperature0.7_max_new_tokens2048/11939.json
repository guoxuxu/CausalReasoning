  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number frequency parameter. This function represents a complex exponential oscillation. Analyze the transformation with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state with a phase shift intervention, can we determine the exact value of the phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) just by analyzing at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the presence of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be clearly identified, the exact value of the phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) affects the complex phase of the spectrum at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but cannot be uniquely determined due to potential ambiguities introduced by periodicity in the phase representation.",
