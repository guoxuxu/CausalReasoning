  "Problem": "Consider a response system described by \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty h(t) x(z-t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transform applied to the system's output, where the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the output's Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and knowing the intervention used (the filter \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied), can we determine whether the original system's response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was used prior to intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the presence of the original impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) without extra information about either \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) \\\\) or additional frequency-specific information is challenging because the transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) reflects the compounded effect of both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Thus, ambiguity remains regarding whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was used as it is compounded with the effects of the intervention.",
