  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) defines a transformation in the complex plane, with \\\\(x\\\\) as an initial complex number and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as a real constant frequency. We explore the effects of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on this function and the implications on the frequency-domain representation.\n\nCan we perfectly deduce \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) solely from the Fourier-transformed data, without knowledge of the time-domain representation?",
  "Explanation": "While the frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) can be accurately deduced from the location of the peak in the frequency spectrum, the initial amplitude \\\\(x\\\\) cannot be determined without information about the phase or normalization used in the Fourier transform process.",
