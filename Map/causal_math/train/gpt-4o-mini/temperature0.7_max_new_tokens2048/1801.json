  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as a complex exponential \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which undergoes transformations under various operations mapped in a complex function space. The transformations are represented by the operators \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Lz(t) = e^{kt}z(t) \\\\) for some real constant k, and \\\\( M \\\\) as \\\\( Mz(t) = e^{ht}z(t) \\\\) with h being another real constant.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T without the intervention of L?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{(i+k)t} \\\\). Hence, the trajectory changes fundamentally right from the start, leading to a different final state at time T, \\\\( e^{(i+k)T} \\\\) compared to \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\).",
