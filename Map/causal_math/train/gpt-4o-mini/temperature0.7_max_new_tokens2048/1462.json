  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The effect of an external input characterized by the matrix function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) is analyzed, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely reconstruct the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T knowing only the matrix M and not N?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of N, and knowing only the transformation caused by M, it cannot be guaranteed to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) since the initial condition could have been transformed by any arbitrary instance of N which modifies the subsequent evolution under M.",
