  "Problem": "We examine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a second-order differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{z} = -\\\\omega^2 z + \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) represents an external driving force. We explore the impacts of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the system.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\ddot{z} = -\\\\omega^2 z + \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same differential equation up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) modifies the initial state dynamically by introducing a time-dependent phase shift. This change affects how the solution responds to the driving force \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\), producing a different trajectory and final state at any nonzero T.",
