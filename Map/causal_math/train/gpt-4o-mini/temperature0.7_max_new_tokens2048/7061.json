  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the continuous Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-domain signal. We analyze the impact of a modulation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf the modulation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( f'(t) = f(t)e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\), and then transformed by Fourier transform, will the frequency spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{f}'(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the same as the unmodulated signal \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) shifts the frequency spectrum of the signal by \\\\( -\\\\alpha \\\\) units, as specified by the frequency shift property of the Fourier transform. Thus, the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{f}'(\\\\omega) \\\\) will be \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega - \\\\alpha) \\\\), different from the original \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
