  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\), where k is a complex constant, and its response to the Laplace transform deformations described by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention by adding a term \\\\( e^{ht} \\\\) (where h is another complex constant) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time t = 0, will the resultant Laplace transformation depend neither on k nor on h?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} + e^{ht} \\\\). This alteration significantly changes the Laplace transform result to \\\\( L(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-ik} + \\\\frac{1}{s-h} \\\\). Therefore, the transformed function distinctly depends on both parameters k and h.",
