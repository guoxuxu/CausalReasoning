  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z = \\\\int_0^T e^{st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is used to transform an input function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over a time interval [0, T] with a complex parameter s. The effect of transformations \\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\) and its inverse \\( h(t) = \\\\frac{f(t)}{t^2} \\) (for t ≠ 0) are analyzed on the transformed function z.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to an input function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and we calculate \\\\( z_g = \\\\int_0^T e^{st} g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), will \\\\( z_g \\\\) at T equal the original \\\\( z \\\\) calculated without using \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) modifies the input function, which directly affects the outcome of the integral. The presence of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) in the integrand changes substantially, altering the resulting transformation.",
