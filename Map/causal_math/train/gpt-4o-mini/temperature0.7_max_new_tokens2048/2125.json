  "Problem": "Consider a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( F(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is an initial function. This scenario examines the effects of various manipulations on the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) in terms of how it impacts \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf we replace \\\\( g(s) \\\\) with another function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) from the start, without any other interference, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be directly affected by this change?",
  "Explanation": "Replacing \\\\( g(s) \\\\) with \\\\( h(s) \\\\) changes the integral input, directly affecting the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the direct dependence of the integral outcome on the function being integrated. The transformation will yield a different \\\\( z(t) \\\\) because it fundamentally changes the initial conditions.",
