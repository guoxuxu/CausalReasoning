  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\( u(x, 0) \\) after observing \\( u(x, t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( F(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the Fourier transform was applied, the evolution of \\( u(x, t) \\) under the heat equation is well-defined and reversible for both the original and transformed states. The linearity and reversibility of the heat equation in both the spatial and frequency domains ensure that \\( u(x, 0) \\) can be accurately recovered from \\( u(x, T) \\).",
