  "Problem": "Examine a response system governed by the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\) of a function \\(x(t)\\). Assume an exponential function \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) acts on \\(x(t)\\) and modifies its behaviour in the Laplace domain.\n\nIf incorporation of an impulse response \\(g(t) = \\delta(t-\\tau)\\) is added at time \\(\\tau\\), will this intervention impact the modified Laplace transform \\(X(s-k)\\) calculated from \\(e^{kx}x(t)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The impulse response \\(g(t)\\) acts as a Dirac delta function shifting \\(x(t)\\) by \\(\\tau\\). In the Laplace domain, this appears as an exponential factor \\(e^{-s\\tau}\\) multiplicative to \\(X(s)\\), subsequently affecting the overall Laplace transform of the product \\(e^{kx}x(t)\\).",
