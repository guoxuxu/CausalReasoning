  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + vu_x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a velocity constant. We are analyzing the effect of applying a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), on the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we reconstruct \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) accurately without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the system under both the direct PDE and its Fourier transform maintains a one-to-one correspondence between initial and future states. Thus, the initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) can be accurately determined from \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) regardless of the application of the Fourier transform.",
