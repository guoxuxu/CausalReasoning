  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system having an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). An operator \\\\( G \\\\) defined by \\\\( Gx(t) = x(t - \\tau) \\\\) acts as a delay of \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds on the input.\n\nSuppose another operator \\\\( F \\\\) which performs amplification by a factor \\\\( a \\\\) is applied after \\\\( G \\\\) is used on the input signal. Will the final output only reflect the combined effects linearly, i.e., first the delay by \\\\( G \\\\) followed by amplification by \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operations of \\\\( G \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) are linear transformations. \\\\( F(Gx(t)) = ax(t - \\tau) \\\\), and thus when convoluted with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it results in an output amplified by \\\\( a \\\\) and delayed by \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds: \\\\( y(t) = a(x(t - \\tau) * h)(t) = a(x * h)(t - \\tau) \\\\. This showcases the linearity and sequential application of effects.",
