  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We look at how the Laplace transform affects this function over the variable t, focusing on the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we alter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a different value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) and continue evolving the function, will the function's Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z')(s) \\\\) still depend only on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the function to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), thus altering its Laplace transform to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\). The final Laplace transform depends on the new \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), showing dependence on the intervention.",
