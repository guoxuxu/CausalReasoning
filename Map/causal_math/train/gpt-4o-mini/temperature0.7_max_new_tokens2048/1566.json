  "Problem": "Investigate the stability of a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number denoting angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We consider the effect of an external transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t > 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous. The complex scaling by \\\\( c \\\\) could have altered both magnitude and phase, making \\\\( z_0 \\\\) not uniquely recoverable based solely on the observed trajectory.",
