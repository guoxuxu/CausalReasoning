  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit with resistors, capacitors, and inductors described by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, I is the current, and V(t) is the input voltage at time t.\n\nIf the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is set to a sinusoidal function at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the resulting current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at t = T also be sinusoidal if the circuit is purely resistive (L = 0 and C = infinity)?",
  "Explanation": "With no inductance and infinite capacitance, the circuit acts as purely resistive; therefore, the differential equation simplifies to \\\\(V(t) = RI\\\\). This implies that the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) will directly follow the voltage input and will also be sinusoidal.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The input voltage V(t) influences the current I(t) in the circuit. The inductance L affects the current I(t) by its rate of change. The resistance R impacts the current I(t) based on the voltage and current relationship. The capacitance C affects the current I(t) through its integration with respect to time. The current I(t) can also influence the voltage V(t) in the circuit.",
