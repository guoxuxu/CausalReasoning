  "Problem": "Consider a system where a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where A is a constant complex number. The function influences the trajectory over time t.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) be accurately determined from observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) after time T, without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied before evolving the system?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, there are multiple possible original values \\\\(z_0\\\\) that could have been altered in a way that results in the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\). The effect of A on the trajectory introduces ambiguity in deducing \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
