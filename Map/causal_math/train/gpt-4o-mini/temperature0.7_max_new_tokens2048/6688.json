  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the effect of differentiating this function and the subsequent application of a Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a differentiated and phase-shifted version of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can the original function and the specific intervention (phase shift) be accurately determined?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the differentiated and phase-shifted function will reveal the frequency component, but disentangling the original function and identifying the exact phase shift value from the Fourier transform alone is challenging. The phase information in the Fourier Transform does not uniquely determine the phase shift applied to the original function; it could correspond to multiple possible phase shifts or none due to symmetry in the Fourier transformation.",
