  "Problem": "Consider a system where the surface area of a sphere changes over time according to the radius which grows linearly with time according to the equation \\\\( r(t) = kt \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. The rate of change of the surface area, \\\\( S \\\\), with time can be derived using the formula \\\\( S = 4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\). We examine how transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(r) = \\\\alpha r(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a scaling constant, influence the rate of change of the sphere's surface area over time.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(r) = \\\\beta r(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another scaling constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final surface area \\\\( S(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(r) \\\\) further modifies the radius, and thus the surface area, introducing another scaling factor. The final surface area \\\\( S(T) \\\\) depends on the multiplicative effects of both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), as well as the growth constant \\\\( k \\\\), altering the sphere’s surface area trajectory significantly.",
