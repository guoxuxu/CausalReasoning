  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let's explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) after applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and a spontaneous intervention of \\\\( u(s) \\\\) at some unknown time \\\\( s_1 \\\\), can we uniquely determine the time \\\\( s_1 \\\\) of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform mixes the effects of the original function and the intervention, making it challenging to reverse engineer the exact time of intervention solely from the end result, as the contributions of both parts to the integral are fused into a single value.",
