  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network where the voltage across a circuit element is governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( V(s) = H(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) represents the complex impedance of the element and \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is the transformed input current. The effect of an intervention by adding a parallel impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to the system is studied.\n\nConsider that at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is added in parallel. Will the new voltage \\\\( V'(s) \\\\) at any time after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depend only upon \\\\( I(s) \\\\) and not on the nature of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a new impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in parallel modifies the overall impedance of the circuit. The resultant voltage, \\\\( V'(s) \\\\) will depend on both the input current and the combined effect of the impedances \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) since the overall impedance of the circuit changes.",
