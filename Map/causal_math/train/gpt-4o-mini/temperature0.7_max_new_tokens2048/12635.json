  "Problem": "We consider the effects of the Laplace Transform on a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix, and study how this affects the system's response. We implement the transform \\\\(g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\) and analyze its impact on the solution over the complex variable s.\n\nCan we determine precisely what transformations or interventions were applied (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both), solely by observing the endpoint in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint in the s-domain could potentially result from various combinations of the transformations and interventions, due to the broad effects these can have on the system's dynamics in the frequency-domain. Since both the Laplace transform and the square function modify the dynamics in specific yet overlapping ways, it is impossible to uniquely identify the specific transformations applied just from the final state.",
