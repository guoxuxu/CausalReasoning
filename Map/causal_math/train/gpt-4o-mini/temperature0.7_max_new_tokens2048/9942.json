  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the equation \\\\( U(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) where k is a positive constant. The particle's motion is transformed by a change of coordinates given by \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied, the scaling by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) might have changed \\\\( x_0 \\\\) by an exponential factor, which we cannot uniquely determine just from observing the position at time T.",
