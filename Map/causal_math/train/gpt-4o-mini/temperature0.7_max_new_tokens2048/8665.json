  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where the initial condition is \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). We explore transformations using the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\) without further intervention, will the function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T compare to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions and expected behaviour of the function over time due to the integration and the exponential function inside \\\\( T(z) \\\\). This transformed initial condition leads to a change in the evolution path from what would have been observed if no transformation was applied initially.",
