  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) maps complex numbers to other complex numbers, defined by \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) for a real matrix A. The evolution of the function is then impacted by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) known from integral transforms, specifically \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(x) \\\\) operates on a complex input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and transforms it to \\\\( z(x_0) \\\\), then allowed to be processed by \\\\( L \\\\) without further transformation, will \\\\( L(z)(x) \\\\) at x be influenced by the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) transforms the input based on the matrix A, and upon applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\), the integration will include the transformed state \\\\( z(x_0) \\\\), thus influencing \\\\( L(z)(x) \\\\). The matrix A and the initial value \\\\( x_0 \\\\) both play a critical role in the resulting output after integration.",
