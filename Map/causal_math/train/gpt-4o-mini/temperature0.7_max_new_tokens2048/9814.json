  "Problem": "Analyze the integral transformation \\\\( F(p) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(x) = cos(x) \\\\), where p represents a complex number. We study how changing the parameter p affects the transformation and the resulting function.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) at \\\\( p = 2 \\\\), can we infer the original function's form to be \\\\( cos(x) \\\\), assuming no knowledge about the transformations made by \\\\( p \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether and how p was manipulated, the resulting transformation \\\\( F(p) \\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\( f(x) \\\\), as different functions could yield similar transformations under different p conditions.",
