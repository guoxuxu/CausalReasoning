  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subject to a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. We also consider the effect of an integral transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ks} z(s) ds \\\\) over a time interval [0,T], where K is another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T and knowing that there were no interventions, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) based solely on the final state and M?",
  "Explanation": "Since the solution to the differential equation is given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{Mt}z(0) \\\\), and assuming M is invertible, we can uniquely solve for \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as \\\\( z(0) = e^{-MT}z(T) \\\\). This reverse transformation is unique due to the properties of linear transformations in complex spaces provided by the invertibility of the matrix exponential.",
