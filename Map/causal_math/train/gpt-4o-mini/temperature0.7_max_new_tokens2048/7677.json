  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) defines a transformation in the complex plane, with \\\\(x\\\\) as an initial complex number and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as a real constant frequency. We explore the effects of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on this function and the implications on the frequency-domain representation.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) is Fourier transformed over time t, will the peak in the frequency spectrum occur at \\\\(\\omega\\\\) without additional operations?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\(e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) are constants, directly extracts the frequency components of the signal. The result is a delta function at frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\), indicating a peak in the frequency spectrum exactly at \\\\(\\omega\\\\).",
