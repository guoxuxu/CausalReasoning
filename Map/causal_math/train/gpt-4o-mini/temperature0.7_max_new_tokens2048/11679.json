  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with conductivity k. An initial heating pattern v(x) is applied as an initial condition and after a time period, a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x,t)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) is a heating function, is introduced.\n\nIf an intervention by the heating function h(x,t) occurs at time t1 such that \\\\(g\\u2028(u) = u + h(x, t)\\u2028\\\\) is applied, will the final temperature distribution u(x, T) for T > t1 be independent of the initial condition v(x)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution u(x, T) will depend on both the initial temperature distribution v(x) and the heating function h(x,t). The addition of h(x,t) at time t1 modifies the subsequent evolution of the system, making the final state a result of both the initial condition and the intervention.",
