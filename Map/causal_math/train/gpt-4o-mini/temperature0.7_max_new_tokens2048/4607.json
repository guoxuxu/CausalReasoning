  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing the angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time is analyzed.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( U[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the characteristics of both transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The interaction of the two transformations, \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\), introduces additional complexity. The final state \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) will reflect the combined effects of both transformations, where each contributes differently depending on their integration limits and exponential factors.",
