  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are harmonic functions. The transformation considered here is the complex exponential transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\).\n\nIf we observe \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial point \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), it is not possible to accurately trace back to the exact initial point \\\\(z_0\\\\) because the transformation could have significantly altered the initial conditions, and the general solution of \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\) depends sensitively on those conditions.",
