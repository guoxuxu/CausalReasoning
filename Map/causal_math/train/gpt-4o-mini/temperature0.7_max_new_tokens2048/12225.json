  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact original initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) after observing the system state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at any time t, without knowing if the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the Fourier transform, we cannot uniquely determine whether to apply the inverse transform on \\\\( u(t) \\\\). Thus, two different initial conditions, one being the Fourier transform of the other, could lead to irreversibly different states under \\\\( L \\\\), making exact reconstruction impossible.",
