  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where u and v are real-valued functions of time governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\lambda)z + k|z|^2z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega, \\\\lambda\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants. The scenario explores the consequences of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the complex function's behavior over time, with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) as a complex constant.\n\nDoes the application of transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time t = 0 modify the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > 0, assuming the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\lambda)z + k|z|^2z \\\\) with no further transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) scales and potentially rotates the initial condition, affecting the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time. The nonlinear term \\\\( k|z|^2z \\\\) is also influenced by initial condition scaling, thus changing the trajectory and thus the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
