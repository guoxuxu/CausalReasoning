  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation being considered is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by dynamics under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\) without additional interventions, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was merely evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition and adds a frequency-based rotation, causing the trajectory in the complex plane to differ from that of just evolving under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\), which typically represents a simple rotational dynamic without scaling.",
