  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z}\\\\) and its effect through a contour integral \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\), where C is a closed contour path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of modifying the path C to another path C' and the use of another complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nIf at some point during the computation a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting computation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C h(w) dw \\\\) be independent of the initial function g?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) replaces the original function \\\\( g(w) = e^w \\\\). Thus, the outcome \\\\( f(z) \\\\) becomes entirely dependent on \\\\( h(z) \\\\), irrespective of the initial function \\\\( g(w) \\\\), provided there are no additional constraints or links between g and h.",
