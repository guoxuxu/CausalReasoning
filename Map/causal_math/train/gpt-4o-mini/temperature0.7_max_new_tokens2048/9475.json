  "Problem": "Consider a model described by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function. An external influence is introduced by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( j(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the initial transformation parameter \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), the system's intrinsic parameter \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), and the intervention parameter \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\). The compound effect of exponential scaling from both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\) along with the rotational dynamics introduced by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) means the state at T is influenced by all parameters.",
