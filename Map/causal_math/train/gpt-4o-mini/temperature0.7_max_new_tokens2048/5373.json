  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t)\\\\,dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( w(t) \\\\). This transformation modifies how we analyze the behavior of signals and systems in engineering and physics.\n\nIf \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a function representing a physical signal modified to \\\\( w'(t) = w(t) + h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is another function, will the Laplace transform \\\\( z(w') = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w'(t)\\\\,dt \\\\) be identical to the transform of \\\\( w(t) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( z(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of the signal by adding \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies its original form, therefore changing the result of the Laplace transform. This transformation is linear but sensitive to changes in the function it acts upon, resulting in a different transform outcome than that of the unmodified \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
