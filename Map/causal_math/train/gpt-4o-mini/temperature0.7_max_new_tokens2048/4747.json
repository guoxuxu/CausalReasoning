  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are looking at how integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, affect the function over time.\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\)) is introduced as an intervention at time t = 0, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) still exclusively reflect the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention, the modified function becomes \\\\( z(t) = e^{-(\\alpha - i \\omega) t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this function is \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i \\omega} \\\\), indicating that the pole of the transform, and hence the frequency component observed, includes the effect of the damping factor along with the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
