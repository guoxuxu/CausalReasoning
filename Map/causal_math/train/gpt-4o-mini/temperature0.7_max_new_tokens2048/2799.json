  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We introduce a transformation \\\\(T(x) = Mx\\\\) where \\\\(M\\\\) is also a matrix that modifies the system prior to solving for \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point before solving, a new transformation \\\\(U(x) = Nx\\\\) (where \\\\(N\\\\) is another matrix) is applied on top of the initial transformation \\\\(T\\\\), does the final solution still remain unaffected by \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\(U(x)\\\\) further complicates the original system by altering it to \\\\(ANMx = b\\\\). Hence, both \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) will affect the outcome, altering the relationship and potentially the solution space, depending on their properties in relation to \\\\(A\\\\).",
