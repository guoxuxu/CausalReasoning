  "Problem": "Consider a periodic signal described by the function \\\\( v(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi) \\\\). The signal undergoes various modifications using a linear operator represented by \\\\( L \\\\) that performs a convolution with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specifically designed to alter phase and amplitude.\n\nBased on the observed final signal \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine which operations were applied (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both), merely by analyzing the signal characteristics at T?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) could modify phase, amplitude, and possibly other signal characteristics, determining which specific operations were applied from the final signal form alone is challenging. The convolution effects could overlap, making it impossible to distinguish the contributions solely by final signal analysis.",
