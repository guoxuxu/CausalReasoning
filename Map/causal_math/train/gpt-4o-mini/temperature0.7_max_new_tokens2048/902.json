  "Problem": "In a complex analysis scenario, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\), integrating over the variable s. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time t, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency parameter.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the exact value of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) provides the net effect of the integral, but it does not uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as different frequencies could potentially produce the same effect through different paths in the complex plane. Knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional information about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) makes it impossible to infer the frequency precisely.",
