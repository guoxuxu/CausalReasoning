  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the impact of a transformation using Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation defined by another integral transform \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-\\\\lambda t} z(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on matrix \\\\( D \\\\) and not on the effects of \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) modifies the function in another domain, potentially altering the subsequent dynamics as observed through Fourier transform. The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both transformations, and thus, the Fourier transform reflects changes due to both \\\\( D \\\\) and the effects introduced by \\\\( G(z) \\\\).",
