  "Problem": "Consider a system that is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a vector field representing velocity. We investigate how performing a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), affects the evolution of the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nKnowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), and using only this information, can we exactly determine what the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was, without knowledge of the Fourier transform applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation given by the Fourier transform and its inverse provides a one-to-one correspondence between the initial and evolved states under the conditions of the problem. Thus, given \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), one can compute back to determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",
