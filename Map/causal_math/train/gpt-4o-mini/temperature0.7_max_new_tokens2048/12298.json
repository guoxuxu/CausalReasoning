  "Problem": "Consider a response system described by \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty h(t) x(z-t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transform applied to the system's output, where the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf, at some point during the observation, an additional filter described by another impulse response \\\\( g(t) \\\\) (with its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) \\\\)), is introduced, will the Fourier transform of the output \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) after this intervention reflect only the properties of the original impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a filter \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies the system by changing the overall impulse response to the convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Thus, the output's Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) will reflect the combined effects of \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) \\\\), not just \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
