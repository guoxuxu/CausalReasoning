  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(x, y) = \\\\int_{0}^{y} e^{At} x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent vector function. We assess how applying an operational matrix \\\\( H \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) when integrated to time \\\\( y \\\\).\n\nIf the operational matrix \\\\( H \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( x(t) \\\\), transforming it to \\\\( Hx(t) \\\\) before performing the integral transformation, does this affect the outcome of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) at the integration limit \\\\( y \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( H \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes the integrand from \\\\( e^{At} x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{At} Hx(t) \\\\), which influences the outcome of the integral. The transformation modifies the contributions of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) within the integral, thereby altering \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\).",
