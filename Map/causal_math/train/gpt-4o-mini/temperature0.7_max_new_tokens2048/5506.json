  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{N\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing if transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied during its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is ambiguous because the transformation could fundamentally alter the function's initial state, especially given the dependency on the exponential of N which affects the integral.",
