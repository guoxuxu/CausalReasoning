  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant voltage source V and a linear resistor R in series with a capacitor C. The charge Q on the capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\\\frac{V - Q/C}{R}\\\\). We study the impact of applying a sinusoidal function \\\\(f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) as an external forcing term to the circuit.\n\nIf, in addition to \\\\(f(t)\\\\), an instantaneous intervention applies a secondary function \\\\(g(t) = B \\\\cos(\\\\phi t)\\\\) during the evolution, will the charge \\\\(Q(T)\\\\) at T be dependent only on the values of R, C, and V, unaffected by parameters A and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The second intervention with \\\\(g(t)\\\\) introduces another external influence, making the final state of Q(T) dependent on both the parameters of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and \\\\(g(t)\\\\). The combined effects of these sinusoidal forcing functions determine the subsequent behavior and final state of the charge on the capacitor.",
