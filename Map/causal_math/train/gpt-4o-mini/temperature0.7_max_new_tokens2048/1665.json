  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We analyze the impact of integral transformations using convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\) over the real number line.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without any other intervention, will the resulting function after convolution preserve the properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with a Gaussian kernel acts as a smoothing operation, significantly altering the properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). This results in a fundamental change in the function's behavior, especially in terms of its local features and sharp changes.",
