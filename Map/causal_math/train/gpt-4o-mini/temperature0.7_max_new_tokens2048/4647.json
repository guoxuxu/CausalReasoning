  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real scalar constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the changes in the function under different transformations and interventions, especially focusing on transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real scalar constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, affecting the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) which now depends on B, C, as well as A. The transformations and the additional application of \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) after time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influence the system's trajectory, leading to a complex outcome that depends on A, B, and C.",
