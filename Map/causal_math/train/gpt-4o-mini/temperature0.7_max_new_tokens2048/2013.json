  "Problem": "Consider the linear integro-differential equation governing a system: \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(x, t) y(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) are known functions. We're investigating the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( y(x) \\\\) and then studying the system's behavior under transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y(x) \\\\) initially and then the system evolves under its differential equation without further intervention, will the transformed system at \\\\( X \\\\) after time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( y(x) \\\\) evolved without applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the initial condition by switching to frequency domain. The evolution under the modified conditions, especially dealing with the integro-differential nature and the specific functions \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\), will diverge from the untransformed system's trajectory.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function p(x) influences the first derivative of y with respect to x, which in turn affects the second derivative of y. The function g(x, t) determines the integral of g(x, t) multiplied by y(t). The combination of the second derivative of y and p(x) times the first derivative results in y itself. The function y(x) can be transformed into its Fourier Transform, which leads to the behavior of the transformed system. This transformed system behavior ultimately influences the evolution of the system after time t, while y(x) also independently affects the evolution of the system after time t.",
