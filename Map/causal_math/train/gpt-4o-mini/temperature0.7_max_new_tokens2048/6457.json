  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that governs temperature distribution over a rod, described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant. Assume that \\\\( u(x,0) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) as the initial condition. We observe the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant, over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the given heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at time t be the same as if \\\\( \\\\sin(x) \\\\) was evolved directly under the heat equation to time t?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the initial temperature distribution by adding \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) to it. This alteration changes the solution of the heat equation, since the evolution will now also depend on how the added exponential term disperses heat along the rod.",
