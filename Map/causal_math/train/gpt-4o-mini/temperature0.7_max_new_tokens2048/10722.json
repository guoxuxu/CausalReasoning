  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. A linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + \\\\alpha z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. We investigate how \\\\( L \\\\) affects the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of operator \\\\( L \\\\), it's uncertain if the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T has been modified by the added constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The transformation due to \\\\( L \\\\) might have altered either the amplitude or phase or both, which obscures the original characteristics of the function.",
