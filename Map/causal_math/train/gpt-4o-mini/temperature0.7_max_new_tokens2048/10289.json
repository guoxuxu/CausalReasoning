  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) which is a complex exponential representing oscillatory behavior with a constant \\\\( C \\\\) and angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\). An operator \\\\( T \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as follows: \\\\( Tz(t) = z(t + h) \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a time-shift constant.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 and the function evolves naturally without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the operator \\\\( T \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( T \\\\) introduces a time shift to the function, which alters the phase of the complex exponential by \\\\( e^{i\\omega h} \\\\) at each point. This change permanently shifts all subsequent states of the system, leading to a different state at any time T.",
