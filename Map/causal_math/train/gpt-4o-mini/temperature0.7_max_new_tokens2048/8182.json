  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\). We are examining the effects of a subsequent operation using the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of a modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nGiven the output of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the parameter \\\\( a \\\\), it is impossible to correctly back-calculate to the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), as the exponential term \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) alters the frequency-domain representation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), affecting the Laplace Transform results uniquely depending on \\\\( a \\\\).",
