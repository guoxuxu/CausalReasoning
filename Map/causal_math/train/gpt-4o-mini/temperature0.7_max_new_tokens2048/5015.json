  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system under a specific transformation, where \\( z(t) \\) represents a complex function of time \\( t \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), with \\( \\omega \\) constant. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is utilized to study the system's frequency domain characteristics.\n\nIf an intervention is made by changing the frequency \\( \\omega \\) to a new value \\( \\omega'\\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the Laplace transform uniquely reflect this frequency change across all times?",
  "Explanation": "The modification at \\( t_1 \\) introduces a discontinuity, resulting in a Laplace transform that reflects both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega' \\) in different parts of the frequency spectrum. The transform is now a composite that indicates multiple characteristics rather than a single unaltered behavior.",
