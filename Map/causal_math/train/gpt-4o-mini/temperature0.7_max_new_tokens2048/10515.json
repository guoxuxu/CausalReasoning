  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We investigate the effect of multiplying the original signal by an exponential function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at}g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is the original signal and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf an intervention occurs by filtering the signal with a transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the new Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of the resultant signal solely depend on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) rather than the original \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\( h(t) \\\\) creates a convolution effect in time domain, corresponding to a multiplication in the s-domain. This alters the resultant Laplace Transform to depend on the convolutive integration between \\\\( e^{at}g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), making it influenced by \\\\( G(s) \\\\), \\\\( a \\\\), and the characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
