  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), transforming it into the frequency domain as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the observed \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) without knowing the operator \\\\( L \\\\), just by inversely applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of L, it isn't definite how the transformation affected \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) over time; thus, reconstructing the exact initial conditions from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) only by inverse Fourier without considering \\\\( L \\\\) is uncertain.",
