  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation under the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F \\\\). The Fourier Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift is introduced, transforming the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta) t} \\\\) for some constant \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\), and then the Fourier Transform is applied, will the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) remain a single peak at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a phase shift modifies the frequency of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\). Thus, the peak in the Fourier Transform spectrum shifts accordingly to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\). The spectrum will not contain the peak at the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but instead at the altered frequency.",
