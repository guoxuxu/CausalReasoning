  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(x) \\) defined in the complex plane and a contour integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is a closed path in the complex domain. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation \\( T(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) to the function before integrating.\n\nIf, during the integration process, the function undergoes an additional transformation \\( S(z) = z^2 \\), will the final result \\( \\int_{\\gamma} T(S(z(x))) \\, dx \\) depend solely on \\( T \\) and not on \\( S \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) contribute to the final state of the integral. \\( S \\), applying a square function, can create new or remove existing singularities, while \\( T \\), being a reciprocal function, will further modify these conditions. This leads to a cumulative effect that is dependent on both transformations.",
