  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse used in solving differential equations. Suppose \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) and the differential equation given is \\\\( y'' + 3y' + 2y = f(t) \\\\) with initial conditions \\\\( y(0) = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( y'(0) = 0 \\\\).\n\nIf an external function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) is introduced at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and used to modify the system's dynamics, will the ultimate form of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) still solely be governed by \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as an intervention changes the system's dynamics, leading to a different non-homogeneous term in the differential equation. The new total driving function becomes a combination of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), changing the subsequent behavior and solution of \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
