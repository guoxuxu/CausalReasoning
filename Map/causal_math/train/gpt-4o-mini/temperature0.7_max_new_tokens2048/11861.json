  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is analyzed under the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being a constant phase shift.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, determining whether the initial state was \\\\( 1 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{i\\theta} \\\\) is impossible only by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The observed final state could correspond to multiple, indistinguishable scenarios due to the unknown phase shift \\\\( \\theta \\\\).",
