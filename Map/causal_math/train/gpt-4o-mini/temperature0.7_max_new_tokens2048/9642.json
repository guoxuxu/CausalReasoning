  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. The causal implications are explored by applying a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) to the system.\n\nCan the original initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\) knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), but not the time path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), and the Laplace transform of the output, it is possible to uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\). This stems from the ability of the Laplace transform to encode initial conditions within its form, making the initial state recoverable.",
