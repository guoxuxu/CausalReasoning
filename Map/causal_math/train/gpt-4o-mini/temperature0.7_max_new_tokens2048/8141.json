  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod, denoted by \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To study the effects of external factors, an intervention is modeled by multiplying the initial temperature distribution by a function \\\\(h(x) = e^{-ax}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial temperature profile \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be identical to evolving \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) directly under the heat equation to time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the initial temperature profile, which affects the solution to the heat equation, leading to a different temperature distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\) compared to just evolving \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\). The function \\\\(h(x) = e^{-ax}\\\\) specifically impacts how heat distributes across the rod, accelerating cooling in areas where \\\\(x\\\\) is larger.",
