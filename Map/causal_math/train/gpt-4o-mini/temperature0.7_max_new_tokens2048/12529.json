  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a real variable y depends on x through the relation \\(y = x^2 + 2x + 1\\). We study the transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) and examine its impact on y, in the context of solving the related differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 2 \\).\n\nAfter observing \\( y = 16 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\), can we deduce whether g(x) was applied to a previous value of x without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( y = 16 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\) only reveals the current state, not how x attained that value. Since \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\) is not injective due to its quadratic nature, multiple transformations or direct evaluations might lead to the same \\( y \\), obscuring the causal path.",
