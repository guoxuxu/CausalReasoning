  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influenced by an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')dt' \\\\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\), without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had been initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Because the transformation involves integration and an exponential modifier that alters the beginning state, the exact initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be recovered uniquely only from \\\\( z(T) \\\\); the presence and the nature of the integral transformation impact the back-tracing of initial conditions without prior knowledge of its application.",
