  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega \\tau}z(\\tau)d\\tau\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be exactly reconstructed at any time \\\\(t\\\\) from the transformed function \\\\(T(z)\\\\) without additional information or reversions?",
  "Explanation": "The process of transformation by \\\\(T\\\\) involves integration that typically loses some phase information from the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), making precise reconstruction of the original function impossible without further information about initial phases or additional transformations.",
