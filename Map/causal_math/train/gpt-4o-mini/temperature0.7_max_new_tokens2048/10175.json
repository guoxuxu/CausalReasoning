  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where ω is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. A Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(ω) = \\\\int_{-∞}^{∞} z(t) e^{-iωt} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is multiplied by a damping factor \\\\( e^{-αt} \\\\) (where \\\\( α > 0 \\\\)) before applying the Fourier transform, will the transform \\\\( F(ω) \\\\) still show a peak exactly at \\\\( ω \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the damping factor modifies the original function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt}e^{-αt} \\\\), which changes the frequency response. The resultant Fourier transform shifts the peak from \\\\( ω \\\\) due to the damping, leading to a broadened response and not a peak exactly at \\\\( ω \\\\).",
