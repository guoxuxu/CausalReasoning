  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over the interval [0, T].\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{T} e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\)) is applied as an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint \\\\( T \\\\) depend only on the original differential equation and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new scope of integral transformation starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), affecting the trajectory and final expression of \\\\( z \\\\) by adding influences unique to the interaction between \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and the evolving function. This makes \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the original dynamics and the new transformation.",
