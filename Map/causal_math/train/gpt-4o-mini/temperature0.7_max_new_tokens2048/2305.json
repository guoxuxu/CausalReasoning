  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = cos(x) + i sin(x) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let us examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( z(x) t= e^tx \\\\) on this complex function over a time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( e^tx \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the function is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z(x, t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) represent a rotation in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^tx \\\\) results in \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{e^T x} \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), which simplifies to \\\\( cos(e^T x) + i sin(e^T x) \\\\. This represents a rotation by \\\\( e^T x \\\\) radians in the complex plane, hence maintaining the rotational property of the original function.",
