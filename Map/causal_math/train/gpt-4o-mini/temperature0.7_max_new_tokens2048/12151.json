  "Problem": "Investigate the effects of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, on a real variable system \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) under both normal evolution and perturbed conditions.\n\nGiven the observed outcome of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) following an intervention, can one discern whether the initial affecting function was \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or the intervention function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), based solely on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Because \\\\( x(t) \\\\) naturally evolves independently from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and is only influenced by real value changes like those introduced in \\\\( h(x) = x + \\cos(t) \\\\), the final value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not give any specific clues about the presence or role of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) versus the direct impact of the intervention.",
