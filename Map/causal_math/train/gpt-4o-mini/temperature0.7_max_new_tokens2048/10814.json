  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source influences the system described by \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) being added to certain regions at specific times.\n\nBy only observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without any intervention, can we uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The thermal diffusion process described by the heat equation tends to smooth out temperature variations over time, making it inherently lossy in terms of information about specific initial distributions unless very precise data and accurate inversion techniques are available.",
