  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where f(t) represents a time-dependent function and s is a complex number. An input signal f(t) is being studied for its transformation and response properties under different conditions and manipulations.\n\nBy observing the Laplace transform output \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information about modifications or conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific form of \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), it uniquely corresponds to \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) under standard Laplace transform assumptions. The characteristic form of the output makes it possible to directly deduce the form of the input signal.",
