  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a linear time-invariant system where the complex impedance (Z) of the circuit is formulated as \\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} \\), and s is the Laplace transform variable. We explore the effects of adding a parallel capacitor with impedance \\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\) to this system.\n\nAfter observing the system's response with the capacitor, is it possible to mathematically recover the original system's impedance \\( Z(s) \\) accurately without knowing the value of C?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the capacitor value C, the new poles introduced by the parallel capacitor remain unknown, which prevents accurate determination of the original system's characteristics solely from the altered response.",
