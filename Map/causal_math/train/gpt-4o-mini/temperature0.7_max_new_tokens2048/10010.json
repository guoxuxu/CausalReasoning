  "Problem": "Analyze a complex dynamical system represented by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and z is a complex function. The evolution is studied under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nBy knowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) prior to applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), without additional data on whether the transformation was used?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), ambiguity remains about the initial conditions due to the potential modification induced by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). The presence of D, especially if it does not commute with C, may render \\\\( z_0 \\\\) indiscernible from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
