  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We investigate the role of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\(F(u)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\), applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed system's state \\\\(F(u)(k, t)\\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to simply transforming the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and allowing evolution under L will affect the system differently than directly transforming at a later time. The evolution of u under L and its interaction with different wavenumbers k, determined by the Fourier transform, will generally produce different outcomes when comparing these two processes.",
