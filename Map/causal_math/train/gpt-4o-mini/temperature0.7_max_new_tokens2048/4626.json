  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the input signal and \\\\(e^{i\\omega s}\\\\) is a complex exponential function used for frequency analysis. The transformation aims to filter or modify the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nObserving a significant response in \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T, can we infer that \\\\(x(t)\\\\) was necessarily of frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a significant response in \\\\(z(t)\\\\) could result from any components in \\\\(x(t)\\\\) that are at frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\), but it can also include contributions from other frequencies due to the integral's comprehensive nature over time. Components close to \\\\(\\omega\\\\) or harmonic frequencies might also contribute significantly.",
