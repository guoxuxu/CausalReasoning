  "Problem": "We examine a system governed by the heat equation in a rod, \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(x\\\\) is the position along the rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal conductivity. Consider an initial sinusoidal temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\pi x)\\\\). Suppose an external heating function \\\\(h(x, t) = H e^{-t}\\\\sin(\\\\omega x)\\\\) is applied, modifying the temperature.\n\nIf the heating function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is not applied and the rod is left with the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\), will the temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for any T > 0 be simply the solution of the homogeneous heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Without the heating function, the system evolves strictly according to the homogeneous heat equation. The solution will purely depend on the diffusive properties described by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) with initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).",
