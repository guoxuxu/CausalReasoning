  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), showing simple harmonic motion in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. Let's investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\) applied to z(t).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially set and evolves according to its definition without any intervention, will the result of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at any time t depend on the initial function definition alone?",
  "Explanation": "Since no intervention alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) will compute based solely on the predefined function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). The transformation outcome at any time t depends directly on this initial set function, reflecting the integral of the harmonic motion in the complex plane.",
