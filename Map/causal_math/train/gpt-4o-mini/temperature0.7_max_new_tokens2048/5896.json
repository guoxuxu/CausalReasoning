  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t. Analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the function.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the complex exponents can variably combine phase shifts and magnifications, different combinations of a and b could yield the same final point \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This multiplicity means without additional data on the specific transitions or without constraints on a or b, the exact sequence of interventions cannot be uniquely determined.",
