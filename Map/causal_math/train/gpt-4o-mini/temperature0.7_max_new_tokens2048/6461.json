  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of the integral transformation \\\\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\\\) on the function \\\\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf we apply \\\\\\( T[f(t)] \\\\\\) to \\\\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), then let \\\\\\( T[f(t)] \\\\\\) naturally evolve without further manipulation, does the output \\\\\\( F(s) \\\\\\) remain purely as a function of \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) without any additional factors?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\\\( F(s) \\\\\\) after applying the transformation \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) is a Laplace transform of \\\\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), which yields \\\\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\\\). This expression is derived purely from the properties of \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\), and no other factors will alter this result due to the linear nature of the Laplace transform.",
