  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices, and x is the initial condition. We examine the effects of an input transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we precisely deduce the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) from the system output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) (specifically the matrix D) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original vector x from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) since both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( Dx \\\\) could potentially lead to the same or different outputs depending on the properties of D relative to C and A.",
