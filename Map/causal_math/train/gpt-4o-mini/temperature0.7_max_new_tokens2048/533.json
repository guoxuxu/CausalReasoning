  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^3 + iy^2 \\\\) in the complex domain, where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers. Analyzing this as a complex function involves studying transformations such as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoing a rotation and a stretching described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 = h(x_0, y_0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z \\\\) evolves over time t under \\\\( z = h(x(t), y(t)) \\\\) without further intervention, will the function value \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z = h(x(t), y(t)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial complex number by rotating and stretching. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) can significantly modify how \\\\( z \\\\) evolves, leading to different values at any future time \\\\( T \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The variable x directly causes the value of z, and the variable y also directly causes the value of z. The value of z undergoes a transformation when g(z) is applied, which is influenced by the complex constant A and the time variable t. The initial complex number z_0 is derived from the function h(x_0, y_0) and evolves over time to become z(t) based on the functions of x(t) and y(t). Therefore, z(t) at time T is influenced by the variables x(t) and y(t) and can also be traced back to the initial value z_0.",
