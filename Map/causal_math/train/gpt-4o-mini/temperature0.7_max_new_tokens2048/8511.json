  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex variable. We explore the effect of modifying the system using a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming the original to \\\\( y'(t) = (y * h)(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying another Laplace transformable function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at some time, modifying our system to \\\\( y''(t) = (y' * g)(t) \\\\), will the new transform \\\\( Y''(s) \\\\) depend only on the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), irrespective of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform \\\\( Y''(s) \\\\) is a product of all involved transforms, specifically \\\\( Y''(s) = Y(s)H(s)G(s) \\\\), where \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Therefore, it depends on both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), along with the original \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",
