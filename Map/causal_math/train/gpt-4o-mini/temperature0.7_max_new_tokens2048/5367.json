  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator equation \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\). Analyze how utilizing a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) a constant, affects the system over a time-scale \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(S(x) = e^{i\\phi}x\\\\) (where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\phi\\\\) another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\theta\\\\) or \\\\(\\phi\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both interventions, \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\), simply introduce a phase shift without altering the dynamics governed by L. Hence, the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depends solely on the scaling factor \\\\(e^{\\lambda T}\\\\) determined by L, despite the phase shifts introduced by \\\\(\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(\\phi\\\\).",
