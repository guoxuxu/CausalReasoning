  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the influence of a Fourier transform on this function as an intervention.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we know the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\), one can work backwards from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) using the inverse of the integrating factor and other manipulations to precisely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The differential equation provides a unique solution traceable from any given state back to its initial condition.",
