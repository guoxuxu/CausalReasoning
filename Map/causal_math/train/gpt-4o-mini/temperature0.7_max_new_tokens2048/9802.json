  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nFrom the resultant function at t = T, can we precisely deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation involves integration with an altering factor \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\), reversing this effect to uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from the output at any t = T is generally not possible without additional information about the transformation specifics.",
