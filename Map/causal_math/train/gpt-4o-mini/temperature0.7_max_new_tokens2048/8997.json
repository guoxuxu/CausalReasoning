  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the Laplace transform domain, where a is a constant. This function corresponds to the solution \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} u(t) \\\\) in the time domain, with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) being a step function. We analyze the impact of multiplying by another function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\), corresponding to \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} u(t) \\\\) in the time domain, and where b is also a constant.\n\nIf the product \\\\( h(s) = z(s) \\\\times g(s) \\\\) is applied as the initial transform and then inverse Laplace transformed, will the time-domain result \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at any time t be the same as if only \\\\( z(s) \\\\) had been applied and inverse transformed?",
  "Explanation": "By multiplying \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( g(s) \\\\), which corresponds to convolution of \\\\( e^{at} u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} u(t) \\\\) in time domain, resulting in a new function \\\\( t e^{(a+b)t} u(t) \\\\). This demonstrates that the dynamics and output in the time domain are substantially altered by the convolution, making it different from the case where only \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is used.",
