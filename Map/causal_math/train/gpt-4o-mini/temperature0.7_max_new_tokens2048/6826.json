  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. To analyze this scenario, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) at different times.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the transformed output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any alterations or additional inputs?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) can lose information about the original function, especially since it is affected by the integration and complex exponential factors. This transformation can represent multiple possible original functions that could produce the same output under the given transformation, especially without knowing the exact conditions or additional parameters.",
