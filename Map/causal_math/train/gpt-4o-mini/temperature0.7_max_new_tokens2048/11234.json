  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and we study its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at some time T, can we reconstruct the exact original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves an integral with a complex exponential which may lose information about the initial phase and frequency changes over the interval. This loss of information prevents exact reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional data.",
