  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\) is used to transform a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) into a complex function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) of a complex variable \\\\(s\\\\). We then apply an inverse Laplace transform to retrieve \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\), can we always determine the original time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform is designed to uniquely recover \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\), assuming all necessary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Laplace transform hold. Thus, \\\\(f(t)\\\\) can be determined from \\\\(F(s)\\\\).",
