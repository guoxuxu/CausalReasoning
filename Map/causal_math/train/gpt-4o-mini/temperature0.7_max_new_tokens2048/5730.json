  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) applied on the initial condition vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in a linear system governed by the matrix equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), with M being a constant matrix. The interaction is studied under different transformations by incorporating another matrix function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be exactly reconstructed from observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T, without any information about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial intervention by \\\\( h(x) \\\\), any transformations caused by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) might have altered the initial conditions in ways that are not reversible uniquely. This uncertainty, compounded by the action of M, precludes an exact derivation of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
