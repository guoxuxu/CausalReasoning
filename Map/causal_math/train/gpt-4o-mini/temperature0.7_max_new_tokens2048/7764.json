  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is analytically mapped using a Mobius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, d \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were used (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), there could be multiple combinations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and initial states that result in the same endpoint due to the nature of Mobius transformations and their ability to widely vary the path and final positions in the complex plane.",
