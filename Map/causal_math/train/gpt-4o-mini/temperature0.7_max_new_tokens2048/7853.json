  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine how an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, affects the system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the system evolves under the differential equations without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) for any T be invariant under the initial conditions set by \\\\( u(0) \\\\) and \\\\( v(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) combined with the differential evolution introduces a dependency on the paths taken by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), which are determined by the initial conditions. Since the transformation integrates over an evolving trajectory, the final state is not invariant under different initial conditions.",
