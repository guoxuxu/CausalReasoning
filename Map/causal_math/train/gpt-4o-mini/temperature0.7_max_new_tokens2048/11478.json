  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing trajectories in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is affected by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b\\\\overline{z} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 if the evolution was governed only by \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the presence of the complex conjugate term \\\\( b\\\\overline{z} \\\\) in the operator \\\\( L \\\\), multiple initial states could potentially lead to the same outcome at \\\\( T \\\\), depending on the magnitudes and phases of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). This ambiguity prevents the unique determination of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
