  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, obeying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\). We study the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial differential equation and not on k or \\\\( \\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another level of complexity and modifies the trajectory further by scaling the magnitude. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both k and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), in addition to the behavior dictated by the differential equation itself, shaping a trajectory that deviates significantly based on these constants.",
