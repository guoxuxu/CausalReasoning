  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). The system's evolution is examined under the impact of this transformation over time t.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( N \\\\) (another matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both interventions \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), besides the angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), influence the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\). The transformations can change both magnitude and phase, affecting the trajectory even if they occur at different times.",
