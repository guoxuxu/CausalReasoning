  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) occurred, it is not possible to accurately deduce \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The quadratic transformation could have altered the magnitude and phase trajectory, leading to ambiguity in inferring the initial state.",
