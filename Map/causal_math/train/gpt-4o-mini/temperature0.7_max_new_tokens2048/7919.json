  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), respectively, with constants a and b. Analyze the behavior of the function after applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention at any time t_1, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be affected only by the constants a and b but not by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional phase rotation, thereby depending also on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since these transformations influence the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) throughout its evolution, the final state at t = T is not solely dependent on the original system constants a and b.",
