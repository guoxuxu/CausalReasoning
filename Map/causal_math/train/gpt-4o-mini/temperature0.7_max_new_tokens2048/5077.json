  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We study the influence of the transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) introduces a scaling and rotation based on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), respectively. This modifies the trajectory such that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) differs due to exponential growth or decay and additional rotation induced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
