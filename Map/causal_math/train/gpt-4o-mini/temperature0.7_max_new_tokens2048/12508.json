  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + At + B \\\\), where A and B are constants. Analysis is done on the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Uz \\\\), where U is a constant matrix, that modifies the trajectory of z.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\), then let evolve under the original function without further transformations, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be purely quadratic at t=T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) transforms the initial conditions by multiplying it by the matrix U. This modifies not just the initial value but potentially the entire trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making it include linear components influenced by U even at time T.",
