  "Problem": "Analyzing the system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi)\\\\) applied to the function u(x, t), and how it evolves over time.\n\nCan we accurately reconstruct the initial function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from its state at \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T, knowing only the evolved Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) without interference?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming that the operator L and its corresponding spectral representation are known and invertible, the initial function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) can be reconstructed from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform and the inverse of the spectral operator applied over time.",
