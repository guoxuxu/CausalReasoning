  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a linear operator in a complex function space. We investigate how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention involving the inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively depend on M?",
  "Explanation": "The application of both \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and its inverse \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\), changing its state path significantly. While M dictates the system's general behavior, the transformations applied modify how and which attributes (time or frequency) are affected until time T.",
