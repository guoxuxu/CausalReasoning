  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real parameter representing angular frequency. The function describes a pure harmonic oscillation in the complex plane. Now, consider the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nConsidering the waveform observed at \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to conclusively determine whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both were applied during the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the state at \\\\( T \\\\) does not provide enough information to delineate the sequence or type of transformations applied (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both). Multiple transformation paths could result in the same endpoint, especially when the transformations involve nonlinear operations such as powers, which mask the original and intervening influences.",
