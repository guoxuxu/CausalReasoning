  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) defined on the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( f'(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) where a, b, and c are complex constants. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nHaving computed \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for some z, can we uniquely determine the earlier function f(z) at any arbitrary point z' within the interval [0, z], without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation is a-many-to-one mapping in general because it involves accumulation of function values, losing information about specific intermediate points z' unless the path or derivative changes at those points are known, making it generally impossible to revert to original f(z') values uniquely.",
