  "Problem": "Consider a system of equations governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is applied to this system resulting in the transformed function \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification in the kernel to \\\\( K'(t,s) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the function \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the original or modified kernels?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new kernel \\\\( K'(t,s) \\\\) alters how the past states of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) contribute to \\\\( u(T) \\\\), making the outcome dependent not just on L, but also significantly on the form of the original and the modified kernels.",
