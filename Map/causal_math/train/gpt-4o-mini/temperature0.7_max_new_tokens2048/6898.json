  "Problem": "Assess the interplay between a time-varying voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) applied across a linear system with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\. The output voltage across the system is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (v * h)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the system response \\\\( y(t) \\\\) over time, can we determine the exact form of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) without any prior knowledge of \\\\( V_0 \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The calculation of the exact voltage function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) from the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or amplitude \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is not feasible solely from the output due to the infinite number of possible combinations that could result in the same convolution result, unless additional data or constraints are provided.",
