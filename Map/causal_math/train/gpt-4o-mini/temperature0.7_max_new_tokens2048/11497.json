  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where an input signal \\( x(t) \\) is passed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution with an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). The transformed signal \\( y(t) \\) is then subjected to a Fourier transform, generating \\( Y(\\omega) \\).\n\nDoes the resultant frequency domain representation \\( Y(\\omega) \\) depend solely on the input signal \\( x(t) \\) without considering the impulse response \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( Y(\\omega) \\) depends on both the input signal \\( x(t) \\) and the system's impulse response \\( h(t) \\) due to convolution; thus it is not solely based on \\( x(t) \\). The Fourier transform of the output \\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\) results in \\( Y(\\omega) = X(\\omega)H(\\omega) \\), showing dependency on both \\( X(\\omega) \\) and \\( H(\\omega) \\).",
