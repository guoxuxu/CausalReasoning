  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x) \\) defined in the complex plane, where \\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\). We are interested in the mappings done by \\( \\phi(z) = z^2 \\) and explore how these transformations affect \\( z \\) as \\( x \\) varies along the real axis.\n\nGiven the final \\( z(x_3) \\), can we specifically distinguish whether \\( \\phi \\), \\( \\psi \\), or both were applied throughout the transformations, just by knowing \\( z(x_3) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used to achieve \\( z(x_3) \\) is challenging without clear records of the applied functions \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\psi \\). The final state could potentially be achieved through various sequences of these transformations, and the ambiguity in complex function transformations along with non-linear characteristics prevents precise backtracking of interventions.",
