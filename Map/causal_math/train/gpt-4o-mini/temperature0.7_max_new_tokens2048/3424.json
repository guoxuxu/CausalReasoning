  "Problem": "Consider a system involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions governed by linear differential equations, and i represents the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were executed (whether \\\\( f(z), g(z) \\\\), or both), only by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing the functions for x and y?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may be reached by different sequences or magnitudes of interventions because of the non-uniqueness of the rotational transformations introduced by \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\). These transformations can overlap or negate each other's effects, making it impossible to identify exactly which transformations were applied.",
