  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number. Further, an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied, which maps the function into the Laplace transform space.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a new value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), and the Laplace transform is recalculated, will the new transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) depend exclusively on the new \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) and disregard the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Any changes to the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) directly affect the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), hence the transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) will reflect the state based on the new \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\). The original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) no longer influences the transformed function once it's changed.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function z(t) evolves according to the differential equation governed by the constant real number ω, which influences the rate of change of z(t). Modifying ω to a new value ω' results in a change in the rate of change of z(t), impacting the calculation of the Laplace transform Z(s). Therefore, the new Laplace transform Z'(s) will depend on the modified ω' and not on the original ω.",
