  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is analytically mapped using a Mobius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, d \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) exactly after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, just by solving \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of the Mobius transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately backtrack to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had altered it. The rotational motion under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) alone does not provide sufficient data to reverse-engineer the effects of \\\\( f \\\\).",
