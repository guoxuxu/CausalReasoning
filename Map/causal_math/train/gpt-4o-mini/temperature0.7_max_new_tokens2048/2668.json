  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\\\), where k is a positive constant. The system undergoes an analysis involving a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nGiven the spectrum of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after an unknown intervention, can we determine precisely which decay parameter (k or m) was adjusted during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier spectrum of the system at T only indicates the total effective decay rate and not whether the additional decay was intrinsic (k) or due to an intervention (m). The response is integrated and does not separately reflect the individual contributions from k and m.",
