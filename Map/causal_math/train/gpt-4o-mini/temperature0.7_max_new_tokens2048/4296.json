  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = R(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\) describing the trajectory of a particle in the complex plane, where \\\\( R(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the radial and angular components, respectively. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), by only knowing the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of phase shifts introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), including their different magnitudes and timings. The non-linear interactions between these transformations make it challenging to ascertain the exact interventions used based solely on the final state.",
