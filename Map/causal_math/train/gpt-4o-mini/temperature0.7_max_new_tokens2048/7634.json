  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t)\\\\) initially and after an intervention defined by multiplying by a modifier function \\\\(m(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing the specific details of the linear operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of L, we cannot accurately reverse-engineer the system's evolution, even though the Fourier transform itself is invertible. L's characteristics crucially determine how \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) changes over time.",
