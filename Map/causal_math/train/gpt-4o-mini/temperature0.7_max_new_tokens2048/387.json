  "Problem": "A complex line integral is evaluated along different paths in a complex domain. The function is \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and the integral paths are circles centered at 0 with varying radii. We explore the impact of modifications to the path (change in the radius).\n\nIf the radius of the path initially set at 1 is modified to radius 2 at mid-calculation, and this change is considered as an intervention, will the resulting integral still be \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the radius during the integral calculation does not affect the end result so long as the path continues to enclose the pole z = 0 and no additional poles are crossed. The integral of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) along any such path remains \\\\(2\\\\pi i\\\\).",
