  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. The effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, is investigated.\n\nIs it possible to reconstruct the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without confirmation whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to backtrack uniquely to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) might have altered the initial conditions in irrecoverable ways, especially if matrices Q and P do not share special properties like commutativity.",
