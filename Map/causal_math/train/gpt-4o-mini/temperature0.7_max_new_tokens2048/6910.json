  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, C is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We examine the impact of transformation \\\\( h(z) = De^{iBt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is a complex constant matrix and B is another real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition, without knowledge of its application, one cannot accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the early modification by D could not be distinguished solely by the final observation, especially considering that complex matrix transformations may include rotations that are not easily reversible.",
