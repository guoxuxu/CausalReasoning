  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its derivative \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it}\\\\) in a system over time, focusing on how transformations affect causal inference.\n\nKnowing the form of \\\\(z(t) = e^{(i-t)t}\\\\) at time T can we infer if the function \\\\(f(t) = e^{-t}\\\\) was initially multiplied with \\\\(z_0\\\\) without any other data?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T does not provide sufficient information to uniquely backtrack and confirm the initial multiplication or its absence, as different initial conditions may converge to the same output due to the complexity of the exponential interactions.",
