  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, is used to transform the initial condition.\n\nCan we infer the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial state may have been augmented by \\\\( g(x,0) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), altering the evolution path. Without this knowledge, the original state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) cannot be deduced solely from the observation at t=T because possible differences induced by M are unknown.",
