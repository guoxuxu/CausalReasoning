  "Problem": "Consider a system of first-order differential equations where the rate of change of a vector function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\), with \\\\(M\\\\) being a constant matrix and \\\\(N\\\\) a constant vector. The system is affected by a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = Qz + R \\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(R\\\\) a constant vector.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by mapping \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Qz_0 + R \\\\) before the differential equation begins to evolve it. This initial modification alters the trajectory and leads to a different state at time T than would occur from evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly.",
