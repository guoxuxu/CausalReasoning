  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over an interval [0, t].\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve up to time T without further transformation, will the function retain the form of \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alters the function significantly due to the integral, resulting in a function that no longer strictly represents the original exponential waveform. The effect of the transformation accumulates over the interval, changing the nature of the function compared to its initial form.",
