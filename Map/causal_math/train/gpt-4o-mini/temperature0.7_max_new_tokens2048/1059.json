  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined on the real axis, \\\\( u(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is transformed using the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v(t) = u(t)e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, and then the Laplace transform is applied, will the result be independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the function to \\\\( v(t) = e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha) t} \\\\). Applying the Laplace transform yields \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(v)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\), which clearly still depends on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The transformed output is a function of both the original frequency and the intervention parameter.",
