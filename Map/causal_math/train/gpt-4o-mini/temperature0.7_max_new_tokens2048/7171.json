  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) with variable \\\\(t\\\\) representing time. We study the effects of a transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) and explore causal relationships and interventions in the temporal evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the propagation function \\\\(e^{it}\\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention effectively squares the magnitude and doubles the frequency of the phase angle at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), affecting the subsequent evolution of the system. Therefore, \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is influenced by the intervention (altering both magnitude and phase), indicating dependence on both the natural propagation and the effect of the intervention.",
