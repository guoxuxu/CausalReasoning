  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We then apply a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, to the function at time t.\n\nIs it possible to exactly determine the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just by observing the evolved function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which fundamentally alters the initial function, it is not feasible to backtrack unambiguously to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The effect of B complicates the direct association between the observed final and initial states.",
