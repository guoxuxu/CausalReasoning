  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We analyze how the integral transformation \\\\(X(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, influences the state over time.\n\nCan we precisely infer the original state \\\\(z_0\\\\) based solely on the knowledge of \\\\(X(T)\\\\), without information if any transformations other than \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The inability to attribute specific effects to either the matrix \\\\(A\\\\) or \\\\(B\\\\) or their interaction complicates reversing the process to uniquely determine \\\\(z_0\\\\). The integral transformation masks the effects of the underlying dynamics, making it non-trivial to reverse-engineer the original state.",
