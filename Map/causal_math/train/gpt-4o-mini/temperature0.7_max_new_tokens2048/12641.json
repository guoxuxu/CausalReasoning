  "Problem": "Consider a linear reaction-diffusion system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) on a domain [0, L] with Neumann boundary conditions, where D is a diffusion coefficient and c is a reaction term. We examine the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{0}^{L} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\) applied to this system.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) accurately without knowing the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible, and information about the initial state is preserved through the evolution under the PDE. Knowing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), one can apply the inverse Fourier transform and the properties of the linear PDE to reconstruct \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) precisely.",
