  "Problem": "Consider an integral transform scenario where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} x(s) ds \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and y is a constant vector, is applied to the system, and we are interested in understanding its effects at time T.\n\nIs it possible to determine both the initial setup (B, y) and the changes made at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (C, w) by observing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and overlapping effects of multiple exponential transformations integrated over time contribute to a scenario where multiple combinations of B, y, C, w might yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, it’s not possible to uniquely differentiate all initial and intervening factors from the end state alone.",
