  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a material is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effect of an external heat source, which is modeled as \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), added to specific points in the material at time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nKnowing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately identify the specific interventions made (either \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) or \\\\( j(x, t) \\\\) or both) throughout the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Given the end-state temperature distribution, multiple combinations of heat sources and their intensities might yield similar distributions due to superposition and diffusion effects. It is therefore impossible to deduce from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) alone whether \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), \\\\( j(x, t) \\\\), or both were applied, and in what manner.",
