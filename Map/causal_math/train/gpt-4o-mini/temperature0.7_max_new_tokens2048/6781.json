  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( g(x) \\\\) before the transformation, where \\\\( Lg(x) = xg(x) \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( Lg(x) \\\\) and then \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is computed for \\\\( Lg(x) \\\\), will \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be equal to the original transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without applying \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) changes the function to \\\\( xg(x) \\\\), thus altering the integrand in the transform to \\\\( e^{-sx} xg(x) \\\\). This results in the derivative with respect to \\\\( s \\\\) of the original transform, \\\\( -G'(s) \\\\), due to integration by parts, which clearly differs from \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
