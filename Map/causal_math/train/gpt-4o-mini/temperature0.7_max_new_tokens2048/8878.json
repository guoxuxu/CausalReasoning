  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{B(x-s)}u(s)ds \\) on the solution \\( u(x,t) \\), where B is another constant coefficient.\n\nCan we deduce the original initial condition \\( u(x,0) \\) after observing \\( u(x,T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( T(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\( T(u) \\) was applied, the evolved state \\( u(x,T) \\) with its possibly altered distribution due to convolution cannot uniquely determine the original initial condition, especially since the convolution might dampen or amplify certain features of \\( u(x,0) \\).",
