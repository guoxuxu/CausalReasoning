  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a vector function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x \\\\, dt \\\\) over a time period T, where A is a square matrix. We examine the changes induced by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix.\n\nBy examining the result \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), can we infer the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) used, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) can alter the initial condition in a way that is indistinguishable after integration unless additional information about D is known. Since D can significantly alter the initial state, different initial vectors could produce the same integrated result depending on the nature of D and A.",
