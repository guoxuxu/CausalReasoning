  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). We examine how the system evolves with and without the application of \\\\( T \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the function state at time T, can we unambiguously determine if the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied and at what time without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, and at which point, just from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging without further data. The resultant state could be due to complex combinations of natural evolution and integral intervention effects, especially if multiple applications or durations of \\\\( T \\\\) could hypothetically yield similar results.",
