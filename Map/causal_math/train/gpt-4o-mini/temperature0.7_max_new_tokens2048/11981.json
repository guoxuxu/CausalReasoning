  "Problem": "Analyze the effect on signal transduction in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution operation with an impulse response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This study involves examining the introduction of a Fourier transform of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) transformed by a function \\\\( F(w) \\\\) and its implications on the system's output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the system, can we unambiguously determine the original input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform \\\\( F(w) \\\\) was applied to it?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( F(w) \\\\) changes the spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in a way that might not be discernible solely from observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\), especially without additional information about the transformation characteristics of \\\\( F(w) \\\\).",
