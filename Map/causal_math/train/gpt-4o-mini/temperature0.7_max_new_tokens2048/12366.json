  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), with \\( B \\) also a constant matrix, is applied at time \\( t \\). We explore the effect of this transformation on the system's evolution.\n\nIf during the evolution, a second transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) (where \\( C \\) is another constant matrix) is applied at some point \\( t = t_1 \\), will \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) solely depend on \\( A \\) and not \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state at \\( T \\) after the intervention \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) is influenced by both transformations \\( e^{Bt} \\) and \\( e^{Ct} \\), along with the natural evolution due to \\( A \\). Hence, \\( z(T) \\) depends on all three - \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the complex-valued function z(t) is governed by the differential equation, where the rate of change of z(t) is directly influenced by the constant matrix A. The transformation f(z) modifies z(t) to f(z), but this transformation does not affect the governing dynamics dictated by A. Similarly, the second transformation g(z) alters z(t) at time t1, yet for any time T greater than t1, the evolution of z(T) remains solely dependent on A, independent of the transformations defined by B and C.",
