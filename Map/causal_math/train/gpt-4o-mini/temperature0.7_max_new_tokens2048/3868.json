  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a function space, defined as L[f(x)] = f''(x) - 4f(x). We are interested in how the use of an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform denoted by \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), affects the solutions of the differential equation L[f(x)] = 0.\n\nKnowing only the final expression in the Laplace domain, can you identify if the Fourier Transform was applied prior to the Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the boundary conditions, initial function behavior, or specific modifications made by the Fourier Transform, the changes induced in the Laplace domain could resemble those from various transformations or initial condition setups. It is therefore not possible to definitively conclude if the Fourier Transform was applied solely based on the final expression in the Laplace domain.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator L acting on a function f(x) leads to its second derivative f''(x) and a term proportional to -4f(x), which together define a differential equation. The application of the Laplace Transform to the function space results in solutions to the equation L[f(x)] = 0. The Fourier Transform precedes the application of the Laplace Transform in the transformation process.",
