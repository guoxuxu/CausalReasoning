  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) operating in the complex plane. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this function, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(x) = \\\\exp(i(ax+b)) \\\\) before applying the Fourier Transform, where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants, will the spectrum peak shift to \\\\( \\\\omega = a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the frequency of the function from \\\\( ix \\\\) to \\\\( i(ax+b) \\\\). This results in the Fourier Transform detecting a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega = a \\\\), as it now reflects the new inherent frequency of \\\\( z'(x) \\\\).",
