  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which maps time t onto the unit circle in the complex plane. Assuming we apply a transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), we investigate the effects and causal inferences from applying this transformation versus the natural evolution of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( f(z) = z^3 \\) is applied as an intervention, and \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is observed, will \\( z(T) \\) depend solely on the natural evolution and not on the transformations (\\( g(z) \\) or \\( f(z) \\))?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( f(z) = z^3 \\) modifies the trajectory such that \\( z(T) \\) cannot solely be determined by the natural evolution law \\( e^{it} \\). The effects of the powers and initial conditions significantly dictate the outcome, making \\( z(T) \\) dependent on both the natural evolution and applied transformations.",
