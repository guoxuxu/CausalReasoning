  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} e^{zt} dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the implication of perturbing the variable \\\\( z \\\\) through a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z + w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( G(z) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z \\\\) into \\\\( z+w \\\\) at the outset, and then \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed for this transformed value, will the function value \\\\( F(z+w) \\\\) be the same as \\\\( F(z) \\\\) when evaluated directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) = z+w \\\\) modifies the input to function \\\\( F \\\\), changing the integration from \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{(z+w)t} \\\\). Given that \\\\( e^{wt} \\\\) is not a constant factor (unless \\\\( w = 0 \\\\)), the outcome \\\\( F(z+w) \\\\) will differ from \\\\( F(z) \\\\), as the exponential function is sensitive to its exponent.",
