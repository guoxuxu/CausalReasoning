  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The system undergoes analysis under the influence of a transformation, \\\\( g(x) = Cx \\\\), with C being another constant matrix, applied at an arbitrary time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we verify the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 with certainty without knowing if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), and because C might have altered the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in an unknown way, reconstructing the exact original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from the observed state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at T is uncertain. The matrix C could have various possible forms affecting the back-calculation.",
