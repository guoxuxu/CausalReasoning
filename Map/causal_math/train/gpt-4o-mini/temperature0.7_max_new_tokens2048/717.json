  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined over the complex plane as \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number. This function is being transformed by a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) defined such that \\\\(L(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), which resembles the Laplace transform but over a modified domain.\n\nIf initially \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) is applied and transformed by \\\\(L\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(L(z)\\\\) be finite?",
  "Explanation": "The integral \\\\(L(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}e^{i\\omega t} dt\\\\) does not converge unless \\\\(s > 0\\\\) and real, because the oscillatory nature of \\\\(e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) does not contribute to the decay required for convergence in the absence of a sufficiently large real component in \\\\(s\\\\).",
