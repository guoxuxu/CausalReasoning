  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. This function is subjected to an integral transform, specifically a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is Fourier transformed without any modifications, will the transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega = w \\\\) be a Dirac delta function?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) results in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - w) \\\\), concentrating all energy at the frequency \\\\( w \\\\), which directly corresponds to the original function's frequency. Thus, the output is indeed a delta function at the specific frequency.",
