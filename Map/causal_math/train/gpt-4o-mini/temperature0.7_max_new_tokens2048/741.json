  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the system of differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = -v + cu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = u + cv \\\\), where c is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an initial transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under the given differential equations to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by rotating the complex plane, which affects the trajectory of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\). As a result, the dynamics of the system are altered, producing a different outcome at time T.",

The transformation by f(z) incorporates the angle theta, affecting the initial conditions but not altering the underlying system dynamics governed by the differential equations.",
