  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a product's inventory is driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant decay rate describing how quickly items are sold or perish. We study the behavior when applying the function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\), a sales strategy intended to reduce prices as inventory decreases, thereby potentially influencing sales rate.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial inventory \\\\( x(0) \\\\), and the inventory is allowed to evolve over time under \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t)\\\\) without further intervention, does this adjustment ensure the inventory \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t follows the same decay rate as if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) potentially modifies the sales behavior and could change the depletion rate of the inventory. The function \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x}\\\\) itself could alter how the product's price impacts sales dynamics, meaning the inventory decays differently compared to the standard model.",
