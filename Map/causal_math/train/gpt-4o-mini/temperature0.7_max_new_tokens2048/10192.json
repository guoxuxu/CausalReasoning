  "Problem": "Investigate a control system where the growth rate of a population \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\), with r being a growth constant. An intervention is performed using a function \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), where k is another constant, to modify the instantaneous growth rate at a specific time point.\n\nKnowing the population at t = T, can we definitely identify whether the intervention \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\) was applied, based solely on \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios (different values of k or variations in intervention timing) could lead to the same final population size at t = T. Without additional information, it is impossible to ascertain the specific intervention parameters or even confirm the occurrence of an intervention.",
