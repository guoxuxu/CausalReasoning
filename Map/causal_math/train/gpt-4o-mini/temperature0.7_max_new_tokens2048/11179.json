  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), for some complex square matrix A. We evaluate the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also complex matrices.\n\nIf at time t = t_1 an intervention by \\\\( g(z) = Fe^{Gt}z \\\\) (F and G being constant matrices) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend only on matrix A and not on matrices C, D, F, or G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory by applying \\\\( Fe^{G(T-t_1)} \\\\) to the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), hence the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on matrices A, C, D, F, and G. The outcome reflects changes instituted by each matrix, particularly how they influence the system dynamics through their exponential functions.",
