  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\alpha s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to precisely trace back to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the integral transform can introduce changes that resemble natural evolutions under different initial conditions.",
