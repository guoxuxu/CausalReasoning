  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\} \\\\). We study the behavior under a convolutional operation with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), such that the resulting function is \\\\( u(t) = (g * h)(t) \\\\) with its Laplace Transform \\\\( U(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( U(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The product of Laplace Transforms \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) does not provide unique information about the individual functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) due to the convolution ambiguity. Multiple function pairs can result in the same transformed product.",
