  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, is used to transform the initial condition.\n\nIf an intervening function \\\\( h(x,t) = e^{Nt}u \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), where T > t_1, entirely depend on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent state transformation due to \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) involves another exponential factor \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\), which would affect the evolution past \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The final state is influenced by M used initially, the operator L, and the intervention through N, creating dependencies on all these components.",
