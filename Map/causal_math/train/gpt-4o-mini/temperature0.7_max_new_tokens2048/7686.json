  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement and c is the wave speed. The medium through which the wave travels undergoes a transformation defined by a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original wave function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the damping factor, any observed wave form at t = T could be the result of different initial conditions modulated by the damping. Without this knowledge, uniquely reconstructing the initial wave function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) is not feasible.",
