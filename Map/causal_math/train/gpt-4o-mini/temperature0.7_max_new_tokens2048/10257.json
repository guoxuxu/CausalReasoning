  "Problem": "Evaluate the influence of a complex transformation defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) on the stability of solutions to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(w(t)) \\\\) at t = T correspond to directly evolving \\\\( w_0 \\\\) under the differential equation and then applying \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) and given that the evolution of \\\\( w \\\\) is exponential, the transformation applied initially commutes with the evolution induced by the differential equation. As exp(kw) and exp(w) are eigenfunctions of their derivatives, the proposed sequence (transformation following evolution) will result in the same outcome.",
