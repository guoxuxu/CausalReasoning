  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. We are interested in the causality implications of an integral transformation applied to initial conditions given by some function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) related to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a Laplace transform.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing it to \\\\( v(t) = t u(t) \\\\), does \\\\( h(v(t)) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) for all \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and not on the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to be transformed, which directly affects the result of \\\\( h(v(t)) \\\\). The dependency on \\\\( t \\\\) introduced by the intervention means the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\) is altered, reflecting both the original function and the intervention.",
