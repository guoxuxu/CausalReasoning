  "Problem": "Explore the system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with a given constant matrix M. Consider the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and how different initial conditions affect the system. We assume M and s are such that all operations and the inverse transform are well-defined.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) and let the transformed system evolve under the differential equation, does \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) uniquely determine the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at any time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a linear constant coefficient differential equation uniquely determines the state of the system at any time T because the transform encodes all information about the system's dynamic response to initial conditions under the effect of M.",
