  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{At} dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and exploring how its behavior changes when transformed by function \\\\( T_M(t) = Me^{At}M^{-1} \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nWill the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T T_M(t) dt \\\\) be equivalent to the matrix M times the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{At} dt \\\\) times M^{-1} under the transformation \\\\( T_M(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation preserves the integral due to the properties of matrix multiplication and similarity transformations. Specifically, \\\\( T_M(t) = Me^{At}M^{-1} \\\\) implies that the integral over this transformed function becomes \\\\( M(\\\\int_0^T e^{At} dt)M^{-1} \\\\), showing a direct calculation of the transformed integral using the change of basis defined by M.",
