  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new transformation \\\\(S(z) = e^{-i\\\\gamma t}z(t)\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome of \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(S(z)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) modifies the original function by applying a further frequency shift. This leads to a compound effect involving both the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and the intervention frequency \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), making the result of \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) dependent on both.",
