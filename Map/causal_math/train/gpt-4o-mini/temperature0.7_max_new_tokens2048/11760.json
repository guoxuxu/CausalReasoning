  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled with Laplace transforms in the complex function space, where the transfer function H(s) relates the input U(s) to the output Y(s) by Y(s) = H(s)U(s). Let's investigate how the addition of a complex pole affects the system behavior.\n\nIf we introduce an additional pole by multiplying the original transfer function H(s) with a term (s - p), where p is a complex constant, and let it evolve with the original input U(s), will the resultant output Y(s) at any point s be the same as if no pole was added?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a pole modifies the transfer function's frequency response and alters the system's behavior, resulting in a different output Y(s) for the same input U(s). This transformation changes the system dynamics, signaling a deviation from the original output path.",
