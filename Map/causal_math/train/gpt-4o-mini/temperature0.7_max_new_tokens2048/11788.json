  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real number. To analyze causal effects, we introduce interventions using the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to the complex function at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the original function without further intervention, will the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to if \\\\(z(0)\\\\) evolved directly to \\\\(t = T\\\\) under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at the beginning modifies the initial state to \\\\(e^{Ct}z(0)\\\\), significantly altering the trajectory from what it would be under just \\\\(e^{i\\omega t}\\\\). The transformation due to \\\\(C\\\\) interacts with the original system and changes the evolution path, resulting in a different state at any future time \\\\(T\\\\).",
