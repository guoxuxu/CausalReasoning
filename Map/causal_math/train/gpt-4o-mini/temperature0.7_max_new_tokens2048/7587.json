  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable z, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The question examines the sensitivity of the integral transformation under varying parameters.\n\nIf we actively modify z through a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) at some point during the evaluation process, will the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) still depend only on s?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies z, which affects the entire integral as z appears in the exponent in the integrand. Now, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends on both the parameter s and the new form of z, \\\\( z^k \\\\), indicating dependence on the intervention.",
