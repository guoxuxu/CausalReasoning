  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) in a complex domain, defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\). The causal inference involves analyzing transformations through the function and the reverse mapping from the function back to its inputs.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the values of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) given the transformed output \\\\( z' = z + 1 \\\\) without knowing the specific operation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation adds a complex number, it affects the possibility of uniquely tracing back to the original variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) might yield the same transformed output due to the square terms and introduction of the imaginary unit.",
