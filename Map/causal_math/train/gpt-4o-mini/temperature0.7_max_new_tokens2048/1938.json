  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The Laplace transform is modified by a multiplying operator \\\\( M(s) \\\\) resulting in a transformed function \\\\( G(s) = M(s)F(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we retrieve the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without knowing the operator \\\\( M(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( M(s) \\\\), the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered from \\\\( G(s) = M(s)F(s) \\\\) because different \\\\( M(s) \\\\) could lead to the same \\\\( G(s) \\\\) for different \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The inversion requires knowledge of \\\\( M(s) \\\\) to correctly adjust the transformed function.",
