  "Problem": "Let's explore a scenario involving a Laplace transform used to solve an initial value problem described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0 \\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the behavior of the solution subject to modifications by the transform \\( T(y) = y e^{kt} \\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf \\( T(y) \\) is applied to the initial solution \\( y_0 \\) of the differential equation at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the resulting \\( y(t) \\) at time T still solve the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T(y) \\) modifies the initial condition by multiplying by \\( e^{kt} \\). This transformation alters the compliance of \\( y(t) \\) with the original differential equation since the behavior of the derivative operations over \\( e^{kt} \\) introduces additional terms not canceled out by the original equation, changing the system's trajectory.",
