  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being scalar constants. The system is analyzed using a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another scalar constant.\n\nIf at some point, say \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (D being a scalar constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, be dependent solely on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation affecting both amplitude and phase of z. Thus, the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by A, B, C from the initial transformation, and D from the intervention, making it a product of multiple influences rather than only A and B.",
