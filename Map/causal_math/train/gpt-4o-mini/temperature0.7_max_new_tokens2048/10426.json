  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The complex function transformations involve \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices operating in the complex domain over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation might have altered \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in ways that are irreversible simply by observing the later state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T.",
