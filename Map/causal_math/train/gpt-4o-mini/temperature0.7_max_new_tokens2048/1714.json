  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze whether certain transformations can infer causal relationships or predict the system's behavior accurately.\n\nGiven the observed data for \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) without prior knowledge of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), can we determine exactly the original phase shift applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific value of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) applied at t = 0, it's impossible to distinguish the effect caused by the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the modified \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) based solely on observing \\\\( z'(T) \\\\). The observed data could emerge from various initial phase shifts due to the periodic nature of the function.",
