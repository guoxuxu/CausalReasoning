  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function space such that \\\\( L \\\\) represents a Fourier Transformation, and we investigate the impact of an additional operator \\\\( M \\\\) which applies a convolution transformation with a fixed kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the result of combined transformations of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the order of transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The combined effect of convolution and Fourier transformation can produce similar outcomes from different initial conditions and transformation orders. Without knowledge of the order, the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved because both transformations potentially alter the function's fundamental characteristics.",
