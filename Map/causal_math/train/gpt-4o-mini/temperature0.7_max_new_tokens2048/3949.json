  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying a Laplace Transform L on a function g(t), where g(t) = e^(At)x for a constant matrix A and an initial vector x.\n\nIf g(t) is defined as e^(At)x and transformed using L to L{g(t)}, with no other operations applied, will L{g(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * x if no initial operations are performed on x?",
  "Explanation": "When g(t) = e^(At)x, the Laplace Transform of g(t) naturally results in L{g(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * x due to the definition and properties of the Laplace Transform applied to exponential functions involving matrices, which conforms to the transform of g(t) directly without modifications to x.",
