  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions prescribed on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). An input function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) represents the external heat added per unit time. We consider the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x,t) = u(x,t) + \\\\int_0^t h(x, \\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\) on the system over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T[u] \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time T be solely determined by \\\\( u_0 \\\\), independent of \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[u] \\\\) adds the effect of the input function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) to the initial condition, which modifies the initial state of the heat distribution. As a result, the temperature distribution at any later time T depends not only on \\\\( u_0 \\\\) but also significantly on the cumulative effect of \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) over time.",
