  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix \\\\omega} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) on the solution.\n\nIf \\\\(F(u)\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if the Fourier transform was directly applied to \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and then letting the system evolve changes how the solution behaves. The differential operator \\\\(L\\\\) affects the original function in physical space, and the transform of this evolved function is generally different from transforming after the evolution due to potential non-commutative properties between \\\\(L\\\\) and the Fourier transform.",
