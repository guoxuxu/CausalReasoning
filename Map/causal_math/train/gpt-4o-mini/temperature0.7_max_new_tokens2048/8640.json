  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing a circular trajectory in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of a transformation implemented by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t and its effects on the system.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were made (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations of transformations and their respective parameter values. The overlap in potential final states arising from the interactions of magnitude and phase modifications makes it challenging to uniquely identify the specific transformations and parameters used.",
