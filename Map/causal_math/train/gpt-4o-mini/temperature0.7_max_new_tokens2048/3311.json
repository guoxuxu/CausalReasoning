  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds\\\\). We investigate how the results of further transformations and initial conditions evolve through the system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new operation \\\\(G(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-s} z(s) ds\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the system's state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the natural evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\) and not on \\\\(T\\\\) or \\\\(G\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\(G(z)\\\\) introduces an additional modification, impacting the system's trajectory alongside the initial transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\). Both the nature of \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(G\\\\) transformations, which incorporate integral manipulations with distinctive kernel functions (exponential growth and decay respectively), contribute to the final state at \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
