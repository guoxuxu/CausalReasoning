  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent real function and \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the influence of this transformation where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function having both amplitude modulation and phase shift properties based on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to ascertain what interventions (the initial transformation using \\\\( w \\\\) or the scaling using \\\\( k \\\\)) and in what order they were applied by just knowing the formula of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be the outcome of various interplays between the initial complex exponential transformation and the scaling intervention, with non-unique sequences giving rise to the same final form. The layering of effects from \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) contributes to multiple possible histories that cannot be disentangled solely based on the outcome.",
