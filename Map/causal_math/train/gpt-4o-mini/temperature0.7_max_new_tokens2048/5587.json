  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx}u(x, t)\\\\, dx \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new Fourier transform reflecting a function modification \\\\( g(u) = u + h \\\\), where h is another function of x and t, is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) is influenced by both the characteristic properties of the differential equation and the modification introduced by \\\\( h \\\\). The addition of \\\\( h \\\\) can alter the wave's characteristics, and thus the effect of A on the system—which solely governs unmodified wave propagation—is no longer isolated in determining the transformed state at T.",
