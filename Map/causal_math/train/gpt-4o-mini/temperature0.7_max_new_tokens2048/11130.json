  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents propagation in time under a harmonic oscillator dynamic with a certain frequency. We introduce an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i \\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the value of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from observing \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) without knowing the values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the integral transformation at time T depends on both the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and the integrated result over the interval from 0 to T encompasses more than just the initial state. Without precise values of these parameters, deducing the initial state from the transformed output at T is indeterminate.",
