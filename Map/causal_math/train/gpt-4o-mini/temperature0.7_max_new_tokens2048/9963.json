  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real parameter representing angular frequency. The function describes a pure harmonic oscillation in the complex plane. Now, consider the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the waveform at time \\\\( T \\\\) still reflect only the original harmonic motion influenced by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a new transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, modifying the waveform further to triple the original frequency starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which makes the resulting state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on the initial angular frequency and effects of both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\). This results in an evolution completely different from the natural harmonic motion.",
