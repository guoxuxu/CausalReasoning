  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We explore the impact of a boundary condition modification \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\), a given function, and how it affects the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) across the domain.\n\nIf an additional condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y_1) = k(x) \\\\) for some fixed y_1 is introduced as an intervention, will the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) throughout the domain still be predictable solely based on the original boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y_1) = k(x) \\\\) modifies the problem setup and consequently alters the solution throughout the domain. The system now depends on both boundary conditions, not just the initial one at \\\\( y = 0 \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The boundary condition h(x) determines the value of φ at the boundary φ(x,0), which in turn influences the solution φ(x,y) throughout the domain. The additional condition k(x) at a fixed y_1 also impacts φ at that specific point, and through this, it influences φ(x,y) across the domain. Therefore, the solution φ(x,y) is affected by both the boundary condition h(x) and the intervention k(x).",
