  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}y(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where y(t) is the response of a circuit involving a unit step function shifted by a time delay \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), and knowing a transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied, can we explicitly determine if the transformation was the square power \\\\( t^2 \\\\) or another function like \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), solely based on \\\\( Y(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to multiple transformations' ability to alter the sign and position of poles and zeros in the Laplace spectrum, it is infeasible to uniquely determine whether the input was transformed by \\\\( t^2 \\\\), \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), or another similar modification without additional information.",
