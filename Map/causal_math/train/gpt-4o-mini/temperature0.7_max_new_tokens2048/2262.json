  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over an interval [0, t].\n\nGiven the transformed state at \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) over the interval [0, T] without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) integrates the function with a decay factor \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\) which masks the details of the original function, particularly phases and amplitudes at different times. Reconstructive analysis solely from \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) is generally not feasible without prior knowledge of behavioral changes at each moment within the interval.",
