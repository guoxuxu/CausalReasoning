  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) has been applied, it is impossible to correctly back-trace \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\), as the transformation could have altered the state's trajectory by modifying its phase. The phase shift introduced can mask the original features of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
