  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Let's analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number with positive real part.\n\nGiven the transformation result \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega}\\\\), can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without knowing the form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the transformation \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega}\\\\) is directly related to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), the imaginary part of the denominator. This allows us to uniquely determine \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) despite not knowing the specific form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) beforehand.",
