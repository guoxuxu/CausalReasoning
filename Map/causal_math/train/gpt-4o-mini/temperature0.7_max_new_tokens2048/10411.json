  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is real and represents time, especially when transformed by another complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention using another function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sqrt{z} \\\\) is applied at a certain time t = T/2, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) depend only on the original function and not on the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new dynamic in the middle of the evolution. If \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, at T/2, \\\\( z(T/2) \\\\) is squared, which is then square rooted by \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Ultimately, the trajectory of z can depend critically both on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\), affecting the final state at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\). If \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was not applied and only \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, the behavior is different.",
