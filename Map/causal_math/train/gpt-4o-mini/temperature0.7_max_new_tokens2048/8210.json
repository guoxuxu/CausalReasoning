  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) used at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation applied by \\\\( f(x) \\\\) might have changed \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in a way that impacts the entire future trajectory of the integral. Without knowing the effect of \\\\( B \\\\) or whether it was applied, retracing to the exact \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is obscured, given potential multiple solutions or modifications.",
