  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is considered.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) uniquely after observing the transform at any time t without knowing additional specifics of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "As the integral transform obscures some details of the original function particularly phase information and since multiple different functions can have the same transform under T, it is not possible to uniquely infer \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) alone.",
