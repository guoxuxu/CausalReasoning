  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. Let us examine the impact of an integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, over the time interval [0, t].\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a different matrix transformation \\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\) (where \\( E \\) is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend on \\( C \\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( h(z) \\) adds another layer of complexity, potentially altering the trajectory in a way dependent on the interaction of \\( C \\), \\( D \\), and \\( E \\). The final state \\( z(T) \\) is thus influenced by all these factors, not just \\( C \\).",
