  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a system exhibiting harmonic motion in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-s\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine whether an intervention occurred at any \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The calculation of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) integrates the effect of the system state over time with a decay factor, diminishing specific features of interventions. Multiple different interventions could lead to similar or indistinguishable results in the transformed output, thus preventing a unique determination.",
