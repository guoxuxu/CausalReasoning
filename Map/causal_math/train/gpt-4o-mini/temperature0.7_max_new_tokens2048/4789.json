  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop control system where the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is passed through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is regulated to meet certain performance specifications. We investigate the implications of introducing a disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) modeled by \\\\( D(s) = \\\\frac{5}{s+2} \\\\) on the output.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied and the system evolves according to \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) affect the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) even if there is no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\), represented by \\\\( D(s) \\\\), independently adds to the system’s output alongside the input signal through the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). This affects the output regardless of any direct intervention on the input, altering the overall system dynamics.",
