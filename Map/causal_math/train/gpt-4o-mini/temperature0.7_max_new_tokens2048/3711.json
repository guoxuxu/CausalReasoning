  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. For analysis, we apply a Fourier transform to change the domain from time to frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\), which converts the time-domain function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) into its frequency-domain counterpart.\n\nIf an external force represented by a function \\\\(g(t)\\\\) is introduced into the differential equation at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) leading to a new equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = g(t)\\\\), and the Fourier transform is applied thereafter, does the frequency domain representation depend solely on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(g(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(g(t)\\\\) modifies the system's equation, resulting in a different frequency-domain representation, expressed as \\\\(-\\\\omega^2 F_x(\\\\omega) + \\\\omega^2 F_x(\\\\omega) = F_g(\\\\omega)\\\\). The output in the frequency domain now includes terms dependent on the Fourier transform of \\\\(g(t)\\\\), thus influencing the resultant frequency spectrum.",
