  "Problem": "Examine a system characterized by the non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\\\), and consider the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( g(x) = x + k \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the same differential equation without further intervention, will the result \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to what it would have been if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) changes the initial state to \\\\( x_0 + k \\\\). Given the non-linearity of the differential equation, this shift can fundamentally alter the trajectory and thus the final state at t = T, leading to a state that is not equivalent to simple untransformed evolution from \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
