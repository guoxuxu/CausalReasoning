  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another transformative factor to the system's dynamics. Hence, the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent not only on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but is also significantly influenced by the parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Their effects are cumulative or interact through the layered transformations.",
