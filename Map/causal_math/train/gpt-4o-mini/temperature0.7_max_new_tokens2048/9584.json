  "Problem": "Consider a function $z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}$ where $i$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is a real frequency parameter. We analyze the effect of a differential operator $D = \\frac{d}{dt}$ on the function over time $t$, and consider the impact of linear transformations such as $L(z) = az + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers.\n\nGiven the endpoint $z(T)$, can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether $L$, $M$, or both), only by knowing the value of $z(T)$?",
  "Explanation": "The compositional effect of complex linear transformations can lead to the endpoint $z(T)$ arising from various possible combinations of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ in $L$ and $M$. Given the myriad ways these parameters can interact to yield the same final value, determining the specific interventions from $z(T)$ alone is infeasible.",
