  "Problem": "Let's consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the system's response under the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) for a constant k.\n\nGiven the position \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\) accurately without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(x)\\\\), it's impossible to definitively determine \\\\(x_0\\\\) from \\\\(x(T)\\\\), since the position could have been influenced by the exponential factor \\\\(e^{kt}\\\\) modifying the amplitude. This uncertainty about the initial scaling results in ambiguity regarding the original state of the system.",
