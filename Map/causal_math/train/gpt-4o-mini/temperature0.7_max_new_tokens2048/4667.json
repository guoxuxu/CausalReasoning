  "Problem": "Consider a physical scenario where heat propagation in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity. We analyze the system's response to a time-dependent boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional cooling is applied at the opposite end of the rod periodically represented by \\\\( u(L,t) = \\cos(\\mu t)\\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is the length of the rod and \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is a constant, will this intervention impact the heat distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced cooling condition will alter the heat distribution across the rod, influencing the overall thermal gradient and temperature profile at any time T > t_1. The effects combine both boundary conditions dynamically as per the governing heat equation.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The thermal conductivity k influences the rate of change of temperature u_t in the rod. The boundary condition at the left end u(0,t) affects the temperature distribution u(x,t) across the rod. The boundary condition at the right end u(L,t) also influences the temperature distribution u(x,t). Time t affects the temperature distribution u(x,t). The parameter λ determines the behavior of the left boundary condition u(0,t). The parameter μ governs the behavior of the right boundary condition u(L,t). The temperature distribution u(x,t) at time t leads to the distribution u(x,T) at a later time T.
