  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} f(s) ds \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nGiven the signal output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (original, h(t), or both) were applied only by considering the outcome at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed signal \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) could result from multiple possible combinations of original signals and interventions due to the convolution-like integration process. The information regarding specific interventions used loses clarity due to the overlap of effects inherent in the integral transformation.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
