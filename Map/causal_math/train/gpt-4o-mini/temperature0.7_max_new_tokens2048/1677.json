  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z a complex variable. We examine the effect of an integral tranformation \\\\( h(g) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt} g(z) dt \\\\), with B as another constant matrix, over an interval [0, T].\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is defined over the interval [0, T] and then transformed by \\\\( h(g) \\\\), will the function \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) hold the same properties as \\\\( g(z) \\\\) multiplied by the integral factor?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation involves a convolution with another exponential function specified by B, which modifies the properties of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Depending on the relationship between A and B, the behavior of the resultant function \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) could be substantially different from a mere scalar multiplication of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
