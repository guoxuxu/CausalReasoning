  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a linear transformation on a complex function. Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, representing a unit circle in the complex plane. The transformation given is \\\\( T(z) = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) = kz \\\\) scales the radius of the circle by \\\\( k \\\\), altering the magnitude of the initial point. Therefore, while the angle traversed after time T remains the same, the radius (magnitude) is different, leading to a different complex number at time T.",
