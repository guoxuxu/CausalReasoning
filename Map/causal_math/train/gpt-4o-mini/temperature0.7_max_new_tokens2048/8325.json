  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\. The function undergoes a Fourier transform, yielding the function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by Fourier transformation without any modifications, will the result \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) contain components at frequencies other than \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) directly results in a delta function centered at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and no other frequencies are present. The transform cleanly isolates the frequency component of the original function.",
