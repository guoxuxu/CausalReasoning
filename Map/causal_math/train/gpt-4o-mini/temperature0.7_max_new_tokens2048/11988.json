  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform and its implications on signal processing.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, does the transformed function describe the frequency domain representation of the original time domain signal accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) precisely identifies the frequency \\\\( ω \\\\) in the frequency spectrum, demonstrating a delta function at \\\\( ω \\\\). This transformation is exact and reflects the frequency content of the original time domain signal accurately.",
