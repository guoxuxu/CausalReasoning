  "Problem": "Examine a system characterized by the non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\\\), and consider the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( g(x) = x + k \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nCan we precisely determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), just by observing the state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention sequences could lead to the same final state due to the non-linear properties and the addition/subtraction of a constant k, impacting trajectories differently. Thus, knowing only \\\\( x(T) \\\\) doesn't allow for unique identification of preceding interventions.",
