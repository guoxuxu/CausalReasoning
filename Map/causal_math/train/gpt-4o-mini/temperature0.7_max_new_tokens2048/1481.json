  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario, where the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined by a Fourier transform of another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), specifically \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-izt} dt \\\\). We examine the implications of changing the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) represents a delta function.\n\nIf the modification of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by adding \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then taking the Fourier transform, will \\\\( h(z) \\\\) yield the same result as if no modification was made?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) fundamentally changes \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and since the Fourier transform of \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) is 1, the new transform \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will differ by a constant of 1 across all z compared to the original transform, thus altering the output.",
