  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by the convolution integral \\\\( z(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input function, and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response of the system represented using the Laplace transform as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). We investigate the changes when applying a scaling transformation \\\\( f(x) = kx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant scalar.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(x) = m*x(T-t) \\\\) (time reversal and scaling by \\\\( m \\\\)) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on the original scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) modifies the input in a fundamentally new way by not only scaling but also reversing the time profile of the input. This changes the convolution dynamics, making the final output at time \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on both the original scale \\\\( k \\\\) and the new scale and modality \\\\( m \\\\).",
