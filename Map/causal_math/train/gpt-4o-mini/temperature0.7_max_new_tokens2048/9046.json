  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\\\) where C is a contour in the complex plane and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function. Analyze the impact of changing the contour C to another contour C' in the complex plane.\n\nWithout knowing if contour C or C' was used initially, can we infer the original contour from observing \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Unless additional properties (like specific symmetries or singularities) of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) are known, it's generally not possible to uniquely determine the contour used by observing the end value of \\\\( F(z) \\\\). Different contours could potentially lead to the same value under specific function or singularity conditions.",
