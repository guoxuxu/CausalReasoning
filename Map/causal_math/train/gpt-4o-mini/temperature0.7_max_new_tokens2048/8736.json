  "Problem": "Examine a linear system under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) and H is a constant matrix. This system is further affected by the application of a second function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely identify the interventions (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( q(x) \\\\), or both) applied during the transformation, purely based on the observed value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences and combinations of interventions with matrices D and F, along with the transformation H, can result in the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The overlapping effects of these linear transformations and their exponential influences mean it's infeasible to identify the specifics of the interventions from the endpoint alone.",
