  "Problem": "Analyzing a system under the influence of a complex function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), we examine the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The resultant transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) provides insights into the system's behavior in s-domain.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z = 0 \\\\), will \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) when \\\\( Re(s) > Re(a) \\\\) hold true in the absence of any other transformation or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) directly results in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) given that the real part of \\\\( s \\\\) is greater than the real part of \\\\( a \\\\). This relationship is a standard result from the properties of the Laplace transform for an exponential function, assuming no other functions modify the input.",
