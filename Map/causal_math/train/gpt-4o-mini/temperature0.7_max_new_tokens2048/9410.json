  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. The system is subject to manipulation by a transformation \\\\(h(u) = u + e^{Kt}\\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) after observing \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing if \\\\(h(u)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the initial application of \\\\(h(u)\\\\), retracing to \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) becomes ambiguous since \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\) may have altered the initial state in a way that is not recoverable merely through observing the system's state at a later time \\\\(t = T\\\\).",
