  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where 'a' is a constant complex number. We explore the scenario under the Fourier transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), an alteration is made to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+b)t} \\\\) for a new constant \\\\( b \\\\), and then a Fourier transform is applied to the new function, does the resulting transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) point to an influence from both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) modifies the original function to \\\\( e^{(a+b)t} \\\\), and the resulting Fourier transform becomes \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{a + b + i\\\\omega} \\\\). This reveals influences from both 'a' and 'b' as they contribute additively to the exponential's argument, thereby altering the frequency domain representation.",
