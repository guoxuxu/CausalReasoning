  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(du/dt = Au\\\\) and \\\\(dv/dt = Bv\\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) is applied, where C is a constant scalar.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information about the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) makes it impossible to uniquely reconstruct the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\). The transformation could have altered the initial conditions such that multiple possible initial states could lead to the same observed state at T.",
