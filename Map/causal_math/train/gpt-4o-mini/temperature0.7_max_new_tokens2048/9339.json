  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) concerning the spatial variable x.\n\nIf a modifying function \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant, is applied at a time t > 0, will the transformed state \\\\( V(s, t) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the intervention \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the system by modulating it with \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), and the Laplace transform of the modified function would lead to a different differential equation, \\\\( \\\\frac{dV}{dt} = (\\\\lambda - k s^2) V(s, t) \\\\). Thus, the resulting state \\\\( V(s, t) \\\\) in the Laplace domain depends on both \\\\( k \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",
