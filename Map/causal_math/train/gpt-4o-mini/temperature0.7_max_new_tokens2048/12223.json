  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} + i \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-1)s} ds \\\\), where A is a constant and i represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of z when affected by transformation \\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\), where B is another constant.\n\nKnowing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\), \\\\( h(t, z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially result from various combinations of transformations due to the modifications they introduce in magnitude and phase over time. The overlap in potential effects from each transformation makes it difficult to uniquely identify which transformations were applied solely based on the final state.",
