  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nAt t = T, observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( M \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\), the transformation applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could have various possible effects (rotations, scaling), making it impossible to reliably trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as multiple different transformations could yield the same observed outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
