  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}(t-s)p(s)ds \\\\), and where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is the input signal. The integral kernel \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) represents the system's response to the input, transitioning over time.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the input signal \\\\( p(t) \\\\) from start until T without knowing about changes in the system matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying \\\\( p(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without precise knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\) is infeasible. This is due to \\\\( e^{At} \\\\)'s potential variability in transforming the input signal, thereby making it complex to reconstruct \\\\( p(t) \\\\) solely from the resultant output.",
