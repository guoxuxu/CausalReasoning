  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) denotes the temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) applied along the rod.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied as the initial temperature distribution and the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at time t depend solely on the heat equation dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Once \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is set as the initial condition, the subsequent temperature evolution is governed entirely by the heat equation. The specific initial condition influences the distribution, but the dynamics of change over time are dictated only by the heat equation.",
