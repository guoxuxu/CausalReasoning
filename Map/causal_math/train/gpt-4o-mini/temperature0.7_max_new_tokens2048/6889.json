  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allow \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) to evolve according to the PDE without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) be equivalent to evolving \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) directly to T and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution to the heat equation behaves as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = e^{-Dk^2t}\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\). Therefore, whether we first solve the PDE in the time domain and then transform, or transform first and solve in the Fourier domain, the result is the same due to the linearity and time-invariance of the system.",
