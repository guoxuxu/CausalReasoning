  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit involving a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We analyze the response of this system to a complex input signal \\( x(t) \\) using the Laplace transform, where the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) is \\( X(s) \\) and that of \\( h(t) \\) is \\( H(s) \\).\n\nGiven the output \\( y(t) \\), can you infer the exact input \\( x(t) \\) applied to the system without knowing the impulse response \\( h(t) \\), assuming no further information about \\( H(s) \\) or \\( X(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\( h(t) \\) or its Laplace transform \\( H(s) \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( x(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\). Multiple potential inputs could yield the same output in a linear time-invariant system, particularly if \\( h(t) \\) is not uniquely invertible or distinctly characterized.",
