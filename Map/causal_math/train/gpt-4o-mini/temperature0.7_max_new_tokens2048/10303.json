  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Mx \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the matrix A to a new matrix \\\\( A' \\\\) at some point, and the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) was initially applied, will the final solution vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) directly depend only on \\\\( A' \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( M \\\\) and the subsequent modification to the matrix A compound their effects. Thus, the final state of the solution \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on both the original transformation \\\\( M \\\\) and the new matrix \\\\( A' \\\\), as they collectively define the evolution of the solution vector.",
