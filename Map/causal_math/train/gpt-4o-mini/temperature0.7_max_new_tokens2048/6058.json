  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time evolving according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) as real constants. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-st}z(\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) for a particular T, is it possible to uniquely determine whether the underlying cause was a change in \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without extra information about their initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation blends the effects of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) over time, and both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) influence their evolution. Without knowledge of their specific initial conditions or additional independent observations, it is not feasible to distinguish the effects of \\\\( k \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) based solely on \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\).",
