  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) evolving in time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined as \\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex \\( s \\), is analyzed.\n\nCan we deduce the exact original frequency \\( \\omega \\) by solely observing \\( T(z) \\) at different \\( s \\) values?",
  "Explanation": "Even though \\( T(z) \\) provides some information about the behavior of \\( z(t) \\), multiple \\( \\omega \\) values can result in similar transforms for different \\( s \\), especially without knowing the specifics of \\( z_0 \\) or without additional constraints on the relationship between \\( \\omega \\) and \\( s \\).",
