  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving in time according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. The system's evolution is further examined under an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Ps} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The integral transformation could have significantly altered the initial conditions in an untraceable manner depending on the characteristics of P.",
