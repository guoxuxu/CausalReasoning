  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\) with a given constant k. The influence of an external transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constants, is considered over time t.\n\nGiven the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at a later time T, is it possible to determine the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), it is unclear if the observed position at time T resulted from a natural evolution under \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\) or was influenced by the external transformation. This uncertainty in initial conditions makes it impossible to unequivocally trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
