  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. The system's behavior is further explored through the application of a transformation represented by \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention using a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention introduces a new transformation affecting the system's evolution. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thereby depends on the initial modification by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), the system's intrinsic frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and the intervention by \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), complicating the trajectory and dependency on all three parameters.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The behavior of the complex-valued function z(t) is directly influenced by the differential equation, where the rate of change of z, denoted as dot{z}, is governed by the real constant omega. The transformation f(z) causes changes in z over time, and similarly, the transformation g(z) also affects z after the intervention at time t1. Therefore, the endpoint z(T) is influenced by the transformations f(z) and g(z), as well as by the constant omega.",
