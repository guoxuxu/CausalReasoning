  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a complex exponential function. This function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is mapped through a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer. We explore the dynamics of this transformation over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applies a second transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state at any \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still only depend on the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the first transformation \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the second transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system, and hence the final state at any \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) will depend on both transformations \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), their specific order and their respective powers \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\).",
