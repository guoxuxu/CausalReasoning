  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = (K * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is a kernel representing a transformation and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(t) = e^{At}K(t) \\\\) where A is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce whether the original kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\) or the modified kernel \\\\( K'(t) \\\\) was used just by observing the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information on the nature of the input signal or the specifics of the constant A, it's challenging to uniquely determine which kernel was used based on the output alone. The transformation could produce similar effects for different types of inputs or A values.",
