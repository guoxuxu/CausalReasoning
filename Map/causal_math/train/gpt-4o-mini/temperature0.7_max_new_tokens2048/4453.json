  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We look at how the Laplace transform affects this function over the variable t, focusing on the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to the complex function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to evolve naturally with time under its original definition without further transformation, will the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be preserved?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) doesn't affect the time domain behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The effect of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is merely representational, translating the function into the s-domain without altering the original time function's evolution determined by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",
