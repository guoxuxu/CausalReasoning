  "Problem": "Examine a system where electric potential V is described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) within a region and manipulate the boundary conditions to observe causal effects. We're especially interested in how transformations such as conformal mappings can infer changes in electric field distributions.\n\nIf after a conformal mapping \\\\(f(z) = z^2\\\\), an external electric field of known configuration is introduced, will the altered distribution of \\\\(V\\\\) depend solely on the new boundary conditions and not on the specific form of \\\\(f\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final potential distribution \\\\(V\\\\) in the region will now be influenced by both the external field and the underlying domain shape altered by the mapping. Hence, both the new boundary conditions and the specific form of the transformation \\\\(f(z) = z^2\\\\) affect \\\\(V\\\\).",
