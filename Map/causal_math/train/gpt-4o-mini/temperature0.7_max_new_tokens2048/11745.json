  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model that describes the diffusion of a pollutant in a river, represented by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 c}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where c is the concentration of the pollutant and D is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nBy observing the spread of the pollutant at time T, can we determine the precise diffusion coefficient D at time t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Despite observing the dispersion pattern at time T, multiple values of the diffusion coefficient D could result in similar spread patterns depending on initial concentrations and other environmental factors. Therefore, D cannot be precisely determined from the effect without additional information.",
