  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t, satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's behavior using the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and without knowledge of c, can we deduce the original initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation constant c, there is insufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Multiple different initial conditions could lead to the same transformed output under different values of c, given that their influence scales linearly through the Laplace transform.",
