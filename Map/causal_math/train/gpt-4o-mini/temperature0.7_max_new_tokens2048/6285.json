  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to a frequency variable.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) is applied to the function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve governed by the transformed PDE, will \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for some T > 0 be the same as if \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) was evolved under the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear and invertible operation that, when applied to the PDE, changes the form but not the fundamental solution to the equation. The evolution in the transform space due to the transformed operator \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\) effectively captures the dynamics dictated by L. Transforming back to the original space after evolving preserves the original dynamics, thus the state at time T remains unchanged.",
