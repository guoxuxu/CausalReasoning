  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the behavior of the transformed function under a translation operation in the time domain, i.e., \\\\( g(t) = f(t-a) \\\\) with a positive a, represented by \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) = e^{-cs}F(s) \\\\), can we determine the exact time shifts applied (either \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), or both) only based on knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Just knowing \\\\( H(s) = e^{-cs}F(s) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to uniquely identify whether the transformation came from one shift of \\\\( c \\\\) units, or two shifts totaling to \\\\( c \\\\) (such as \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) where \\\\( a + b = c \\\\)). There are multiple combinations of shifts that could yield the same transformed result.",
