  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of a real variable, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this signal, represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we unambiguously determine the presence and exact form of any window function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) used during the transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by examining \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F(s) \\\\), after applying a window function, is a convolution that blends the characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Disentangling them from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone generally requires additional information about one of the functions to reverse the convolution effect unambiguously.",
