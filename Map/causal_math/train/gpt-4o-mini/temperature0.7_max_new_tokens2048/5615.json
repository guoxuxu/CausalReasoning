  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where t represents time. Consider further the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), defined for complex s where Re(s) > 0.\n\nIf we apply a damping factor e^{-\\alpha t} (where \\\\( \\\\alpha > 0 \\\\)) as an intervention on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), does this modification lead to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) having a pole only at s = -(i + \\\\alpha)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the damping factor transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( z(t) e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), shifting the pole of the resulting Laplace transform to s = i + \\\\alpha from s = i. However, there will still be essential singularities and behavior captured elsewhere in the complex plane depending on the values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and other properties of the function.",
