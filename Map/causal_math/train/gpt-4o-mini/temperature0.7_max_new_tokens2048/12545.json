  "Problem": "The system under study is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. The impact of an integral transformation represented by the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a kernel function, is analyzed.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\), it is unclear whether the observed state incorporates modification by the kernel \\\\(K\\\\). This uncertainty about the initial transformation makes it impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without additional data on the intervening transformation.",
