  "Problem": "Analyze the causal dynamics of a particle moving in a potential field given by \\( V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. The motion is subject to an external force \\( F(t) \\), and the differential equation governing the motion is \\( m\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{dV}{dx} + F(t) \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle.\n\nIf the external force \\( F(t) \\) is applied continuously from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\), will the position \\( x(T) \\) of the particle solely depend on the initial conditions and the nature of \\( F(t) \\) without the influence of \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The position \\( x(T) \\) is influenced by \\( k \\) through the potential field, as well as by the initial conditions and the external force \\( F(t) \\). The nature of \\( k \\) affects the restoring force \\( -kx \\) which interacts with \\( F(t) \\) in determining the motion of the particle.",
