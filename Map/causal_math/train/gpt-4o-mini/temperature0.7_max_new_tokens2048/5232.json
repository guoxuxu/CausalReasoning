  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) representing a complex valued function, where \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), and \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real valued functions governed by the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = A u \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = B v \\). We further study the transformation by the integral operator \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{C s} z(s) ds \\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the function \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) \\), \\( \\mathcal{S}(z) \\), or both) just by knowing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The possibility of different combinations of \\( e^{C s} \\) and \\( e^{D s} \\) affecting \\( z(t) \\) in various ways means multiple scenarios could lead to the same \\( z(T) \\). The overlap and variability in the effects of these transformations make it infeasible to uniquely reconstruct the history of interventions.",
