  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex number representing an initial value in the complex plane. This scenario deals with the evolution of the complex function over time and explores the possible effects of external complex transformations.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{i \\theta t} \\\\) was applied at some point, only based on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional data about time intervals or \\\\( \\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different paths involving varying applications or non-applications of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or different values of \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and intervals. Without explicit knowledge of these factors, it's impossible to confirm the specific intervention based solely on \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
