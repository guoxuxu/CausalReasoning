  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined over the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{aw^2 + bw} dw \\\\) where a and b are constants. We are interested in the causal influence of changes in parameters a and b, or transformations on w, on the resulting function values computed by z.\n\nHaving observed a specific output from z(w) at time T, can we deduce the exact values of a and b at t = 0, assuming no intervention has been made in the parameter setting?",
  "Explanation": "The integral yielding z(w) is influenced by both a and b, creating a functional dependency on these parameters that cannot be uniquely inverted without additional constraints or data. The complex nature of the exponential function with squared terms inside an integral makes it difficult to uniquely determine a and b.",
