  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional space where we deal with the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace Transform. We analyze the causality and effect relations within signals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and their Laplace Transforms \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the transformed output \\\\( X_{new}(s) \\\\) from the previous case, is it possible to determine both the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the exact filtering function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "This results in an undetermined problem where multiple pairs of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could theoretically produce the same \\\\( X_{new}(s) \\\\). Without additional constraints or information about either the signal or the filter, it is not feasible to uniquely resolve both.",
