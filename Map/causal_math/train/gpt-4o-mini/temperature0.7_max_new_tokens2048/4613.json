  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). We investigate how modifying the original function impacts its Laplace transform, and vice versa, particularly focusing on an exponential function applied as \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( e^{-at}f(t) \\\\) and we perform the Laplace transform, will the result \\\\( G(s) \\\\) for any \\\\( s \\\\) be effectively equivalent to a translation of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\) on the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\) results in the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{-at}f(t))(s) = F(s+a) \\\\). This is essentially an s-domain translation of the function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\), directly attributable to the multiplication of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with the exponential decay term.",
