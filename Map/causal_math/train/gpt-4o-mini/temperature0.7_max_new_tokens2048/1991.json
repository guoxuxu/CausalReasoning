  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf at a certain later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation matrix \\\\( N \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant function form at t = T depend solely on the initial matrix \\\\( M \\\\) applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new transformation matrix \\\\( N \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another level of modification. This makes the function form at time T dependent on both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), as the combined effect of both transformations will dictate the resultant function's characteristics.",
