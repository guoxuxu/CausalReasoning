  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = My\\\\), and M is a constant matrix. We study the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt}y \\\\) applied at different instances, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine unambiguously which transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(y) \\\\), \\\\( k(y) \\\\), or both) just by analyzing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were applied on \\\\( y \\\\) based solely on the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complicated due to the non-commutativity of the exponential operations associated with D and F matrices. Different combinations of these transformations could potentially yield the same end state, therefore making it inherently ambiguous.",
