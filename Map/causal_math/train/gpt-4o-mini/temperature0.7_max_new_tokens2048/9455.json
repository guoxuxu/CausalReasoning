  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We look into how the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a real constant, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (with C being another real constant) is applied at a specific time t1 as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 only depend on the initial condition and A, not B or C?",
  "Explanation": "With the interventions using \\\\( k(z) \\\\), the final state at T is influenced by the sequence of phase shifts due to B initially and C at t1. Both constants alter the trajectory of the original system defined by A, hence the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, and C.",
