  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) applied in a calculus context on a closed contour \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of various transformations and integrations of the function over the contour.\n\nIf we integrate \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over the contour \\\\( C \\\\) without any deformations of the contour, will the integral value be the same as if we directly computed the integral of \\\\( e^z \\\\) over \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) by definition, the integral of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over \\\\( C \\\\) remains unchanged and is directly equivalent to the integral of \\\\( e^z \\\\) over the same contour. There are no modifications to the function or the contour, so they yield the same result.",
