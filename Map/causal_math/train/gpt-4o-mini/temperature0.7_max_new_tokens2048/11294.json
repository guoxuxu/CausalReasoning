  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Suppose we apply the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) periodically at times \\\\(t_n = nT\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is an integer and \\\\(T\\\\) a constant interval.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) affecting the initial state introduces an unknown scaling factor. Without this knowledge, recovering the exact initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is ambiguous because the scaling alters the magnitude and could rotate the phase of the complex number.",
