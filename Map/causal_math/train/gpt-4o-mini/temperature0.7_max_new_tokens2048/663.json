  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nIf an intervention applying a different matrix \\\\( N \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is introduced, will the format and properties of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( N \\\\) can change the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting both the magnitude and the phase of the complex exponential. The result at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends critically on both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), in addition to the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Different combinations of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) can markedly alter the final observed state.",
