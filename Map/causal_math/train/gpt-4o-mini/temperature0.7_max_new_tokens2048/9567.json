  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We will study the changes in the function with respect to the integration operator over time defined as \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), and analyze the influence of modifications by derivative with respect to time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an operation defined by \\\\( g(t) = z'(t) \\\\) (derivative of z with respect to t) is used as an intervention, will \\\\( F(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original function z without consideration of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the derivative operation as an intervention partway through the interval modifies the value of the function thereafter, changing the integrand from \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) to \\\\( i \\\\omega e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\). This change affects the remaining integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, thus altering \\\\( F(T) \\\\) in a way that directly involves the intervention.",
