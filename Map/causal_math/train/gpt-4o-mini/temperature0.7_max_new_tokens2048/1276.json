  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{tA}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( g(t, x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sB}x \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix, applied at time zero.\n\nGiven the final state at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to determine whether just \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), just \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\), or both were applied over the course of evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at time \\\\( T \\\\) might result from different transformations involving matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) in several configurations because both matrices can influence the system's evolution in a nontrivial and potentially overlapping manner. This makes it challenging to uniquely attribute the final state to specific transformations without additional context or data.",
