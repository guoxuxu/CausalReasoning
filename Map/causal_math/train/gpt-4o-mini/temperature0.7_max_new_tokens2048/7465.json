  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function is subjected to a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under the differential equations without further intervention, will the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if transformations on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( y(t) \\\\) were not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Allowing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without intervention changes the forms of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\), impacting the result of the Fourier Transform at any frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), due to the differential impact of A and B on their respective functions.",
