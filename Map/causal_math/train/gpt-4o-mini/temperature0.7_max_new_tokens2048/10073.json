  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistance R in series with an inductance L and a varying voltage source V(t). The voltage and current relationship is given by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI\\\\), where I is the current through the circuit.\n\nIf the voltage source V(t) is switched from \\\\(V_0\\\\) to \\\\(V_1\\\\) at time t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the given circuit laws without further intervention, will the current I(t) at t = T be the same as if V(t) remained constant at \\\\(V_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the voltage source from \\\\(V_0\\\\) to \\\\(V_1\\\\) alters the initial driving force of the circuit, affecting the rate of change of current and subsequently the overall current I(t) at any time T. This change is determined by the circuit's differential equation, clearly indicating a dependency on the change in voltage.",
