  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), known as the wave equation. We explore the influence of a Fourier transform applied initially (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\)) and how it impacts the propagation of the wave over time.\n\nFrom the wave profile at time T, can we uniquely reconstruct the original wave profile \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of the Fourier transform, it is not possible to accurately reconstruct \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\). The transformation could significantly alter the initial frequency characteristics, and some information about the phase and amplitude could be irreversibly modulated by the dynamics of the wave equation.",
