  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the particle movement on a plane is determined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts of the particle's position at time t, respectively. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is used to analyze the frequency components of the motion.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, will the resultant spectrum \\\\( F'(\\\\omega) \\\\) still reflect only the original frequencies inherent in \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modulates the original function with a frequency \\\\( w \\\\), resulting in a frequency shift in the Fourier spectrum. Thus, the resultant spectrum \\\\( F'(\\\\omega) \\\\) will include unexpected shifts, reflecting the effect of the modulation.",
