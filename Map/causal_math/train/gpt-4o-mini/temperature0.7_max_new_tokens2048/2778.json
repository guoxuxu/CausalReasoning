  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) on the complex plane, and we are studying its transformation through a complex contour integral \\\\(I(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u(z) dz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple, closed contour and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\(I(t)\\\\) for some fixed \\\\(t\\\\), can we uniquely determine the original power \\\\(k\\\\) in \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) without knowing any other contextual information?",
  "Explanation": "Simply knowing the result of \\\\(I(t)\\\\) is not sufficient to accurately pinpoint \\\\(k\\\\), as various factors including the path of integration and the complex nature of the exponents can result in similar outcomes for different values of \\\\(k\\\\).",
