  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) on a bounded domain with initial displacement given by \\\\(u(x,0) = f(x)\\\\) and a Fourier transform applied to the displacement as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x)dx\\\\). We consider how interventions via changes in boundary conditions or initial conditions affect the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\(f(x)\\\\) that undergoes a Fourier transform is left to evolve according to the wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) without further intervention, will the developed wave form \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at some later time t purely be determined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution of the wave equation over time can be completely described by the transformed initial conditions due to the linearity and translational invariance of the wave equation. The propagation is fully characterized by how the initial transformed states \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0)\\\\) evolve over time, given by \\\\(u(x,t) = \\\\int e^{ikx} \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\cos(ctk) dk\\\\).",
