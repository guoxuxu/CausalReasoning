  "Problem": "Consider a linear canonical transformation system governed by complex function integration \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} w(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and w(t) represents an external input function. We explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( h(w) = \\\\int e^{Bt} w(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can the original input function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) be precisely recovered knowing that either \\\\( w(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied, but not which?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of an unknown transformation applied to the input function complicates backward calculations. Without explicit knowledge of whether \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied, recovering \\\\( w(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) uniquely is not feasible due to the integral transformation potentially modifying the original temporal characteristics of \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
