  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( z \\\\) a complex number. A Fourier transform transformation \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the transformed function, making it \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We will explore the implications of modifying the power \\\\( n \\\\) and the transformation's effect on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nObserving a narrower peak in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we infer that \\\\( n \\\\) was increased?",
  "Explanation": "A narrower peak in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) suggests that the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was spread wider in the time domain, which is a characteristic effect of increasing the power \\\\( n \\\\) in \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\).",
