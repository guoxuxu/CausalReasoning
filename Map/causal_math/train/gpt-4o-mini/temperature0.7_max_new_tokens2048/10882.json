  "Problem": "Consider the relationship governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), representing the unit circle in the complex plane. Study the behavior of the system when a transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied.\n\nAfter observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T under \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), can we determine if \\( f(z) \\) was applied at t = 0 to transform the original point?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without prior knowledge of the application of \\( f(z) \\) doesn't provide enough information to conclusively tell if the initial point was squared, as the same point \\( e^{iT} \\) could result from different initial conditions in the domain of \\( f(z) \\).",
