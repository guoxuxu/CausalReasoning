  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\) governing the temperature field \\( u \\) over a domain, affected by an external heat source modulated by the function \\( h(t, x) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\sin(\\omega x) \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\omega \\) are constants.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\( u(x, T) \\) at some time \\( T \\), can one determine uniquely whether the external source \\( h(t, x) \\) was applied from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting temperature profile \\( u(x, T) \\) may resemble one achieved through different heat distributions or initial conditions, compounded by transient heat dynamics and diffusion processes. Without explicit knowledge of the boundary and initial conditions, as well as the specifics of any external influences like \\( h(t, x) \\), reconstructing the exact cause strictly from \\( u(x, T) \\) is not feasible.",
