  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time t is modeled by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of applying a time-dependent heat source \\( S(x,t) = h(t) \\cdot \\cos(\\omega x) \\) along the rod.\n\nIf at a certain time t = 5, an intervention modifies the heat equation to \\( u_t = k' u_{xx} \\) (where k' is a different thermal diffusivity), will the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\) for T = 10 depend only on the original k and not on k' or \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the thermal diffusivity at t = 5, which alters the rate of heat diffusion. Thus, the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\) at T = 10 will depend on both the original function \\( h(t) \\), the original thermal diffusivity k, and the modified diffusivity k', affecting the overall temperature distribution.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The thermal diffusivity constant k affects the temperature change over time u_t, while the spatial second derivative of temperature u_{xx} also influences u_t. The time-dependent heat source h(t) modifies the heat source S(x,t), which in turn impacts u_t. If the thermal diffusivity is changed to k', it similarly affects u_t. Ultimately, u_t influences the temperature at the endpoint u(x,T).",
