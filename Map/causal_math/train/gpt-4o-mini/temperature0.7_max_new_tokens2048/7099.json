  "Problem": "Analyze the implications of applying a Fourier transform to a signal and then filtering with a kernel represented by H(s), an analytic function in the complex frequency domain, on the properties of the signal.\n\nIf a signal is first Fourier transformed, then a time-varying filter H(t, s) (where H is now a function of both time and frequency) is applied, and the signal is inverse transformed back to the time domain, will this process not vary the original signal's time-domain characteristics?",
  "Explanation": "The use of a time-varying filter H(t, s) adds additional complexity, causing variations in the signal's frequency domain that depend dynamically on time. This transformation inevitably modifies the signal's time-domain characteristics, including potential changes in local time behaviors such as transient responses and steady-state amplitude.",
