  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. This transformation applies to a signal analysis context where the function represents a wave. Suppose we apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) at some point.\n\nFrom the observed spectrum at time T, can we determine the presence and specific nature (exact \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\)) of a phase shift intervention after the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the phase of the signal deviates from what is expected purely from \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), it is indicative of an intervention. By analyzing the phase differences in the spectrum, the specific nature of the phase shift (i.e., the value of \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\)) can accurately be deduced from the extent of deviation.",
