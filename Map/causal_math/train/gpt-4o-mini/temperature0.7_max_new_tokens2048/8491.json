  "Problem": "Assume that a function \\\\( h: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) is defined as \\\\( h(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We investigate the effects of this transformation on complex-valued functions and their corresponding Fourier Transforms.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( a \\\\) to a new value \\\\( b \\\\) at some point after \\\\( f(z) = e^{az}g(z) \\\\) was initially transformed, and then the Fourier Transform is recalculated, will the outcome only depend on the new value \\\\( b \\\\), not on \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) does not erase the effects of the initial application of \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The outcome in the Fourier domain will reflect a combined influence of both the original transformation by \\\\( a \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( b \\\\), creating composite effects.",
