  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) applied to a linear system characterized by \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where \\( D \\) is a constant matrix and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number. The system's evolution is influenced by the Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\), which transforms \\( x(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf at a certain time F, a new function \\( h(x) = e^{j\\eta t}x \\) (where \\( j \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( \\eta \\) a constant) intervenes, does the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) at \\( T > F \\) display a shift depending only on \\( \\eta \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\eta \\) contribute to the frequency shift observed in \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\). The intervention with \\( h(x) \\) adds an additional frequency component at \\( \\eta \\), influencing the total frequency distribution in combination with the initial effect of \\( \\omega \\) from \\( z(t) \\). Thus, the resultant spectrum is shaped by the interactions of both transformations.",
