  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the impact of the linear transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to correctly backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the initial transformation by \\\\( C \\\\) could have changed the magnitude and phase in ways that are not discernible merely from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially without knowing C.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) is determined by the differential equation, which indicates that z(t) directly influences the original vector z_0 at t = 0. The transformation f(z) depends on the constant matrix C, indicating that C influences the transformation f(z) applied to z(t). Additionally, z(t) can be influenced by ω, which affects the evolution of z(t).",
