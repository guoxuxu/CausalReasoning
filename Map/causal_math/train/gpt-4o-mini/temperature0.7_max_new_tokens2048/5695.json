  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subject to a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. We also consider the effect of an integral transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ks} z(s) ds \\\\) over a time interval [0,T], where K is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf we apply the integral transform \\\\( h(z) \\\\) during the interval [0, T], is the resulting transformed state \\\\( h(z) \\\\) determined independently of the original matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral transform \\\\( h(z) \\\\) depends on the entire function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval [0, T], which in turn is determined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\). Since the integral includes \\\\( e^{Ks} z(s) \\\\), which itself depends on \\\\( e^{Ms} z(0) \\\\), the output of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is determined by both K and M, not independently of M.",
