  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the impact of the linear transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) results in a compounded transformation of the initial state. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depends on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\), reflecting the cumulative effect of these transformations on both the magnitude and phase of the vector.",
