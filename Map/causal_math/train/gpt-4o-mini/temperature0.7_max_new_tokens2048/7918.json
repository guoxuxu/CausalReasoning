  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), respectively, with constants a and b. Analyze the behavior of the function after applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be determined after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If unaware of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the rotational effect imposed by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) cannot be discerned from changes due solely to the original differential equations. Without this knowledge, recovering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) leads to ambiguity between multiple potential initial conditions.",
