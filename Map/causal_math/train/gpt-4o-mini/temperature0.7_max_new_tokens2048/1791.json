  "Problem": "Analyze a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) is considered as an intervention on the system, with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), the system undergoes an intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) applied, will the output at \\\\( z = T \\\\) for \\\\( T > z_1 \\\\) solely depend on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces external influence via matrix \\\\( B \\\\). Thus, the system's state at \\\\( T \\\\) becomes a function of both matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), influenced by the compounding effects of two exponential transformations.",
