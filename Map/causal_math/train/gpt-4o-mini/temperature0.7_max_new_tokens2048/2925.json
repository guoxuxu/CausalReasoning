  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t=0 and is then allowed to evolve according to the complex function definition without any further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t=T be different from the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) affects the evolution of the function over time. Initially, \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), but after applying the transformation and continuing without intervention, the transformation accumulates the effect of the integral of \\\\( e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\\\), which alters the result from the simply evolving \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\).",
