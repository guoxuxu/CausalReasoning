  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} = Ku\\\\) with a constant coefficient K. Analyze the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(u) = Cu \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied to the initial condition.\n\nIf \\\\( h(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} = Ku\\\\) without further intervention, will the state vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the state obtained by directly evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) to t = T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Cu_0 \\\\). The solution to the differential equation with this new initial condition is \\\\( u(t) = e^{Kt}(Cu_0) \\\\), which generally differs from \\\\( e^{Kt}u_0 \\\\) unless C commutes with \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\), affecting the state trajectory over time.",
