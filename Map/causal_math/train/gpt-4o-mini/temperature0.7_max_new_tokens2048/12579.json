  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The influence of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, is analyzed over time. This transformation modifies the trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the specific transformations (\\\\( L \\\\) and/or \\\\( M \\\\)) that were applied by observing the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome observed at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of parameters and transformations, especially due to the complexity of overlapping effects in the complex plane. Different parameter values for \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( d \\\\) could lead to similar end states, making it infeasible to pinpoint the exact transformations used without additional data.",
