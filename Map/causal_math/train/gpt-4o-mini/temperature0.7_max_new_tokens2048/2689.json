  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a closed container, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity constant. We investigate the effect of a spatial transformation \\\\( u' = T(u) \\\\) where \\\\( T \\\\) is a rotation matrix.\n\nIf the initial velocity field \\\\( u_0 \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) at time t = 0, and subsequent evolution follows the given fluid dynamics without further intervention, will the state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under standard fluid dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The rotation matrix \\\\( T \\\\) changes the initial orientation of the velocity field. This alteration modifies the directional properties and therefore the trajectory of the flow under the non-linear term \\\\( (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T.",
