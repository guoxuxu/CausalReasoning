  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is an input vector. The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) also being constant matrices.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether the function \\\\( Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The unknown application of \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\) introduces ambiguity in tracing back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The influence of \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) on the initial conditions might not be reversible just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially without knowing the specifics of \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( A \\\\), and \\\\( B \\\\).",
