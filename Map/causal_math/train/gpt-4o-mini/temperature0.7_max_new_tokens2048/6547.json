  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator to produce an output \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf the kernel is altered at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to a new kernel \\\\( k'(t, s) \\\\), will the output at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be independent of previous kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output at any time point depends on both the input signal and the kernel applied up to that time. Changes to the kernel at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) do not negate the effects of the original kernel on the signal processed before \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the resulting output will reflect the cumulative effect of both kernels applied over time.",
