  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. The function transforms using a Fourier Transform, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) is calculated for \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) without any modifications to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), will the transformed function have a delta function at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) directly results in a delta function centered at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). This is due to the property of the Fourier Transform which maps purely oscillatory components to precise frequencies.",
