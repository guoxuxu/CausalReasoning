  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz + u \\\\) with \\\\( u \\\\) being a control function and \\\\( D \\\\) a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nKnowing the outcome of the Laplace transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a specific value of \\\\( s \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing \\\\( u(t) \\\\)'s form?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\\\( u \\\\), which directly affects the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\), implies that multiple combinations of initial conditions and forms of \\\\( u \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Therefore, without explicit knowledge of \\\\( u(t) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely back-calculate the initial state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
