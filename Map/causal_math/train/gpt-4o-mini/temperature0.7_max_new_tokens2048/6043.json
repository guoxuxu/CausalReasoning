  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented in matrix form \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. The system is transformed by performing a Laplace transform which alters the system to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) denotes the Laplace transform, and s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf a correction matrix C is introduced, modifying the original system to \\\\(A'x = Ax + Cx = b\\\\), and afterwards a Laplace transformation is applied, does \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A') * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix C modifies A to A', but assuming C is a matrix that properly conforms with operations on A and suitable roll-up transformations, the resulting system post Laplace transform should still match the transformed b, given that all transformations are linear and operations correctly applied.",
