  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant coefficients. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system over time t, where C is a complex constant.\n\nWould the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolving it under the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without any further changes result in the same endpoint as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) alters the initial state, and thus modifies how the state evolves. Given that C influences the growth or decay of the real and imaginary components differently than A and B alone, the final state will differ.",
