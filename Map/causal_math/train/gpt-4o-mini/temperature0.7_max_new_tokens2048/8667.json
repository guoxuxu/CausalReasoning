  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where the initial condition is \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). We explore transformations using the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function operation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} \\\\cos(s) z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, will the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original system dynamics and not by the initial transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) imposes another layer of transformation, altering the exact path and behaviour of the function beyond the initial transformation and system's natural dynamics. Thus, the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be shaped by the original transformation, the system dynamics, and this subsequent intervention.",
