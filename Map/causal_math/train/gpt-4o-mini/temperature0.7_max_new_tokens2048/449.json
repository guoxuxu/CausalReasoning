  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( F(z_1, z_2) \\\\) where \\\\( z_1, z_2 \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of different contour deformations in the complex plane when computing the contour integral of \\\\( F \\\\).\n\nIf we deform the contour of integration from a circle to an ellipse without changing the endpoints or enclosing any poles, does the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int F(z_1, z_2) dz \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "According to Cauchy's theorem, as long as the deformation of the contour does not cross or enclose any new poles or singular points of the function \\\\( F \\\\), the value of the integral remains unchanged. This is because the integral of a holomorphic function over a closed contour depends only on the poles enclosed by the contour and not on the shape of the contour itself.",
