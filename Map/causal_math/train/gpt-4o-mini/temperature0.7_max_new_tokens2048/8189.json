  "Problem": "We study a vector field \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by two processes: multiplication by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iwt}z \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) applied over time. We aim to understand how these transformations impact \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally, will applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) yield the same result as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had simply undergone the Fourier transform at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex multiplication by \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) changes the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which significantly alters the result of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is sensitive to changes in phase and, as such, the outcome will differ.",
