  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces out a unit circle in the complex plane over time. Analyze the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) follows \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) initially without transformations from 0 to T, will the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) applied at time T yield the same result as directly calculating \\\\( T(z) \\\\) from 0 to T without altering the function?",
  "Explanation": "Since no modification is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the integral transformation will directly compute the area under the curve of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which effectively traces the integral of a circular motion, generating the same result irrespective of any structural changes since none occurred.",
