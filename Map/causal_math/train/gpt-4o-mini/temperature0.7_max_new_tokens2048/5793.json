  "Problem": "Suppose there is a function \\\\(z(x, t)\\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + x \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) where x represents space and t represents time. An intervention \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is defined as \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x, t) + v(x, t)\\\\), with \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) being solutions to another set of PDEs.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(z(x, 0) = u(x, 0) + v(x, 0)\\\\) is given, and the function evolves over time according to the specified PDE without added interventions, will the outcome at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) solely depend on the initial conditions set by \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, 0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the linear PDE depends directly on the initial conditions, and since no additional terms or interventions modify these conditions, the output at any time \\\\(t = T\\\\) can be predicted solely based on the initial values provided by \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, 0)\\\\).",
