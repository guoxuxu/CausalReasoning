  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the influence of a Fourier transform on this function as an intervention.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that a Fourier transform was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we infer whether the system evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the intervention of a Fourier transform, the characteristics and influence of the original differential dynamics (\\\\( i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\)) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are still manifest in the state's evolution before \\\\( t_1 \\\\). This prior trajectory can be deduced by analyzing the pre-intervention segment of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
