  "Problem": "We consider an electrical system modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), representing the impedance as a function of complex frequency \\\\( s \\\\). An intervention is applied by modifying the system impedance through an additional component described as \\\\( H(s) = e^{-st}Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nKnowing the impedance at a later time and given \\\\( s = j\\\\omega \\\\), can we determine whether the system started with \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) or \\\\( H(s) \\\\) without knowing the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The effect observed at a later time, represented by some \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( s = j\\\\omega \\\\), might have been influenced by the exponential transformation \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\). Without the knowledge of whether or not \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was applied, the original state \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) cannot be uniquely inferred due to the possible alteration by \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\).",
