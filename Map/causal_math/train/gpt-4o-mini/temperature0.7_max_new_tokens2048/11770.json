  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. The function is initially transformed by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t} u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\mu t} u \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is a constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) adds another exponential modifying factor to the system dynamics. As a result, the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is influenced by both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) along with the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\). The transformations due to \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\mu t} \\\\) can independently and collectively alter how the temperature evolves, affecting the final state at T.",
