  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. This function is subjected to an integral transform, specifically a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform of a function is known to be \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - w) \\\\), can we infer that the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a single Dirac delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = w \\\\) in the Fourier transform indicates the original function was purely sinusoidal at the frequency \\\\( w \\\\), effectively characterizing it as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\).",
