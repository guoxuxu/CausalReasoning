  "Problem": "Let's examine the role of a control function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in determining the solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + x\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(x, T) = \\\\sin(x - T)\\\\) at time T, is it possible to uniquely determine that the initial condition was \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(x)\\\\) without knowing how the equation was solved?",
  "Explanation": "Based on the backward characteristic of the equation and the linear nature of the drift terms, seeing \\\\(u(x, T) = \\\\sin(x - T)\\\\) uniquely allows us to compute backward to find \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(x)\\\\), even without explicit knowledge of the intermediate solving process.",
