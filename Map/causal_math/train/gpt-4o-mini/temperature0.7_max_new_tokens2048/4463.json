  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) driven by a pair of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant scalar.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (with D a constant scalar) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the subsequent state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the initial equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a substantial modification to the trajectory by scaling the state vector \\\\( z(t_1) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), thus affecting the resultant path. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, C (from the initial transformation), and D (from the intervention), indicating a cumulative effect from these scaling operations.",
