  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) =  x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a signal's components in time. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed into the frequency domain using a Fourier transform, and then \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is left unmodified, can we expect the inverse Fourier transform to reproduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is linear and invertible under suitable conditions (like integrability and smoothness of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)). Assuming no modifications in the frequency domain, the inverse transform of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) should yield the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
