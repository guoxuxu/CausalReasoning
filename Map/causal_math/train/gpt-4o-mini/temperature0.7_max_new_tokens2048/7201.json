  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We will explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with A being a real constant, influences the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nIf we transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0 and allow it to evolve naturally without further transformations, will the resultant complex function at any time T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly processed for the same duration without \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) integrates the effect of \\\\( e^{sA}z(s) \\\\) from 0 to T, changing the dynamics from the original \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). This modification fundamentally alters the trajectory, resulting in a distinct function at any time T compared to the unaltered evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
