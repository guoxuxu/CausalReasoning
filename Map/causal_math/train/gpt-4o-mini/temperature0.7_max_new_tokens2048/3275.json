  "Problem": "Consider the operation of convolution on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) with a system impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) producing the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\). We explore the causality implications of this convolution under a transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * F(t) \\\\) where \\\\( F(t) \\\\) is another kernel function.\n\nIf an intervention is done by modifying the kernel \\\\( F(t) \\\\) at some point during the convolution process, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without being affected by the original or modified \\\\( F(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering \\\\( F(t) \\\\) during the convolution changes the input's structure therefore affecting the outcome. The intervention influences the final \\\\( y(t) \\\\) by transforming the intermediate or final stages of convolution, making it dependent on both the nature of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the kernel function \\\\( F(t) \\\\).",
