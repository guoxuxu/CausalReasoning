  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the temperature \\( T \\) of a substance is related to its electrical resistance \\( R \\) through the equation \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( R_0 \\) are constants. An additional thermal experiment involves the application of a function \\( g(T) = T + \\Delta T \\), where \\( \\Delta T \\) is a constant temperature change.\n\nIf \\( g(T) \\) is applied resulting in a new temperature \\( T + \\Delta T \\) at time \\( t \\), will the resistance \\( R(T + \\Delta T) \\) at \\( T \\) depend only on \\( a \\), not on \\( \\Delta T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(T) \\) modifies the temperature by adding \\( \\Delta T \\), thereby changing the course of the resistance evolution to \\( R(T + \\Delta T) = R_0 e^{a(T + \\Delta T)} \\). Consequently, the final resistance value is influenced by both \\( a \\) and \\( \\Delta T \\), signifying a dependency beyond just \\( a \\).",
