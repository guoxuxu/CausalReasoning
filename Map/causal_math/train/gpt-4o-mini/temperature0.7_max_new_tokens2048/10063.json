  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation, simplified to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\nu\\\\nabla^2u\\\\), where u is the velocity field, p is pressure, and ν is viscosity. Evaluate the behavior under a Fourier transform of the velocity field, represented as \\\\( F(u)(k) \\\\), where k is the wave number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filter function \\\\( G(u) = H(k-k_0)u \\\\) (where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Heaviside function and \\\\( k_0 \\\\) a specific wave number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on initial parameters and not on \\\\( k_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) introduces a filtering based on wave number which modifies the spectrum of the velocity field. Thus, the final state \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) will depend on the initial conditions, the Navier-Stokes dynamics, and critically on the wave number \\\\( k_0 \\\\) due to the selective filtering of certain frequencies.",
