  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nIf an additional operator M, such that \\( Mu = e^{Ax}u \\) where A is a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at time t_1, will the ultimate form of \\( u(T) \\), for T > t_1, depend only on the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a new operator M as an intervention introduces exponential growth terms determined by A along with the differential properties of L, configuring both growth and diffusion components into \\( u(T) \\). Thus, the outcome at T > t_1 now reflects the interplay and combined effect of L and M.",
