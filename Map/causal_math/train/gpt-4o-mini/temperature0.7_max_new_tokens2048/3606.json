  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be determined after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\alpha t} \\\\) could have scaled \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in various ways depending on its value, affecting the amplitude and phase of the trajectory. Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
