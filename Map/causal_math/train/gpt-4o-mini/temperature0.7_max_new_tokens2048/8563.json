  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a given contour in the complex plane and z is a complex variable. We explore the effect of the contour shift defined by \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) which results from the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t + i \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf at a particular parameter \\\\( z_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\Gamma(iz)z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) is the Gamma function) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting \\\\( F(z) \\\\) for some \\\\( z \\\\neq z_1 \\\\) depend only on the original contour \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) and not on \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces significant functional alterations to the outcome. As \\\\( \\\\Gamma(iz)z \\\\) affects the evaluation of the exponential part of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) through its impact on z, combined with the contour shift introduced by \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the final functional form of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) depends on all these factors.",
