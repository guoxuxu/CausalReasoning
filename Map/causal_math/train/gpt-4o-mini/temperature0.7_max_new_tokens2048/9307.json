  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system's state over time t. An integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) characterized by the kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\) is applied, influencing the evolution according to the formula \\\\(Tz(t) = \\\\int K(s, t) z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nSuppose a modification is introduced at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) in the form of a second transformation \\\\(U\\\\) with a different kernel \\\\(M(s, t)\\\\). Will the final state of the function at time \\\\(T\\\\) be influenced solely by the original kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\) without the impact of \\\\(M(s, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a second transformation \\\\(U\\\\) modifies the trajectory of the function by applying a new kernel \\\\(M(s, t)\\\\) that interacts with and alters the evolution guided by the original kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\). The final state is therefore a result of both kernels' influences on the function, not merely the original one.",
