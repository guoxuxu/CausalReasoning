  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network governed by the Laplace Transform of a complex function \\(\\overline{V}(s) = H(s)\\overline{I}(s)\\), where \\(H(s)\\) represents the system's transfer function and \\(\\overline{V}(s)\\) and \\(\\overline{I}(s)\\) are the Laplace transforms of the voltage and current, respectively. Suppose a filter with a specific impulse response \\( g(t) \\) characterized by its transfer function \\( G(s) \\) is introduced into the network.\n\nIf the network operates under a given input current \\( \\overline{I}(s) \\) without any filters, and later, \\( G(s) \\) is applied but removed before time t = T, does \\( \\overline{V}(T) \\) remain solely influenced by \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( G(s) \\) is applied and removed before the assessment of \\( \\overline{V}(T) \\), the voltage at T depends only on \\( H(s) \\) as it determines how the system inherently responds to \\( \\overline{I}(s) \\), given that \\( G(s) \\)'s effects would have nullified by its removal.",
