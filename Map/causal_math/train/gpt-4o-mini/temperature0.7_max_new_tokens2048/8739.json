  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and solve the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), with constants a and b. We investigate how transformations like \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) affect this system, where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the system constants a and b, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the trajectory of the system again. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will now depend on all constants a, b, C, and D, since these transformations affect both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\), influencing the system's evolution in a compounded manner.",
