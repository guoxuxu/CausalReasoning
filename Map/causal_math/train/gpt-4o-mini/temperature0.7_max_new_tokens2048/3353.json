  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where a and b are complex constants. We analyze how the mapping under this function and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\), where c and d are also complex constants, affect outcomes.\n\nIf a complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then evolves naturally under its own dynamics without further transformations, does the outcome at time T depend solely on the parameters a and b?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional interventions, the state at any time T will solely depend on the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and hence only on the parameters a and b. The complex dynamics post-\\\\( f(z) \\\\) application will trace a trajectory dependent on these parameters.",
