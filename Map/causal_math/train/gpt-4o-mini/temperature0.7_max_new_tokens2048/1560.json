  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function transformation on a real function g(x) over the domain [0, 1]. The transformation is defined by T(g)(x) = ∫_0^1 e^(iπsx) g(s) ds, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the resultant function at x = 1 after transformations T and U, can one determine precisely which transformations (T or U or both) were applied, based solely on the output at x = 1?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether T, U, or both were applied based on the output at x = 1 is inherently complex due to the integral and exponential nature of both transformations. Both can influence the resultant value in overlapping ways, making discrete identification based solely on final output challenging.",
