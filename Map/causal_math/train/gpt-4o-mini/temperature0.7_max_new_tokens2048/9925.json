  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Let's analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number with positive real part.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any additional modifications, will the outcome \\\\(T[z(t)]\\\\) solely be dependent on the initial function form initiated by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) results in \\\\(\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-(s-i\\\\omega)t} dt\\\\), which simplifies directly to \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega}\\\\). The outcome is dependent only on the parameters \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(s\\\\) starting from the original form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any external modification.",
