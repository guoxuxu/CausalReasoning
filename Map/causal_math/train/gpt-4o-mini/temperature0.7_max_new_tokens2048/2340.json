  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation where a signal x(t) is first converted to X(s) using the Laplace transformation. The transformed signal X(s) is then modified by a multiplicative function H(s), which acts as a system's transfer function. Finally, the modified signal Y(s) = H(s)X(s) is converted back to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transformation to yield y(t).\n\nGiven the final output z(t) from the augmented system (involving G(s)), can we uniquely determine the original x(t) given knowledge of both H(s) and G(s)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of H(s) and G(s), the reverse calculation from Z(s) to X(s) can be complicated by issues like non-invertibility or non-unique solutions, especially if H(s)G(s) does not cover the entire s-domain or introduces singularities. Multiple potential x(t) could give rise to the same Z(s) via different intermediate X(s).",
