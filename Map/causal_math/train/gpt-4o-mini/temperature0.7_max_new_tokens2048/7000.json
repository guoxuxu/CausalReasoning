  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces out a unit circle in the complex plane over time. Analyze the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nCan the precise sequence of functional changes (\\\\( e^{it} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{-it} \\\\)) be identified by analyzing the endpoint result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The final result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), which is the integral from 0 to T, might not distinctly reveal the exact points or nature of functional changes unless additional information about transition points or system dynamics is available. The transformation's output often encapsulates cumulative effects that mask individual alterations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
