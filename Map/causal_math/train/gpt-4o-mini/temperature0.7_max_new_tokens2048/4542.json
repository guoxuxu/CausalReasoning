  "Problem": "Let’s analyze a complex dynamic system governed by a Cauchy problem involving Fourier transforms, defined by \\\\( u'(t) = A \\\\cdot \\mathcal{F}(u(t)) + B \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a function of time t, \\\\( A \\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely identify the initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing the parameters \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) uniquely from the state at \\\\( u(T) \\\\) relies on knowing how the system evolves, which is critically dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Without this information, it's impossible to reverse-engineer or deduce \\\\( u_0 \\\\) solely based on the observed state at T due to the integral transformations and the influence of the linear operator and constant.",
