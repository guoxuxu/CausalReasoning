  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) in the complex plane, and its transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\). We explore how manipulating the function and its transform affects causal relationships within these systems.\n\nGiven the transformed system \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we deduce the exact original function \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the squared function introduces ambiguity between positive and negative roots, hence \\\\( w \\\\) or \\\\( -w \\\\) could have led to the same \\\\( z \\\\). Without additional information, the recovery of \\\\( w \\\\) solely from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is not unique.",
