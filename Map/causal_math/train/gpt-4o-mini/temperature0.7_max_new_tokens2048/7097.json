  "Problem": "Analyze the implications of applying a Fourier transform to a signal and then filtering with a kernel represented by H(s), an analytic function in the complex frequency domain, on the properties of the signal.\n\nIf a signal is Fourier transformed, multiplied by the filter H(s), and then inverse Fourier transformed, will the resulting time-domain function exhibit altered characteristics compared to the original signal?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform followed by multiplication with H(s) changes the frequency components of the signal based on H(s)'s properties. This manipulation typically alters the signal's time-domain characteristics, such as amplitude, phase, and bandwidth, based on H(s)'s functional form.",
