  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transform with a kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze its effect over time t.\n\nIf an intervention is made by modifying the integral transform kernel to \\\\( K'(t, s) = e^{-s} \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant function at any later time T depend only on the new kernel and not on the original kernel?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the kernel of the transform, which impacts how the original and resultant functions are related. Both kernels, the original and the modified one, influence the resulting function through their respective effects on the frequency and decay characteristics of the transformed signal.",
