  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{At}s \\, ds \\\\), where A is a complex number. To analyze the behavior, an intervention by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is also a complex number, is considered over time t.\n\nGiven that a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is implemented at a time t_1, will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the subsequent evolution path of z. Therefore, both A and B influence the resulting state at T, as the transformation impacts how the integral proceeds beyond t_1.",
