  "Problem": "Examine a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. The transformation considered is through the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and the transformed function is let to solve the PDE, will the solution at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) in the physical space be identical to evolving \\\\(u_0\\\\) under the same PDE without applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The action of the Fourier transform on the initial condition changes the representation but not the inherent characteristics of the wave functions under the linear PDE. The inverse transform of the solution in the Fourier space will provide the same results as solving the PDE directly in the physical space.",
