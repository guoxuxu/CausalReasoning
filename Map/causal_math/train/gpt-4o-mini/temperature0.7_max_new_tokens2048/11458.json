  "Problem": "Combining a Fourier transform with complex functions, consider a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transform given by \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} s(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\). Let the effect of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( s(t) \\\\) be defined as a multiplication by a fixed complex exponential, i.e., \\\\( L[s(t)] = e^{\\\\alpha t} s(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the applied complex exponential \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) from the shifted Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega - \\\\alpha) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the shift in the frequency domain indicates a modification by an exponential term, determining the exact value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) solely from the shifted spectrum isn't possible without additional information about either the original signal or the nature of the shift, since multiple \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) values can produce similar spectral shifts.",
