  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) over time t in the complex plane, and its response under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = kz \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the constant k after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge of whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation was applied, we cannot determine if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) has been scaled by k, as it inherently matches the form of the baseline function \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\), just potentially rescaled. Multiple values of k could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane.",
