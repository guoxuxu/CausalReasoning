  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We are interested in the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) before the system evolves.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and left unaltered as the PDE solution evolves, will the transformed system's state \\\\( \\\\widehat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) had evolved directly under the given PDE to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the Fourier transform changes the representation of the data to frequency space, which affects how the diffusion operates on the data. The evolving process in frequency space, governed by the transformed PDE, results in a different state \\\\( \\\\widehat{u}(k, T) \\\\) compared to the direct evolution in real space.",
