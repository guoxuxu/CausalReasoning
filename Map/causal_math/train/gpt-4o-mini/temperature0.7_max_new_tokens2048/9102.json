  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(z(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a given function and \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the behavior of this transformation, specifically how it behaves under modifications of \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(z(w)\\\\) for a particular \\\\(w\\\\), can we determine uniquely the scalar \\\\(a\\\\) used to scale \\\\(f(x)\\\\) in its modification without other information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\(z(w)\\\\) for a specific \\\\(w\\\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the scalar \\\\(a\\\\), as the integral does not preserve unique information about scalar multiplications applied to the input function \\\\(f(x)\\\\).",
