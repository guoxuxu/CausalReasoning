  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is the speed of sound in a medium. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} u(t) dt \\\\), on the transformation of the equation.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after applying a filtering process \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and undergoing natural system evolution, by only analyzing the solution at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the filter alters specific frequency components, which changes the solution dynamics. Without precise knowledge of the filter characteristics and the initial form of \\\\( u(t) \\\\), reconstructing the exact initial state at t = 0 from observations at t = T becomes ambiguous due to potential alterations in the frequency domain.",
