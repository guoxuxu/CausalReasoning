  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\), which converts it from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result of a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\cdot e^{i \\phi} \\\\), can the exact original time function be uniquely determined to be \\\\( e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi)} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the phase factor \\\\( e^{i \\phi} \\\\) in the Fourier transform points directly to the phase shift in the original function. This specific information allows for the precise reconstruction of the time-domain expression \\\\( e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi)} \\\\), identifying not only its frequency but also its phase.",
