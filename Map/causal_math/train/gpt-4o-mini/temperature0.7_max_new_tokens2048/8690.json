  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iB\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) applied at time t, with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at t = T, without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces changes that depend on the integral of the state's history modified by \\\\( e^{-iB\\\\tau} \\\\). This integrated effect cannot be simply reversed or deduced from the state at t=T alone, making it difficult to trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",
