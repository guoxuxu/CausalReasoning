  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\), where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of implementing a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) on x(t) and then applying an inverse Fourier transform to observe the effects on the evolution of x(t) over time.\n\nGiven the observed state \\( x(T) \\) at time T, can we determine if a Fourier transform was applied at time t = 0 without knowing whether it was immediately reversed?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform followed by its inverse would bring the function back to its original state, leaving no trace of its application. Thus, observing \\( x(T) \\) alone does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the transformations were applied without additional context.",
