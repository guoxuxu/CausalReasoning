  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nObserving the transformed Fourier transform output \\\\( F(z(w_0)) \\\\), can we deduce whether the original parameter was \\\\( w_0 \\\\) or another complex number?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) could imply any of a set of original parameters \\\\( w_0, w_1, ..., w_n \\\\) rotated by different multiples of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). Without additional information about \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or the specific rotation applied, identifying the original parameter accurately is not certain.",
