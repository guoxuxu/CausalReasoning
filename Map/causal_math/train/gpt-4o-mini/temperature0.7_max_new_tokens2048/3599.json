  "Problem": "Examine a convolution integral system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} x(\\\\tau) h(t-\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response, a known function. Changes are made to the input signal via transformation \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\), with a being a constant.\n\nIf at any point in time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( g(x) = x(t) - e^{bt} \\\\) is applied, where b is a constant different from a, will the output at any subsequent time point T exclusively depend on the original convolution settings and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduces another modification to the input signal which influences subsequent convolution results. Both modifications \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) reshape the input in ways which cumulatively affect the output signal thereby impacting the overall system response.",
