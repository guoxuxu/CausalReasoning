  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its impact on an integral transform described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We explore how the Laplace Transform of this function changes under different scenarios.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is increased, without any other intervention, will this change the convergence of the Laplace Transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) affects the oscillatory nature of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\). The Laplace Transform's convergence is sensitive to changes in the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) because it affects the behavior of the exponential decay required for convergence, particularly as \\\\( \\\\Re(s) \\\\) needs to be greater than zero for convergence.",
