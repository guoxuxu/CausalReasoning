  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a set of functions defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) represents a rotation by A in the complex plane over time t. Additionally, let there be a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the rotation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition to \\\\( e^{iB0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as time progresses, the factor \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) applies a different rotation compared to \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\). This results in a trajectory deviation, leading to a distinct endpoint at any time T ≠ 0.",
