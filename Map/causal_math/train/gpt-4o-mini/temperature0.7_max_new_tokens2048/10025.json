  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex function, let \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. The transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex number, is applied to study its influence.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under both \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with the complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) modifies both the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), hence changing the trajectory of the entire complex function over time. This addition of a complex factor will likely yield a different endpoint for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any given point T.",
