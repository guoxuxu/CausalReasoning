  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nGiven the oscillator's position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the oscillator's original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Because the phase alteration by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) can change the initial conditions in a non-trivial manner, knowing just \\\\( x(T) \\\\) doesn't uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\), as the alteration in phase remains unknown.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The mapping function g(x) applies a phase rotation to the oscillator's position x, affecting its representation at time T. The oscillator's original position x_0 influences its position at time T, while the oscillator's angular frequency ω governs the acceleration of the oscillator's motion. The position x at time T also determines the acceleration through the second derivative relation.",
