  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) on a rod extending from \\\\(x=0\\\\) to \\\\(x=L\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature at point \\\\(x\\\\) at time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\) and its modification via a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[f](k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx}dx\\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original temperature profile \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) perfectly from observing \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) if the Fourier transform was applied before the heat equation took effect?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the Fourier transformation and the solution to the heat equation, diffusive processes are inherently lossy with respect to information about the high-frequency components of the initial profile. This information loss prevents exact reconstruction of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\).",
