  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) for a matrix M.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) transforms an initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further actions, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without transformation under the same system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) changes the initial conditions. Because M might not commute with D, the trajectory will be altered, resulting in a state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) that differs from the state obtained by evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( Dx \\\\).",
