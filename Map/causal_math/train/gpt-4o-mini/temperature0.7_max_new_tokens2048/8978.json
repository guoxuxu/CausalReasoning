  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) evolved under \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\) without knowing about any transformation, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of stochastic integral \\\\( dB_t \\\\) introduces randomness into the system, making it impossible to accurately backtrack the exact initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) due solely to the information at time T, particularly without explicit knowledge of applied transformations.",
