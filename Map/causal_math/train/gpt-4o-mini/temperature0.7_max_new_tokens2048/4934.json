  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. The impact of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is analyzed to understand its effects on the solution trajectory over variable \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nKnowing the solution \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we precisely determine the original initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(x) = e^{ax}\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(f(x)\\\\) modifies the initial condition in a way that fundamentally alters the output, and attempting to recover \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) without this knowledge leads to ambiguity in the presence of the spatial transformation, as multiple initial states can lead to similar evolved states citing the uniqueness property of solutions to linear PDEs.",
