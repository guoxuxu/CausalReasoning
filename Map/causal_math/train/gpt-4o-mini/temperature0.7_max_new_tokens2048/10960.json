  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a rotational motion in the complex plane. We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) applied at time T affects this motion.\n\nKnowing only the final value of \\\\( H(z)(T) \\\\) after interventions in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) at various times, can we accurately trace back and identify each intervention and its timings?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( H(z) \\\\) cumulatively incorporates the impact of all prior states and changes over the interval. Distinguishing between effects of different interventions solely based on the final value of \\\\( H(z)(T) \\\\) is complex due to the convolution of effects over time, which blurs individual contributions and timing of changes.",
