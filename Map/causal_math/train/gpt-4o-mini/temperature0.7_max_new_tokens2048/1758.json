  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function.\n\nFrom the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform can uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) if it adheres to conditions like causality and stability, since \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) fully describes the evolution.",
