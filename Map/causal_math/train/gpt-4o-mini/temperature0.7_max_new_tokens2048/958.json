  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BdW \\\\), where \\\\( W(t) \\\\) is a standard Brownian motion and A, B are matrices. Let's analyze the influence of a deterministic control policy \\\\( u(t) = Ce^{Dt}X(t) \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices integrated over a time interval.\n\nGiven the trajectory \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at some time t, can we infer the original state \\\\( X(0) \\\\) without having any information about a control policy \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even in the absence of a control policy, the presence of the stochastic term \\\\( BdW \\\\) introduces randomness that prevents exact back-calculation of \\\\( X(0) \\\\) from \\\\( X(t) \\\\). The stochastic nature implies multiple possible initial states could lead to the observed states at time t.",
