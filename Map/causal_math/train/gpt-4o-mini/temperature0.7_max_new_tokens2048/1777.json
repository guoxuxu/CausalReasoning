  "Problem": "Consider a vector field expressed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. Analyze the effect when a Möbius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\) is applied to z, where a, b, c, d are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex variable \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Möbius transformation changes the initial conditions of the system. The new trajectory initiated by \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) will follow a different path under the dynamics specified by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), leading to a different end state at time T.",
