  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x, y, t) + iv(x, y, t) \\\\), a complex-valued function of two spatial variables and time, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions.\n\nIf the initial value of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is set to be \\\\( e^{ax+by} \\\\) (where a and b are constants), and this state evolves according to the given differential equation without any further intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time T necessarily reflect only the effects of the original equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the system's evolution depends solely on the initial conditions and the specific differential equation provided. The exponential function \\\\( e^{ax+by} \\\\) satisfies the Laplacian operation and will evolve predictably under the provided partial differential equation, with effects solely attributable to the equation.",
