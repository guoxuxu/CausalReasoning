  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) which describes a point moving on the unit circle in the complex plane over time t. We explore the response of the system under an integral transformation described by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and simply integrated over time (without any additional transformation), will the result \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) describe a circular motion in the complex plane at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) yields a function that accumulates values along a spiral path in the complex plane, rather than describing a simple circular motion. The integral inherently alters the nature of the trajectory as it provides a cumulative effect rather than a cyclic one.",
