  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) the initial complex vector in a system. An integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int e^{-At}z(t) dt \\\\) impacts this setup over a period \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nCan the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the integral transformation output \\\\( T[z] \\\\) knowing only the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) without prior knowledge of whether any function was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The result of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) depends on the whole path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which is uniquely traced back only if \\\\( A \\\\) has distinct, non-repeating eigenvalues. Without this, or additional information, the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
