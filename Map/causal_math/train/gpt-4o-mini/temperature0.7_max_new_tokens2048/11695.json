  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) is introduced and \\\\( v_0 \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( Qv_0 \\\\) as an intervention, will the characteristics of \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still relate only to \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( P \\\\) or \\\\( Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) as an intervention can substantially alter the vector's relationship to \\\\( A \\\\)'s eigenproperties. The resultant vector at \\\\( T \\\\) may or may not behave as an eigenvector of \\\\( A \\\\), depending on how \\\\( Q \\\\) interacts with the eigenspace of \\\\( A \\\\).",
