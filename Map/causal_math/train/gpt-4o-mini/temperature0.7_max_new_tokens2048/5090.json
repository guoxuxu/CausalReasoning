  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a system matrix and B is a control matrix, coupled with a control input u. We analyze the impact of applying a state-dependent transformation \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T having no knowledge whether transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied initially, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information about whether \\\\( Cx_0 \\\\) or just \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was the initial condition creates ambiguity. Without knowing if the transformation occurred, or the exact nature of C (unless it is the identity matrix), the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved.",
