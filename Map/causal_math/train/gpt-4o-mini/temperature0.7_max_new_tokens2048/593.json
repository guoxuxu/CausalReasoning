  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex scalar. A transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(m\\\\) is a complex scalar.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\) to \\\\(t = T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\(e^{mz_0}\\\\). The evolution under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\) will thus start from a different initial state, and the complex exponential nature of the transformation leads to a different trajectory and endpoint.",
