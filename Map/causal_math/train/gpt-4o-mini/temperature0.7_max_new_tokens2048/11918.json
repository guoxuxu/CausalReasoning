  "Problem": "In a physics experiment, a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) is modeled using the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a Hamiltonian operator. We run simulations using an initial condition \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) modified by a function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) representing a constant wave number.\n\nIf a phase adjustment \\\\( g(\\\\psi) = e^{-iKx}\\\\psi \\\\) is applied at some time t_1 as an intervention, will the final wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the Hamiltonian \\\\( H \\\\) and not on the actions of \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\) at time t_1 modifies the wave function's phase again, potentially cancelling or reinforcing effects from the initial function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\). This interaction makes \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial phase modification by \\\\( K \\\\) and the intervention, alongside the inherently governing dynamics of \\\\( H \\\\).",
