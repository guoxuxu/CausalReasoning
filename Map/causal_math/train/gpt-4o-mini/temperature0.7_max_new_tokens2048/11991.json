  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform and its implications on signal processing.\n\nGiven the frequency domain output of a transformed and system-processed signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we determine the specific form of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) applied, knowing the original frequency \\\\( ω \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency domain representation post-intervention can potentially align with different forms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) due to the convolution properties and spectral overlap. Without additional constraints or data, multiple impulse responses could theoretically yield similar transformations, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from the frequency domain output alone.",
