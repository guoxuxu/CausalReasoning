  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system characterized by linear transformations over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We evaluate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) at different times, where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T = 1 be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T = 1 under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). The evolution will thus follow the path determined by \\\\( e^{Dt}Mx_0 \\\\) rather than \\\\( e^{Dt}x_0 \\\\). Unless M commutes with \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) for all t, the resulting state at T = 1 will differ from the non-transformed trajectory.",
