  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) which is a mapping from the complex plane to itself, given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The time evolution of a system is initially influenced by the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\), then governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\), where c is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely from the endpoint value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which transformations were applied (\\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible as different combinations of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) could yield the same endpoint due to the properties of complex exponentials, such as their periodic nature and effects on the phases of complex numbers.",
