  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) is applied to a complex variable z, where A is a complex constant. The effect of this transformation over time, modeled by \\\\( z(t) = f(z(t-1)) \\\\\\), is assessed with and without interventions.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied repeatedly starting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without any external intervention, will the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) be geometrically spiraling outwards if \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(A) > 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) rotates and scales the complex number z. Repeated applications result in continued rotation and scaling according to the real part of A, and if \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(A) > 0 \\\\\\), it continuously scales z outward, creating a spiral effect.",
