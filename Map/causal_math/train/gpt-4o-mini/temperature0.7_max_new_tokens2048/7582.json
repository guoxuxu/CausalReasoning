  "Problem": "Suppose we analyze the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}x + \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}Bu(s) \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. This system reflects the solution to a linear time-invariant dynamic system with input.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( x \\\\) and the control path \\\\( u(t) \\\\) over [0, T] without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The linear superposition principle allows multiple combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) that might yield the same state at time T, particularly when the matrices A and B provide non-unique system responses due to their properties.",
