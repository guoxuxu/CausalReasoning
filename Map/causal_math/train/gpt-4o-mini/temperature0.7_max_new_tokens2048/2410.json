  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining a trajectory in the complex plane over time t. Let there be a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nObserving the trajectory \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can one deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of the rotation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly reconstruct the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the observed state could any complex number rotated by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\), generating ambiguity in retracing \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
