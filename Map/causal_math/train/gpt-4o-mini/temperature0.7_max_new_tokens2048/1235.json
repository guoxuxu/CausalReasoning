  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\( c \\\\) is a fixed complex constant. This function is related to iterative mappings used in fractal generation like the Mandelbrot set. We investigate how initial values and transformations influence the resulting behavior after multiple iterations.\n\nIf an external transformation defined by another complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied at each iteration step, will the nature of the boundedness of the sequence change?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) results in rotation of the complex number \\\\( z \\\\) on the complex plane and does not affect the modulus of \\\\( z \\\\). Since the boundedness of the sequence in the Mandelbrot fractal generation process depends on the modulus, the nature of boundedness remains unaffected by the rotational transformation.",
