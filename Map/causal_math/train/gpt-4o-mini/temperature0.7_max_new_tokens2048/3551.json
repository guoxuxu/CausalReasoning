  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the behavior of a scalar field \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation. The equation is \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. An integral transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) dx \\\\) is applied to study the system's evolution.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by modifying the diffusion constant to \\\\( D' \\\\), will \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial transformation and not on the change in constant from D to D'?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the diffusion constant modifies the underlying behavior of the partial differential equation governing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\). This modification alters how \\\\( u \\\\) diffuses over space, thereby affecting the resultant transform \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\). Since the diffusion process influences the transformation, both the initial conditions and the intervention affect the outcome.",
