  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\}(s) = F(s)\\\\). We evaluate how a convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) impacts the transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then transformed, is the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the Laplace domain. Thus, convolving \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) results in the Laplace transform being shifted by \\\\( a \\\\), which indeed results in \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\). There are no additional time-dependent changes because the transform shift is calculated instantly.",
