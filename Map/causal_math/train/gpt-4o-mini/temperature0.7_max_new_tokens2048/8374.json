  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. The impact of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), on this function is considered.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective mapping for functions meeting its criteria, meaning each transformed function has a unique pre-image. Thus, knowing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), one can uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
