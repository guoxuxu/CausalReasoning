  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant frequency parameter. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by an additional function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) that adjusts its amplitude, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T > t_1 demonstrate solely the effect of the original \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\) frequency component?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies the amplitude, and potentially the phase, thereby altering the original frequency components present in \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T > t_1 reflects the new characteristics introduced by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), alongside the original frequency determined by \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\).",
