  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) with a delta function at a specific frequency, can we determine whether an intervention (frequency shift by \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)) was applied and identify the value of \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) just by observing \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function at a certain frequency in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) only informs us about the effective frequency in the transformed function. Without prior information, it is impossible to confirm whether this frequency resulted from an intervention (such as a shift by \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)) or was the inherent frequency of the original function.",
