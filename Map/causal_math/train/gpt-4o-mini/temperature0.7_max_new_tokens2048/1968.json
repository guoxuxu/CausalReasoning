  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) refers to time. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the function and consider intervention through an inverse Laplace transform at different times.\n\nGiven the transformed Laplace outcome \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\) from an unknown transformation \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), can we specifically identify the transformation applied (i.e., the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) purely based on the final Laplace expression?",
  "Explanation": "The expression \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\) specifically defines the transformation as multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), allowing for the exact identification of the intervention \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) purely from the form of the Laplace transform.",
