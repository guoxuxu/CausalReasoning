  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation governing heat distribution \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with initial heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\). An operation \\\\(g(u) = e^{wt}u\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(w\\) is a constant, which alters the heat distribution dynamically.\n\nObserving the heat distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, is it possible to determine whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied at t=0 or if the distribution merely evolved from \\\\(f(x)\\\\) under \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\) without any transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the heat distribution at time T and without additional information, it is impossible to ascertain whether the initial condition was scaled by \\\\(e^{wt}\\\\). The distribution could result from various initial conditions given the nature of heat diffusion expressing multiple possible precursors.",
