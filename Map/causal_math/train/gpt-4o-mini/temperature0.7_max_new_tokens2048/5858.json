  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) applied as a transformation on a time-dependent signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), producing a new signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\). Where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. This scenario explores the relation and transformation effect with and without interventions such as changing the frequency or applying a damping factor.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely trace back to the original signal \\\\(x(0)\\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\(y(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} x(t)\\\\), without the knowledge of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), one cannot accurately retrieve \\\\(x(0)\\\\) because different values of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) could lead to different initial conditions that would yield the same \\\\(y(T)\\\\) after the transformation.",
