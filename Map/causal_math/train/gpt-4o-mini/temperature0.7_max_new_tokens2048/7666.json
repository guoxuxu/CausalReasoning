  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a response function represented by the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. A signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is input into the system, and its Laplace transform is \\\\( X(s) \\\\). The output of the system, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is given by the inverse Laplace transform of the product \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) observed at \\\\( t = T \\\\), and knowing the form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine the exact form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Although the problem might seem straightforward for simple examples, in general, multiple different inputs \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could result in the same output due to the non-invertibility of systems with similar frequency responses or damping characteristics. Without additional constraints or information, exact recovery of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is typically not feasible in real-world scenarios.",
