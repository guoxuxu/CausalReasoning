  "Problem": "Examine the effect of integrating a complex function using different contours in the complex plane. We consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) varies over different contours.\n\nIf we deform the original contour to a different shape that still encloses \\\\( a \\\\) and integrate \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the integral value change?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the contour integral of a function around a singularity is dependent solely on the residues of the function at the points enclosed and not on the shape of the contour, as long as none of the singularities are crossed. Thus, if the modified contour still encloses the same singularity \\\\( a \\\\), the integral's value remains unchanged.",
