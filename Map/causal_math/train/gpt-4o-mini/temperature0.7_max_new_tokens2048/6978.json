  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant frequency parameter. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the outcome of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T, can we precisely determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under suitable conditions on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) (such as being square-integrable over its domain) and can thus be perfectly inverted to retrieve \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any time T given that the evolution does not change the frequency content.",
