  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function is subjected to a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nBased solely on the Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega)\\\\) at a specific frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), can we accurately deduce the initial conditions of \\\\(x_0\\\\) and \\\\(y_0\\\\) without knowing the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform, while revealing certain frequency components of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), does not provide enough information to uniquely reconstruct the initial states \\\\(x_0\\\\) and \\\\(y_0\\\\) without additional information about the matrices A and B, which dictate the evolution.",
