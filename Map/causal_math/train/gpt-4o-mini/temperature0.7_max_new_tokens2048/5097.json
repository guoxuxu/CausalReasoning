  "Problem": "Suppose we have a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. Consider the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) where M is a square matrix, at various times.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and it evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) until time T without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was simply allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). The evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) from this new initial condition generally leads to a different state at time T, particularly if M is not a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.",
