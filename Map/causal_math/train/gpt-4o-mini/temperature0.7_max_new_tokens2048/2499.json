  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system governed by a vector field \\\\(V(z) = i\\\\beta z\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant. The transformation considered is \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, and t represents time.\n\nSuppose at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention is applied to the system with \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) is another complex constant). Will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new scaling and rotational dynamic because of \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), which affects the evolution post-intervention. Hence, the final state depends on the interaction between \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), and the field coefficient \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), altering the system's trajectory through complex scaling.",
