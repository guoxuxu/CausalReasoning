  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), such that \\\\( F(s) = L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} \\\\) represents the transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into the complex frequency domain. Let us analyze how the convolution operation with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) affects the transformed system.\n\nIf a convolution \\\\( (f * g)(t) \\\\) is applied and then transformed using Laplace transform without any further intervention, does the result \\\\( L\\\\{(f * g)(t)\\\\} \\\\) equal the product of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), where \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the properties of the Laplace transform, the transform of the convolution of two functions equates to the product of their individual transforms in the frequency domain. Hence, \\\\( L\\\\{(f * g)(t)\\\\} = F(s)G(s) \\\\).",
