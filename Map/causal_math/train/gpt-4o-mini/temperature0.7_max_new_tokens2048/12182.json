  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is considered.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st^2} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the result of \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) at t = T completely ignore the intervention by U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U \\\\) modifies the system, altering the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and consequently the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) at any time later than \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect this change, integrating a different function affected by U.",
