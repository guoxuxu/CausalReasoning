  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are matrices denoting the system dynamics and input matrix, respectively. We analyze the effect of the linear state feedback controller defined by \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nObserving the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), without knowing whether the feedback controller was applied, can we conclusively determine whether \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was subjected to the controller or uncontrolled?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the application of the feedback controller, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone does not provide sufficient information to unravel whether the controller was used. The state could reach the same point under different system configurations and initial conditions.",
