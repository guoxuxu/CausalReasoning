  "Problem": "Consider a physical system whose state at time t is given by the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), and governed by the second order linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{z} + p\\\\dot{z} + qz = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the effect of transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) observed at time T, can we deduce the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), the observed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from different initial conditions altered by the complex exponential. This ambiguity, coupled with the natural evolution of the differential equation, prevents uniquely determining the initial state.",
