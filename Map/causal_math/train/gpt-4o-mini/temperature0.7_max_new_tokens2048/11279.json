  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a function space, described by the integral transform \\\\(T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s)f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(x, s)\\\\) is the kernel function. We examine the transformation's behavior when the function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) is introduced, and how adding a multiplication by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) as an intervention affects transformations.\n\nIf at a certain point a modulation by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\) for the altered \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}e^{as}\\\\) be equivalent to that from the original function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the form of \\\\(f(s)\\\\), specifically modulating it by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\), which will alter the integral transform outcome due to the change in the function's behavior across the domain of integration. This results in a potentially different \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\).",
