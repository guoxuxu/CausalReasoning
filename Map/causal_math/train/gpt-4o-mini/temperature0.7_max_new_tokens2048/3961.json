  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the effects of transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the state at time T, be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by multiplying it by \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), thus changing the trajectory. Considering that this modification decays the amplitude over time, the state at time T will be different due to the altered dynamics introduced by \\\\( h(z) \\\\).",
