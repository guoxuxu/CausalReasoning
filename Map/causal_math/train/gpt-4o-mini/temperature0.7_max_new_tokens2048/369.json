  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We assess the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\) which changes the domain from spatial coordinates x to wave numbers k.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and then the transformed equation is solved under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\hat{L}\\\\hat{u} \\\\) without further spatial domain intervention, will the resulting \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) reflect the solution of the original equation evolved directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear transformation and retains all information necessary to evolve \\\\( \\\\hat{u} \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\), the transformed operator. Solving the transformed equation correctly represents the evolution of the original system due to the linear properties of L and the Fourier transform.",
