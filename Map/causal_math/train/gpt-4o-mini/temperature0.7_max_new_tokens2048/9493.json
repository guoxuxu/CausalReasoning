  "Problem": "In a control system, a linear time-invariant differential equation describes the system's dynamics: \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The effect of control input is modeled by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), where K is a control matrix applied at time t.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\) to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and allow the system to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without any further input, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was evolved simply under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) until time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state in a way that the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) will now proceed from this altered initial condition. Unless K is such that \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\) commutes with the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) or is trivial (e.g., K = 0), the state trajectory and final state at time T will generally differ from not applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
