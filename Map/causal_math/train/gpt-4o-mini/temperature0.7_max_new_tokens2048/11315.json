  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a diagonal matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf an additional integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied at an intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), depend only on the original differential equation and not on the application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or \\\\( T(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) introduces an external influence on the system's evolution, impacting the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) along with the initial modification by \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This makes the final state a product of the matrix M, the integral transformation, and the initial application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
