  "Problem": "In this setting, we analyze the behavior of a function z(t) defined in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Bw \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( u(t) = e^{Ct}w(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend uniquely on the original evolution parameter \\\\( B \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the evolution path and thus the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will also depend significantly on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). The results at T are a consequence not just of the initial evolution parameter \\\\( B \\\\) but also how \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) influence the phase and magnitude of w during their periods of influence.",
