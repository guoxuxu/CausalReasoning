  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = M\\\\mathbf{x}(t)\\\\), where M is a constant 2x2 matrix. Explore the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the system, where the Laplace transform of a vector function is applied component-wise.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(0)\\\\) as it was prior to any transformations with certainty?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system evolves from the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = M\\\\mathbf{x}(t)\\\\) and the transformation is linear and time-invariant, knowing \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\) and the system matrix M allows for uniquely determining \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(0)\\\\) through the mathematical inversion process of the solving the system's differential equation.",
