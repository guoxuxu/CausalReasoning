  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(z(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a given function and \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the behavior of this transformation, specifically how it behaves under modifications of \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformed function \\\\(z(w)\\\\), can we determine exactly the sequence or nature of scalar modifications (values of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\)) applied to \\\\(f(x)\\\\), knowing the value of \\\\(z(w)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determination of the exact scalars \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) used based solely on the endpoint \\\\(z(w)\\\\) is not feasible. It's due to the fundamental ambiguity in their combined scaling effect since multiple pairs of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) could lead to equivalent results.",
