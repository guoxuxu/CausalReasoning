  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this function, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation, such as a phase shift represented by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) = e^{-i\\\\phi(\\\\omega)} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the function reconstructed from this modified transform depend only on the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and not \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the phase shift function \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) alters the Fourier transform, hence affecting the reconstructed signal. The output will depend on the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the introduced phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\), altering amplitude and/or phase of the components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
