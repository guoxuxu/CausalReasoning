  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation being considered is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIs it feasible to uniquely identify the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, not knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) involving the exponential factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) was applied, the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could be any of multiple possible values depending on the phase and magnitude altered by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
