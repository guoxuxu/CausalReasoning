  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a linear transformation on a complex function. Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, representing a unit circle in the complex plane. The transformation given is \\\\( T(z) = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, and given the fact that \\\\( k \\\\) can be any real number, multiple original states could correspond to the same observed state at time T. Specifically, both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( kz_0 \\\\) could evolve to the same \\\\( z(t) \\\\) if the transformation adjusts the magnitude appropriately.",
