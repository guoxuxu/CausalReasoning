  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining a trajectory in the complex plane over time t. Let there be a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be equal to the trajectory tracing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) rotated by \\\\( \\\\omega T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) at initial time rotates the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by a phase \\\\( \\\\omega t \\\\). Without further intervention, the transformation simply adds a constant rotation at each time point resulting in a trajectory that is a rotated version of the original trajectory by \\\\( \\\\omega T \\\\).",
