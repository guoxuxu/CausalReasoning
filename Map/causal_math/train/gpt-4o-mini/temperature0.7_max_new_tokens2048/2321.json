  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a set of points \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane undergoes a transformation defined by the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Post-transformation, these points are subjected to an integral transformation, \\\\( T(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{iw} dw \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the interval [0, 2\\\\pi] without any further modifications, does the application of the integral transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\) yield the same result as applying \\\\( T \\\\) directly to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) changes the function from \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) to \\\\( w(t) = e^{ie^{it}} \\\\), which alters the domain and nature of the function vastly due to the exponential of an exponential term. Thus, the result of the integral transformation on \\\\( w(t) \\\\) will be different than applying it directly on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
