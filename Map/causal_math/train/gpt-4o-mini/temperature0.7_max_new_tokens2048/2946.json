  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\) describes the evolution of a variable vector \\\\( z \\\\) through a linear transformation system in time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. Another function \\\\( w(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix, applies another linear transformation at an arbitrary time.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation \\\\( C \\\\) could have modified \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in various ways depending on its properties relative to \\\\( A \\\\), leading to different possible initial states.",
