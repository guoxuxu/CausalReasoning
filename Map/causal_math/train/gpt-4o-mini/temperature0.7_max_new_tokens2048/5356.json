  "Problem": "Investigate a system under the effect of a linear transformation expressed through the matrix exponential. The system is defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, and the impact of transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), by only observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations or timing of interventions due to the properties of matrix exponentials and their non-commutative nature affecting the resulting trajectories. The overlap in potential states resulting makes it impossible to unequivocally deduce the history of interventions.",
