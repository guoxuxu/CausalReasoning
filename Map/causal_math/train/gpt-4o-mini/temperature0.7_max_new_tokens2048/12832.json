  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of electrical impedance in a circuit as a function of the frequency, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega) = R + \\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C} + j\\\\omega L\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) are resistance, capacitance, and inductance respectively, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Z(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to study the system's response.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is increased without adding any components to the circuit, will the impedance \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) at a higher frequency be the same as initially modeled by \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) affects each component of the impedance differently due to their frequency-dependent nature. The capacitive reactance decreases with increasing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), while inductive reactance increases, thereby changing the overall impedance.",
