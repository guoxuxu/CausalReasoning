  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit containing an RLC (Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor) series circuit driven by a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V0 * sin(ωt). The relationship between the input voltage and current is governed by the differential equation L*d^2I/dt^2 + R*dI/dt + (1/C)*I = dV/dt, where I is the current, L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nIf at time t1, an additional resistive component R1 is introduced in parallel to the existing RLC circuit and the driving frequency ω is increased, will the new steady state solution for current I(t) at time t > t1 be significantly different?'",
  "Explanation": "Adding a parallel resistor R1 modifies the overall resistance of the circuit, altering the damping factor (R total). Increasing the driving frequency ω also impacts the impedance due to the inductive and capacitive components, affecting amplitude and phase of the current. Together, these factors converge to significantly alter the system's dynamic and steady state response compared to the original configuration.",
