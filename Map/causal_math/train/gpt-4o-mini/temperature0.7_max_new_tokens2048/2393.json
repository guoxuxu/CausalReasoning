  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We investigate the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\) on the function over time t.\n\nIf the Fourier transformation is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to proceed without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) at some frequency \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\) remain identical to the initial function over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), which is ideally a delta function at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), signifies an exact frequency component. However, applying the Fourier transformation alters the function into a different domain (frequency domain), which fundamentally changes its representation and cannot be equated directly to the time-domain function over time.",
