  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = L(h(t))  = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). We analyze the effect of modifying this system by convolution with another function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing whether convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the alteration caused by the shift in Laplace transform domain makes it challenging to reliably trace back and reconstruct \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\), as the original properties are obscured.",
