  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is an input function. We study how manipulations through a specific function \\\\( g(x) = x + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, influence the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we deduce precisely which interventions (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) could be the result of various combinations of interventions due to linear superposition, and the specific individual impact of each intervention (how much was shifted by \\\\( c \\\\) or by \\\\( d \\\\)) cannot be discerned solely from the final value of \\\\( y(T) \\\\). Multiple scenarios could yield the same final output.",
