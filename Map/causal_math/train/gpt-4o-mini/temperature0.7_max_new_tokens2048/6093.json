  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) under an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] \\\\) without further modification, will the transformed function only depend on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without being influenced by the initial choice of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] \\\\) directly depends on both the frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the decay component \\\\( s \\\\). The choice of \\\\( s \\\\) significantly affects the outcome of the integral, and thereby the final transformed function is influenced by both parameters.",
