  "Problem": "We consider a mathematical model where two complex variables, z and w, are related via the transform \\( f(z) = ze^{iw} \\) at an initial time t = 0. Over time, w evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\), with A being a complex constant. We examine the influence of an early intervention at a time \\( t_1 \\) defined by the function \\( g(w) = w + C \\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( g(w) = w + C \\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) be dependent only on A and not on \\( f(z) \\) or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(w) \\) adds a complex constant C to w, modifying how w evolves thereafter. Since w influences z through the transform \\( f(z) = ze^{iw} \\), the change in w due to C affects the evolution of z, making \\( z(T) \\) dependent on C and A as well as the initial application of \\( f(z) \\).",
