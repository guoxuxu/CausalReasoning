  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\), with M being a constant complex matrix. We analyze the change when applying a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iNt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were used by only analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied is challenging as different applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), and even their orders, can result in the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The non-identifiable interaction effects due to non-commutative properties of \\\\( e^{iNt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-iN't} \\\\) complicates precise causal inference from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
