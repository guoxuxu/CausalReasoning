  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + xu_x = 0 \\), where \\( u(t, x) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) and space \\( x \\). Investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\xi x}u(t, x)dx \\) on the system over time.\n\nIf a transformation \\( \\hat{v}(t, \\xi) = e^{i\\xi^2t}\\hat{u}(t, \\xi) \\) is applied at some point \\( t_1 \\), will the behavior of \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) accurately reflect the initial characteristics dictated by \\( u(0, x) \\) solely under its inherent dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( e^{i\\xi^2t} \\) alters the propagation characteristics significantly by introducing new dynamics in \\( \\xi \\)-space, making the final state a product of both the inherent dynamics and the intervention.",
