  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), resulting in the partial differential equation \\\\( Lu = 0 \\\\). We investigate the system's response to a mapping defined by \\\\( v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)] \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) represents a Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T[u(x,t)] \\\\) is computed at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) evolves under the same operator \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to the situation where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was evolved directly to \\\\( T \\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform as \\\\( T \\\\) changes the function's spectral components. Even under the same linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), the evolution of transformed and original functions can differ significantly due to changes in how different frequency components react to the operator.",
