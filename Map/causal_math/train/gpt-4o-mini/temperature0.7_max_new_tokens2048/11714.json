  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, there are multiple potential original states \\\\( z_0 \\\\) that could result in the same observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially without explicit knowledge of B. The lack of information on B creates ambiguity in retracing \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
