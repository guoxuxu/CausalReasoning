  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal frequency. The transformation applied is a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform output \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) after an unknown filtering, can we determine whether the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) was part of the signal?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specifics of the interventional filter, it's not feasible to accurately conclude the presence or absence of the specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the original signal. The spectrum could have been altered to either retain or remove any frequency, making it impossible to deduce the unaltered signal characteristics reliably.",
