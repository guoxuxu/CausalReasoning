  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. We investigate how the function affects solutions to the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\), where M is another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final vector \\\\( w(Z) \\\\), can we determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) only by knowing the value of \\\\( w(Z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex interactions between the non-commutative properties of \\\\( e^{Kz} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Cz} \\\\), and the solution to the differential equation, multiple transformation combinations (involving K, C, or both, applied at various z values) could yield the same \\\\( w(Z) \\\\). The presence of these interactions makes it impossible to distinguish and accurately determine which transformation happened only from the final state.",
