  "Problem": "Investigate a situation where the effectiveness of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied to a signal analyzed using the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides a method to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain representation.\n\nCan we determine the original time-domain signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and observing its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied, the changed frequency spectrum observed through \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) will not directly indicate the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The frequency shift introduced by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) obscures the original characteristics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), making it impossible to deduce without further information.",
