  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\), which converts it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without altering \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the primary frequency component of the transform at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a complex exponential function like \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) naturally highlights its frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), showing a Dirac delta function at this frequency. Without changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or additional interventions, this characteristic is preserved.",
