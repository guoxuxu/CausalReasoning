  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where u and v are real-valued functions of time governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\lambda)z + k|z|^2z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega, \\\\lambda\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants. The scenario explores the consequences of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the complex function's behavior over time, with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) as a complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a certain time T, can we determine the precise initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if unknown whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The existence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) adds ambiguity, as it affects the scaling and phase of the complex function. Without knowing the factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), the original initial condition cannot be uniquely resolved due to possible variations in amplitude and phase initiated by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
