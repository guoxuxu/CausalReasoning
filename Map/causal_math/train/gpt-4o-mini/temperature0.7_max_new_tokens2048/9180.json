  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nWith known endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine both the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) only by knowing the dynamics \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) and endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) or additional constraints, it is impossible to uniquely specify what transformations were applied at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) could produce the same endpoint due to the properties of complex multiplication.",
