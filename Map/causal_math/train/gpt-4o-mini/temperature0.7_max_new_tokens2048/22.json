  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\Delta z\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient, and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We also introduce a transformation function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\int e^{-sD}z ds\\\\), assumed to act on the system at a specific point.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 by solely observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T, without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), it is challenging to reverse the diffusion process accurately as the transformation could have altered initial conditions irreversibly, especially considering the integral and exponential operations which complicate backtracking the initial state.",
