  "Problem": "Analyze a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) is considered as an intervention on the system, with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf we observe the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = T \\\\) without any intervention, does the resulting function value depend exclusively on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no intervention was introduced, the evolution of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T depends solely on the exponentiation driven by \\\\( A \\\\), hence the state at \\\\( z = T \\\\) is ruled only by transformations induced by \\\\( A \\\\).",
