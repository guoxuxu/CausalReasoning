  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nBy observing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations (either \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied throughout the motion, solely based on the position at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) may result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) values, leading to identical or indistinguishable positions due to the cosine and sine components in harmonic motion. This makes it impossible to uniquely identify which transformations were applied.",
