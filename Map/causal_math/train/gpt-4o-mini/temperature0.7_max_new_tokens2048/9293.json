  "Problem": "Suppose a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz + I(t)\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant complex matrix and \\\\(I(t)\\\\) represents a time-dependent input. The transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is another constant complex matrix, is considered.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz\\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will modify the initial condition to \\\\( e^{Kt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which will lead to a different trajectory when evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz \\\\) owing to the change in initial conditions and the influence of the matrix \\\\(K\\\\) over time.",
