  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the Laplace equation in a rectangular domain, governed by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\). We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions of the domain. Let the boundary conditions change from function \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) to \\\\(h(x, y) = g(x, y) + e^{kx}\\\\), where `k` is a constant.\n\nKnowing the internal solution and that an intervention was performed, can we identify whether the original boundary was set by \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) or another function?",
  "Explanation": "Even knowing that an intervention occurred, multiple possible original boundary functions could lead to the same internal solution after various corrections are made. Without explicit knowledge of the nature and precise effect of the intervention, deducing the exact original boundary condition or distinguishing it from others remains uncertain.",
