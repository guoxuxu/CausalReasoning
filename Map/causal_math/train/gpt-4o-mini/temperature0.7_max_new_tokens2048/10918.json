  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a time-varying two-dimensional system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant 2x2 matrix. We explore the consequence of intervention through a transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\), where \\\\(N\\\\) is another constant 2x2 matrix.\n\nCan the original state \\\\(z_0\\\\) be determined precisely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) observed at time T, if it is unknown whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge about the application of transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\), retracing to the original state \\\\(z_0\\\\) would be ambiguous as the transformation could have altered it in a manner dependent on the structure of matrix \\\\(N\\\\), which might not possibly be inferred from the final state alone, especially if \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\) do not commute.",
