  "Problem": "Consider the discrete-time system defined by the equation \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Bx\\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we trace back accurately to the original vector \\\\(y_0\\\\) after observing the state \\\\(y(N)\\\\) at n = N, without knowing if the transformation \\\\(g(y)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\(B\\\\), the transformation \\\\(g\\\\) that might have occurred at the initial state makes it difficult to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(y_0\\\\). Since \\\\(B\\\\) might have changed the initial conditions irreversibly, deduction of \\\\(y_0\\\\) from \\\\(y(N)\\\\) is uncertain without additional data on \\\\(B\\\\).",
