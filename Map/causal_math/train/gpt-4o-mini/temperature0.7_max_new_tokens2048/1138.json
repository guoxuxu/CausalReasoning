  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output, can we confirm that the original function was \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a single delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\) in the Fourier transform uniquely identifies the original function as \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\), since this transform is characteristic of that specific exponential function with a single frequency.",
