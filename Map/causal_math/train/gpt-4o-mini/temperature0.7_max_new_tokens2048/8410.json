  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system represents a basic integral transformation with a complex exponential kernel. We investigate the influence of a matrix multiplier \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we exactly determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any previous time \\\\( t < T \\\\) assuming no intervention was used?",
  "Explanation": "Given that no modification (like matrix multiplication) has been applied, and knowing the continuous and deterministic nature of the integral transformation, we can accurately trace back and compute \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for any \\\\( t < T \\\\) using the inverse of the integral transformation if necessary.",
