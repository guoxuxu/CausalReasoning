  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant complex frequency. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied, resulting in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf the only observed data is the non-zero spectrum at \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\) from the Fourier transform, can we definitively conclude that the phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a non-zero value at \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\) indicates that the original function contains the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). However, from this information alone, we cannot ascertain whether a phase shift was applied, as the spectrum does not provide direct insights into phase changes without additional phase-specific data.",
