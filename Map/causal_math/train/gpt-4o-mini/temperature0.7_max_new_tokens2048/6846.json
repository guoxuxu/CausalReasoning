  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, D are constants. The system is subjected to a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing a frequency.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "As the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) affects the phase of the initial state, without knowledge of this application, one cannot accurately trace back to determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The rotation in the complex plane induced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) may result in multiple potential initial states that could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
