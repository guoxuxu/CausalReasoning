  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the set of complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\), and let's consider an integral transformation of this function, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the squared function, can we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the Fourier transform of the squared function doesn't provide a direct means to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\), since multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can lead to the same squared value due to the periodic and non-injective nature of squaring complex numbers.",
