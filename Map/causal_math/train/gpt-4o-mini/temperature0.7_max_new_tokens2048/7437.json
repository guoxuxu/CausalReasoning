  "Problem": "Let's examine a scenario involving a complex function and its transformation using a Fourier Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a frequency. We analyze the effect of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) and analyzed in the frequency domain without further intervention, does \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) exhibit delta-function behavior at \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier Transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) directly results in a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0) \\\\) at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\). This is due to the property that the Fourier Transform of an exponential function with a purely imaginary exponent results in a delta function centered at the frequency of the exponent.",
