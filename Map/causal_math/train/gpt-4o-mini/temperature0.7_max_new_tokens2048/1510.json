  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H \\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is the Hamiltonian operator. We examine the effect of a unitary transformation \\\\(U(t) = e^{-i At}\\\\) on the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a Hermitian operator.\n\nCan we determine the initial state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately trace back the original state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) as the transformation could have altered the state in a pivotal way that is not deducible from the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) alone, especially if \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(H\\\\) do not commute.",
