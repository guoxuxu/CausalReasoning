  "Problem": "Imagine an electrical RLC circuit with a voltage source described by a sinusoidal function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the amplitude, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The response of the circuit is analytically described by the Laplace transform of the voltage across different circuit elements.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at steady-state, can we infer the original angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the sinusoidal voltage source without additional information about the circuit configuration?",
  "Explanation": "The information provided by the steady-state current's Laplace transform does not uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without knowing circuit parameters like resistances, inductance, and capacitance, as these parameters affect the relationship between \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and \\\\( I(s) \\\\).",
