  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix. To examine causal inference, we analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be unequivocally inferred if it is unknown whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation on the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the potential modification of the initial condition by \\\\(S\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) makes it impossible to backtrack uniquely to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The matrix transformation can encode or disguise original values in a manner that cannot be simply reversed based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
