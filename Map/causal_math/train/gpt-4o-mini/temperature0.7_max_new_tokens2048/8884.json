  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic economic model governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where x and u denote state and control vectors respectively, and A and B are constant matrices. We observe the effect of input changes via the transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = Cu \\\\) for some constant matrix C.\n\nGiven observation of the state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to identify precisely at what times (if any) transformations such as \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Specific timing and type of transformations applied cannot be uniquely determined from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) since combined effects and multiple potential control strategies (transformations) can yield the same state vector. Overlap and linear dependency contribute to the indeterminacy.",
