  "Problem": "We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), on its related differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nAssuming that at time t = 0 some specific filtering process defined by a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied and later at t = t1 an additional function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) which modulates the signal, will the Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) be affected solely by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\) and retain traces of the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the additional transformations \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) introduces new elements into the system, influencing the final state \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\). These interventions alter the frequency content and distribution, making the outcome depend not only on the original differential equation but also on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
