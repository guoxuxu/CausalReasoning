  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), utilized in the context of a linear transformation in the complex plane over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The evolution of a complex function \\( g(z) = az + b \\) follows, where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven the output \\( z(T) \\) from \\( f(z) \\) followed by \\( g(z) \\), can we determine the original number \\( z_0 \\) without knowing \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\( \\omega \\) and hence the exact form of \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\), it's impossible to reverse the rotational transformation accurately. The phase shift introduced by \\( \\omega \\) is essential to trace back correctly to \\( z_0 \\), making it uncertain without that data.",
