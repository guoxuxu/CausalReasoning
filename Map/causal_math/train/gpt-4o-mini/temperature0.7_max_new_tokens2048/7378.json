  "Problem": "Consider a system is modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t) + ig(t) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. Integral operator \\\\( K \\\\) defined by \\\\( K[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during its evolution.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( K[z](T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) assuming no further knowledge except \\\\( K \\\\) and the output at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( K[z](T) \\\\) is the cumulative effect of all states from the interval [0, T]. Multiple initial conditions can lead to the same output at time T due to the nature of integral operators smoothing out over time. Without additional constraints or data on the system's evolution, the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
