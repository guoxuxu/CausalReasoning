  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and is then evolved according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) modifies the initial state by scaling \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and the factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) introduces an exponential growth or decay depending on the real part of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). Therefore, the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) changes, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any subsequent time will not be the same as without the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
