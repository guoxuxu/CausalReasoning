  "Problem": "Consider the complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). Investigate the effects of a transformation by matrix \\( M \\) where \\( M \\) effects the amplitude and frequency. The transformed variable is \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\). Let's analyze using variable separation and integral transformations.\n\nIf at a random time t = t1, a new intervention by a matrix \\( N \\) is applied yielding \\( u(t) = N w(t) \\), will the result \\( u(T) \\), for T > t1, depend solely on the original \\( \\omega \\) and not on the characteristics of \\( M \\) or \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) influence the result due to their potential to alter amplitude, frequency, and phase. The end state \\( u(T) \\) depends on the combination of these transformations alongside \\( \\omega \\), complicating prediction and dependency on just \\( \\omega \\).",
