  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We evaluate its behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 = 0 \\\\) purely by observing the transformed function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the cubing transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to distinguish if the observed dynamics arose from a naturally evolving \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) or a modified initial condition \\\\( e^{3iwt_0} \\\\). The process is not reversible without additional information on transformations applied.",
