  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane dynamics described by the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ u(t) \\} = U(s) \\) of a temporal function \\( u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\). We study the effect of a convolution operator defined by \\( h(t) \\) over the signal \\( u(t) \\), resulting in \\( v(t) = (h * u)(t) \\).\n\nGiven \\( W(s) \\) observed at some endpoint, can we determine what specific type or sequence of interventions (whether by \\( h(t) \\), \\( g(t) \\), or both) was used, just by knowing \\( W(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( W(s) \\) being a product of multiple Laplace transforms (i.e., \\( W(s) = G(s)H(s)U(s) \\)) means that different combinations of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) could yield the same \\( W(s) \\). Therefore, it's impossible to uniquely backtrace the exact interventions or their sequence solely from \\( W(s) \\).",
