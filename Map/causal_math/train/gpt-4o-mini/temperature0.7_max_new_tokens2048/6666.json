  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices defining separate dynamical systems for the real and imaginary parts, respectively. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we recover the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) precisely at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to ascertain the original state because the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could have altered both the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), thereby obscuring its true starting conditions.",
