  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, defined as \\\\( Lf = \\\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\\\. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is used to analyze the system.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) of an intervened function \\\\( g(x) = f(x) + h(x) \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) was applied before adding \\\\( h(x) \\\\), can we distinctly identify the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(x) \\\\) only from \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) details the effects of both \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) under the operator \\\\( L \\\\), disentangling these effects to uniquely recover \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) alone is not straightforward without additional constraints or knowledge about the forms or properties of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
