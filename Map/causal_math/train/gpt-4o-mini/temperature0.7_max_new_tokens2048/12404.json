  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and its effect on a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = f(t) \\\\). Assume all functions involved are sufficiently smooth and decay at infinity for the Fourier transform to exist.\n\nIf the input function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), and this transform is then used to study the differential equation without further transformation, does the transformed equation \\\\( s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s) \\\\) remain valid where \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) are the Fourier transforms of \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( f \\\\), respectively?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform linearly transforms the differential equation to the frequency domain. Given the properties of the Fourier transform on derivatives, the transformed equation remains valid and can be used directly to solve for \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in terms of \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
