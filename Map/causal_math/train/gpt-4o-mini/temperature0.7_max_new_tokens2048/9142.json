  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^te^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan the original function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be reconstructed precisely after observing the result of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) alone, without the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\), is insufficient to uniquely reconstruct the original function since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is an integral that encompasses all prior states, potentially with multiple combinations leading to the same result.",
