  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nCan we reconstruct the pure function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) accurately at any instant from 0 to T solely from its transformed version \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without knowing S?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the factor \\\\( S \\\\) used in the transformation, the direct relationship between \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at any point and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be definitely reverse engineered due to the loss of information caused by the integration process across the exponential modification.",
