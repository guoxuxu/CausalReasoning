  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an inductor L and resistor R in series connected to an alternating voltage source given by \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The voltage across the inductor is described by the equation \\\\( V_L = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} \\\\) and the resistor by \\\\( V_R = RI \\\\). We study the effect of altering the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the source on the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) in the circuit.\n\nIf a shunt capacitor C is added across the circuit as an intervention, and the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is increased, will the resonant frequency of the circuit shift?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a capacitor introduces a capacitive reactance \\\\( X_C = 1/(\\\\omega C) \\\\), forming an LRC circuit. The resonant frequency of such a circuit is determined by \\\\( \\\\omega_0 = 1/\\\\sqrt{LC} \\\\). Changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or adding C shifts this resonant frequency, altering the system's behavior at particular frequencies.",
