  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the temperature distribution in a rod is given by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), representing the heat equation with diffusion coefficient k. To study the influence of surface coatings, a transformation represented by \\\\(u(x,0) = e^{-ax^2}\\\\) is applied at the initial time, where a is a constant.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a cooling effect represented by \\\\(u(x,t_1) = u(x,t_1) e^{-bx}\\\\) where b is a constant, is applied as an intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original diffusion coefficient k and not on a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the cooling effect introduces a new variable b that modifies the temperature profile additionally at time \\\\(t_1\\\\). This, combined with the initial non-uniform profile induced by a, influences the entire future evolution of the temperature, making it dependent on a, b, and k.",
