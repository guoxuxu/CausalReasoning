  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, under the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\). The transformation is considered at two intervals: initially at time t = 0 and after applying an intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\).\n\nGiven the final frequency spectrum at t = T of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where you observe a peak at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can you conclusively state that the initial function at t = 0 was \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a peak at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the spectrum at t = T only indicates the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) at that time; it does not uniquely confirm that the initial state was exactly \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). Other functions or initial conditions might evolve to the same spectrum at t = T.",
