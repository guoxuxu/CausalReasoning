  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system dynamics are further influenced by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) without further intervention, will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will alter the initial system state to \\\\( z_0^m \\\\). As \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) is affected by the initial conditions, the resulting state \\\\( z(T) = e^{kmT}z_0^m \\\\) will not match the state obtained by direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without transformation, which would have been \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\). The exponentiation changes the trajectory uniquely depending on the initial state.",
