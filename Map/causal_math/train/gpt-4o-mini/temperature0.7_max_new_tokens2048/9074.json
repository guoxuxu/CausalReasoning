  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without definitive knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely reconstructed. The scaling factor introduced by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) complicates back-calculations, as it leaves ambiguity in determining whether and how \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was scaled.",
