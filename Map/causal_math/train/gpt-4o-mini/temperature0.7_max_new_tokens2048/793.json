  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to the variable z in the complex plane over time t, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied without further intervention, will \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\) at t = T be the same as applying \\\\( f \\\\) directly to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) for any z in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial value to \\\\( e^{iz_0} \\\\). So, \\\\( f(g(z_0)) = (e^{iz_0})^2 = e^{i2z_0} \\\\), which differs generally from \\\\( f(z_0) = z_0^2 \\\\) due to the exponential and trigonometric nature of the transformation, affecting the magnitude and phase.",
