  "Problem": "Consider the application of complex function mapping \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{z} \\\\) in the complex plane and its implications on the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\) defined for \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\\\). The Laplace transform is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the transformed output \\\\( F(w) \\\\) where \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\), can we correctly infer the original Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without any reconstructive transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\) effectively changes the domain of definition for the Laplace transform, making it non-trivial and generally impossible to reconstruct \\\\( F(s) \\\\) directly from \\\\( F(w) \\\\) without additional information or reverse transformation.",
