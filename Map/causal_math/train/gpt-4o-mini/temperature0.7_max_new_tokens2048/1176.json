  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly what transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both) were applied at earlier times solely from \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integration and exponential manipulations involving constants A, B, and C, the endpoints could align under various combinations of transformations, obscuring the exact historical sequence of interventions applied to the system.",
