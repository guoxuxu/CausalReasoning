  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{t} + a u_{x} = 0 \\\\) where a is a constant. Let's explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t)) \\\\) on this equation over time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what filtering operation was used at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), just from understanding the dynamics defined by a?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform does not change the dependency on the parameter a, and the effect of the filtering operation could overlap with natural evolution under \\\\( ia\\\\xi \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely resolve the specific filtering applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) based on the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) alone.",
