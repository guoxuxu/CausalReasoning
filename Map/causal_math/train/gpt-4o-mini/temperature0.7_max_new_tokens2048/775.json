  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), in which z is a complex variable, A is a real number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The transformation applies to study the effect of rotations in the complex plane under different time transformations.\n\nAssuming an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) which modifies A to B in the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iBt}z(t_1) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on B for \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), ignoring earlier values?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 will be affected by both the initial phase rotation determined by A up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the subsequent modification to B from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. It is thus dependent on both parameters, A and B, reflecting compounded rotational effects.",
