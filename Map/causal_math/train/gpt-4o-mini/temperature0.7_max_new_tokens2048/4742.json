  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied where s is a complex number.\n\nAfter observing the transformed output \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing the exact nature of the differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time with an exponential function that can obscure the specifics of how \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolve individually. Without explicit knowledge of the coefficients A, B, C, and D in the differential equations, reconstructing \\\\( z(0) \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) is not possible.",
