  "Problem": "Let's consider a function \\( z = h(x, y) \\) given by \\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\) in a two-dimensional space. We examine the role of a Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), applied to \\( h(x, y) \\) defined by \\( H(u, v) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(u, v) \\) and analyze its effect in the frequency domain.\n\nKnowing a function \\( q(x, y) \\) derived from \\( h(x, y) \\) through subsequent transformations and manipulations, can we determine the precise nature of interventions (like specific Fourier transform settings or filter applications) only by examining \\( q(x, y) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( q(x, y) \\) could potentially result from various combinations of transformations and filtering processes. The possible overlap in effects due to different intervention settings and lack of transparent information about initial conditions and operations makes it impossible to uniquely identify which interventions were applied to achieve \\( q(x, y) \\).",
