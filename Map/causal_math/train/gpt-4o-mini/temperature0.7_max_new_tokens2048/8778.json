  "Problem": "Let \\\\(f(z) = z^n\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(n\\\\) is a positive integer, define a transformation in the complex plane. Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\lambda z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant with a non-zero real part, describing an exponential decay or growth depending on the sign of the real part of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\). We aim to analyze how applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) affects the solutions over time.\n\nAfter observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we recover the original \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(z) = z^n\\\\) was initially applied, determining the exact \\\\(z_0\\\\) becomes ambiguous. Multiple possible values of \\\\(z_0\\\\) could lead to the same observed endpoint under different scenarios concerning the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",
