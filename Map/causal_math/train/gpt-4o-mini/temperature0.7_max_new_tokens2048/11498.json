  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where an input signal \\( x(t) \\) is passed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution with an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). The transformed signal \\( y(t) \\) is then subjected to a Fourier transform, generating \\( Y(\\omega) \\).\n\nCan we precisely recover the input signal \\( x(t) \\) from the frequency spectrum \\( Y(\\omega) \\) without knowing the impulse response \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\( x(t) \\) from \\( Y(\\omega) \\) requires knowledge of \\( H(\\omega) \\), the Fourier transform of the impulse response \\( h(t) \\). Without \\( H(\\omega) \\), it is impossible to correctly invert \\( Y(\\omega) \\) back to \\( x(t) \\) since \\( Y(\\omega) = X(\\omega)H(\\omega) \\).",
