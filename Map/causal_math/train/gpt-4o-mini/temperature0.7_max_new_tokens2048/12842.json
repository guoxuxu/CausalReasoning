  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its integration along a path in the complex plane. Analyze the influence of deforming the integration path from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = 1 + i \\\\) using two different paths, a straight line (path A) and a semicircle in the upper half-plane centered at \\\\( z = 0.5 + 0.5i \\\\) with radius 0.5 (path B).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( g(z) = z e^{z} \\\\) at some point along either path, will the final integral value still be reliant solely on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the function form midway, introducing a new variable (z) into the integrand. This change fundamentally affects the resulting integral's value as the new function and the original no longer share the same properties or potential singularities.",
