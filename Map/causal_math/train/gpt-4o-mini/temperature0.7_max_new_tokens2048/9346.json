  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and its inverse operation.\n\nIf we observe the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) along the rod at some time T, can the initial distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be precisely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the reversible nature of the Fourier transform and its application to solving linear partial differential equations like the heat equation, it is possible to precisely trace back to the initial temperature distribution from the observed data at time T.",
