  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift operator \\\\( P(z) = z(t)e^{iBt} \\\\) (where B is a real constant) is applied after the initial Fourier transform and before the system evolves naturally, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the phase shift operator adds another dimension to the system's evolution. The final function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) comprehensively depends on both the original system parameter \\\\( A \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( B \\\\). The interaction between these two influences the complex rotation and amplitude modulation of the function throughout its evolution.",
