  "Problem": "Investigate the scenario where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{Cx} \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is integrated into the dynamic determined by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\), D being another constant matrix. Analyze the evolution when the transformation \\\\( g(x) = z(x) * u(x) \\\\) is introduced.\n\nIs it possible to precisely infer the original vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at x = 0 from knowing \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = X, without awareness if the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was ever applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) enormously complicates back-calculating to \\\\( u_0 \\\\), as the transformation can distort the initial condition in such a way that it cannot be uniquely restored, especially if C and D do not commute.",
