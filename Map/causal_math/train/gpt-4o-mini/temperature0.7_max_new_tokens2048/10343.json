  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = f(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time and solve the integral equations \\\\( x(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)}g(x(s)) ds \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}h(y(s)) ds \\\\). We will analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( Tz = Cz \\\\) at different points in time.\n\nIf we introduce a new transformation \\\\( Dx \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), and allow the system to evolve to \\\\( T \\\\), will the structure of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( h(y) \\\\) alone determine \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention \\\\( Dx \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified, thereby affecting the composite output \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the final state will depend on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and the nature of the intervention \\\\( Dx \\\\), not just \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( h(y) \\\\).",
