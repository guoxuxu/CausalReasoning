  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is the speed of sound in a medium. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} u(t) dt \\\\), on the transformation of the equation.\n\nUsing the solution of the transformed differential equation in the frequency domain, can we exactly reconstruct the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Using the inverse Fourier transform on the frequency domain solution, we can accurately reconstruct \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at any time, including at t = 0. The Fourier transformation and its inverse are designed to be reversible, allowing precise reconstruction from the frequency to time domain.",
