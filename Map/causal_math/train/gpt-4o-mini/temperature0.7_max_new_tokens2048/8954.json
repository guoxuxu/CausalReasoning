  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) is applied to a complex variable z, where A is a complex constant. The effect of this transformation over time, modeled by \\\\( z(t) = f(z(t-1)) \\\\\\), is assessed with and without interventions.\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which forms a spiral, can we confirm that the series of transformations started with \\\\( z_0 = 0 \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory forming a spiral could start from any z on the complex plane, not necessarily from zero. The initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) does not uniquely determine the spiraling behavior since any non-zero \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can lead to a spiral pattern under repeated applications of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
