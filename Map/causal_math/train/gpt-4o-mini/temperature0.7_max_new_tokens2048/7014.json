  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit represented by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the frequency complex variable, and circuit behavior is regulated by this impedance function. The circuit undergoes a Fourier transformation which impacts the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan the original impedance function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be uniquely determined after observing the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) for some duration T without any further information about the original signal or interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and bijective nature of the Fourier transformation in LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) systems, and the use of an impulse signal, the original impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) can be precisely determined by the Fourier transform of the observed response \\\\( R(t) \\\\), under the assumption that no external intervention has altered the signal or the system.",
