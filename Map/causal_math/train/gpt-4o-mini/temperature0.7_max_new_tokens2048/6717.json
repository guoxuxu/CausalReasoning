  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the causal relationships when manipulating the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and analyzing its impact on the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using different transformations.\n\nIf an input function \\\\( x(t) = t \\\\) is directly applied into the integral transformation without any modifications, will the resultant output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) uniquely determine \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from 0 to t?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation via integral over time compresses multiple possible inputs into a single output state, thus information about specific aspects of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could be lost due to integration over the complex exponential, which does not uniquely encode all properties of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
