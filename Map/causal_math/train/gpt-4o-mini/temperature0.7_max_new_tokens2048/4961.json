  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. The system's state evolution is evaluated under the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) evolves naturally without intervention through the system, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) at time t = T equal the transform of the circle traced out by \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a function like \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), which traces the unit circle, is a Dirac delta function centered at frequency 1. Since the transformation is a linear operator and the input function is periodic with a frequency of 1, the Fourier transform at any time T where T is an integer multiple of the period will yield the same result.",
