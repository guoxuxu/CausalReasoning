  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a transformation via a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) on a complex plane where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. Consider the system's change over time if it is described by the flow \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of \\\\( w(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to conclusively determine if the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) was applied. The trajectory influenced by \\\\( k \\\\) can achieve similar outcomes at \\\\( T \\\\) from different initial conditions owing to the rotational symmetry and exponential growth characteristics of the complex plane dynamics.",
