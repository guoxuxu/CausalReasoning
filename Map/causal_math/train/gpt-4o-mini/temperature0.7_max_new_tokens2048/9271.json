  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 u = f(x, y)\\\\) on a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) with boundary conditions applied. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to analyze the effects and causal relationships of applying different boundary interventions.\n\nIf a specific contouring boundary condition is applied halfway through the time interval, altering the domain boundary shape or type at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final solution \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) depend solely on the change in the source term from \\\\(f_1\\\\) to \\\\(f_2\\\\) and not consider the new boundary adjustment?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention, by altering boundary conditions, significantly affects the outcome. The solution to the Poisson equation depends both on the source term and on the boundary conditions; any alteration in the boundary during the solution process will inherently affect the resultant field at time T, altering the effects from only source term modifications.",
