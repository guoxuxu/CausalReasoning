  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation via a linear operator represented by an integral transformation \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\int h(t - \\tau)f(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response function. The output after transformation is denoted \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is altered by adding a distortion effect represented as \\\\( g(t) = x(t) + \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) and processed without any other interventions, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as processing the unaltered signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) alters the input signal and consequently the output due to the linear nature of \\\\( T[f(t)] \\\\). The transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) will yield a different output involving the integral transform of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\), thus changing the system's response.",
