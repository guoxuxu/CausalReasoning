  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nDoes applying the operator \\\\( D \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before performing the Fourier Transform yield the same result as applying the Fourier Transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) first and then multiplying by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In Fourier Transform theory, differentiating a function in the time domain is equivalent to multiplying its Fourier Transform by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) in the frequency domain due to the properties of the Fourier Transform of derivatives. Hence, applying \\\\( D \\\\) first and then transforming yields the same result as transforming first and then multiplying by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
