  "Problem": "In a system analyzed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator, examine the impact of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nHaving observed the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely deduce the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of any transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Provided there are no transformations changing the initial state, and assuming no information loss through evolution, the inverse Fourier transform can be used to uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from its state at any later time, due to the reversible nature of the Fourier transform paired with the linear evolution.",
