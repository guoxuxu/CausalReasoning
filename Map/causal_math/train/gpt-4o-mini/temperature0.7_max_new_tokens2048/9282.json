  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + pu_x = 0 \\\\), with p being a constant. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx}u(x,t) dx \\\\), to the function u(x, t).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), can we infer the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing that the Fourier transform was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion of the Fourier transform from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) requires the knowledge of its initial application. Without knowing the evolutionary dynamics under the Fourier transform, pinpointing the exact initial condition from the effect at time T alone is not feasible, as phase information might be crucial.",
