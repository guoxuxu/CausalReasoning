  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the eigenvalues of the final transformed matrix after applying both \\\\( T(A) \\\\) and \\\\( S(A) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the transformations used (e.g., the specific matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the eigenvalues alone does not provide information about the specific matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) used in the transformations, because many different matrices can be used to achieve the same eigenvalue-preserving similarity transformation. The specific form of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined solely from the eigenvalues of the output matrix.",
