  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = te^{-t} \\\\). We further explore the role of inverse transformations and additional operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(F(s)\\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\) and is then subjected to the inverse Laplace transform without any further manipulations, will the resulting time function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) be equivalent to the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) simply scaled by a constant factor?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain corresponds to a differentiation in the time domain, specifically \\\\( g(t) = -tf(t) - f(t) \\\\), which is not merely a scaling of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). This modifies the structure of the original function.",
