  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nGiven the recorded state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions occurred (e.g., \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of interventions and the initial conditions. Effects of transformations like \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can overlap or counteract in ways that make it impossible to decipher the specific transformations applied only from knowing the end state.",
