  "Problem": "Study a system governed by \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants, and consider the integration through a transform \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) applied to the variable \\( z = x + iy \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nAfter observing \\( T(z) \\) to satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), can we confirm if the original \\( z \\) did also satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The cubic transformation can map a variety of \\( z \\) values that do not originally satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\) into ones that do. Thus, observing that \\( T(z) \\) satisfies the equation does not guarantee the original \\( z \\) also did.",
