  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) passed through an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described by the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-(t-s)^2} \\\\), such that the transformed function is \\\\( Tz(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(t, s) z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) be precisely inferred from the transformed function \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\) without any additional information about the transformation or function?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of how the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) and the functional form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) interact, it is generally not feasible to uniquely and accurately determine \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\) alone due to the transformation's potential to alter or obscure frequency components.",
