  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed using \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to analyze its behavior over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) effectively scales the magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), altering its amplitude evolution under the differential equation. The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ in magnitude compared to the untransformed case, even though the angular frequency remains unchanged.",
