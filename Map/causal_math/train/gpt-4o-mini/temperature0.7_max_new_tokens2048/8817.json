  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system described by a Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) defined as \\\\(f(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(s) e^{ist} ds\\\\). The scenario explores how manipulations to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) affect the outcome of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over an interval.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is modified such that it includes a polynomial term, \\\\( p(s) \\\\), without any other intervention, will the resulting function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) demonstrate changes in its amplitude and phase at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a polynomial term to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) influences both the amplitude and oscillatory behavior of the Fourier transform, thus modifying the resultant function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in both amplitude and phase compared to the Fourier transform of the original \\\\( g(s) \\\\).",
