  "Problem": "Consider a functional space where functions are transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\), which represents the Laplace transform. The initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and its transform are studied over different conditions and manipulations of variable x.\n\nKnowing the result of the Laplace transform of some function at x, and knowing that an intervention in the form of a function additive was applied, can we determine both the original function and the intervention function uniquely?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linear properties of the Laplace transform, multiple combinations of original functions and interventions (additive modifications) might yield the same transform result. Additional information about either the initial function or the intervention is required to uniquely determine both components.",
