  "Problem": "Consider the discrete-time system defined by the equation \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Bx\\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing only the matrix A and the final state \\\\(y(N)\\\\) at n = N, can we precisely determine the sequence and types of interventions applied (\\\\(g(y)\\\\) at n = 0 and \\\\(h(y)\\\\) at n = 1) directly from \\\\(y(N)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interplay between the transformations due to B and C and the repetitive application of A can yield similar end states that are not distinguishable solely based on \\\\(y(N)\\\\). Multiple intervention sequences could result in the same end state depending on how matrices B, C, and A interact. Hence, without explicit information about B and C, the exact sequence of interventions cannot be uniquely determined.",
