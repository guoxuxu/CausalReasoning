  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the complex initial condition. We evaluate how the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant, affects the evolution over time.\n\nCan the exact interventions (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) used be determined conclusively based only on the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and potential overlap of effects from the exponential transformations \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\), multiple combinations of interventions can lead to the same observed state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, one cannot uniquely identify the interventions used solely from the endpoint.",
