  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( x(T) \\), can we accurately determine which transformations were used (whether \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both) just by knowing the state at \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( x(T) \\) could be reached via various paths involving different combinations or sequences of interventions \\( g(x) \\) and \\( h(x) \\). The non-trivial interaction between these transformations and the dynamics dictated by K makes it challenging to uniquely trace back the interventions used.",
