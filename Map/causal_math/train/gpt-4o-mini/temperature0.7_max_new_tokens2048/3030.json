  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency. We assess the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega s}f(s)ds \\\\) over an interval.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be reconstructed uniquely from the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without additional data or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation integral \\\\( T \\\\) effectively erases phase information about \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and incorporates the whole history of the function over an interval into a single result. As such, critical information about the exact state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at specific times is lost, preventing unique reconstruction of the original function just from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\).",
