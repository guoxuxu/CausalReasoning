  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate how the application of a convolution transformation defined by kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with its Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the convolution \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{(g \\\\ast h)(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) separately without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The product form \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\) alone does not allow for the unique decomposition into \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) unless further information about one of the functions is known. Multiple function pairs can yield the same product, leading to intrinsic ambiguity in inferring the original functions solely based on their product.",
