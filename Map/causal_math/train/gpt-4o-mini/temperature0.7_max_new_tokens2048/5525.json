  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the consequences of applying a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( Mz = az + b \\\\), with \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) being complex numbers.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to obtain a new state \\\\( Mz_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will the state at time T, denoted as \\\\( z(T) \\\\), be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( M \\\\) modifies the initial state and therefore changes the trajectory of the system. The linear transformation introduces a shift and scaling that affects how the state evolves over time under the influences of \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\), resulting in a different final state at any time T.",
