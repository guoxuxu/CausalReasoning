  "Problem": "Consider a heat conduction process governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( u_t \\) and \\( u_{xx} \\) denote the temporal and spatial second derivatives of \\( u \\) respectively, and \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The initial condition is \\( u(x, 0) = \\phi(x) \\). Analysis involves examining the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(s, t) \\) applied at t = 0.\n\nCan we reconstruct \\( \\phi(x) \\) perfectly from \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\) at t = T if no additional information is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\), the Fourier inversion theorem allows the exact reconstruction of \\( u(x, T) \\), and since the solution depends linearly on \\( \\phi(x) \\), \\( \\phi(x) \\) can be determined from \\( u(x, T) \\) given the boundary and initial conditions.",
