  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are constants. We will explore the effects of applying the transformation defined by \\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(z) = e^{mt}z \\) (where \\( m \\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( k \\) or \\( m \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) is influenced by the combined effects of the original equation parameters (\\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\)), as well as the transformations \\( e^{kt} \\) and \\( e^{mt} \\). These transformations alter the magnitude and phase of \\( z \\) at different instances, impacting the trajectory and outcome.",
