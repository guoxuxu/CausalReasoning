  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^2 \\\\) defined over the complex numbers, and let \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z e^{w^2} dw \\\\) be an integral transformation. Investigate the implications of this setup where \\\\( z \\\\) evolves as a complex function.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z \\\\) is initially set to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and later modified to \\\\( z_1 = z_0 + h \\\\) (where \\\\( h \\\\) is a non-zero real number) as an intervention, will the resulting \\\\( g(z_1) \\\\) be independent of the original function form \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\), but since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) computes an exponential integral that deeply depends on the squared value from \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(z_1) \\\\) will not be independent of the original squaring function. The transformed input still relies on the output of \\\\( f(x) \\\\).",
