  "Problem": "Let's consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time in the complex plane. We investigate the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to definitively conclude whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Observing just the end value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not allow us to definitively trace back whether the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied because both \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{2it} \\\\) could potentially produce the same observed output for specific values of \\\\( T \\\\), such as multiples of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\).",
