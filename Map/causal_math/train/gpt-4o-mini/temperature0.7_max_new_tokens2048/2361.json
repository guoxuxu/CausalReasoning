  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a time-dependent state in a system. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) is applied to the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve following the original definition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further interventions, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the state evolved naturally from t = 0 to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system by integrating the past states, thus affecting the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This results in a different state at time T from just evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) dictates the rate of change and phase.",
