  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), representing a rotating vector in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( w \\\\). The effect of an external transformation is considered using the operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) with \\\\( a \\\\) being a constant.\n\nCan you infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the external transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is confounded by the unknown application of \\\\( L \\\\). The transformation could have altered the original magnitude and phase, implying that without explicit knowledge of \\\\( L's \\\\) application, multiple feasible \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could correspond to the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
