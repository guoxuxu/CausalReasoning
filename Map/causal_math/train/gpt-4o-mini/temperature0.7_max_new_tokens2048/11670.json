  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is first transformed via a Fourier transform, generating \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), and is then processed by a system with a frequency response function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). The output is \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and it undergoes an inverse Fourier transform to produce the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and knowing the frequency response \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we perfectly reconstruct the initial signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) would require an inverse operation that isn't necessarily unique if \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) includes zero or near-zero values, where signal information might be lost or distorted, making perfect reconstruction impossible without further information.",
