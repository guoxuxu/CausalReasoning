  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system described by a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Examine the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to follow \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the trajectory by taking a complex weighted integral of the original function over time, resulting in a function of \\\\( s \\\\). This transformation is non-trivial and permanently changes the representation and values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thereby affecting its state at any further time T.",
