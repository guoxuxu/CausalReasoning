  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) operating in the complex plane. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this function, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier spectrum showing a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), can we confirm that the original function was specifically \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Although a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\) in the Fourier spectrum strongly suggests that the original function had a frequency component of \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), it does not exclusively confirm that the function was \\\\( \\\\exp(ix) \\\\). Other phase shifts or amplitude variations could yield a similar result.",
