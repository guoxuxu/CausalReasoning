  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the original function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transformation into the complex s-plane. We study the effects of a convolution operation with a kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented by its transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf during the transformation process an additional scaling function \\\\( p(t) \\\\) with Laplace transform \\\\( P(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), modifying it to \\\\( r(t) = p(t) * h(t) \\\\), will the result \\\\( R(s) \\\\) be affected only by the scale transform \\\\( P(s) \\\\) and not by the original kernel \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transform \\\\( R(s) \\\\) will be affected by both the scaling function and the original kernel, as it is the product of the Laplace transformations of \\\\( p(t) \\\\), \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), namely \\\\( R(s) = P(s)F(s)G(s) \\\\).",
