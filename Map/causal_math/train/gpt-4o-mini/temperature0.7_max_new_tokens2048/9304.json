  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of the integral transform \\( g(z) = \\int e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven only the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) computed from \\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\delta)t} \\), can we definitively determine whether \\( \\delta \\) was applied and its exact value from \\( g(z) \\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Although \\( g(z) \\) reflects changes including \\( \\delta \\), distinguishing these changes from adjustments to \\( s \\) or the base frequency \\( \\omega \\) is complex without additional context or information. \\( g(z) \\) alone provides ambiguous readings that could suggest various combinations of parameters, not a definitive \\( \\delta \\).",
