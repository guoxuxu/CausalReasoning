  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze whether certain transformations can infer causal relationships or predict the system's behavior accurately.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) and knowing the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we uniquely determine the phase shifts \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) that were applied at t = 0 and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) respectively?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed result \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) could correspond to different combinations of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the function and the complex interaction between multiple phase shifts. Multiple scenarios may yield the same observation at time T.",
