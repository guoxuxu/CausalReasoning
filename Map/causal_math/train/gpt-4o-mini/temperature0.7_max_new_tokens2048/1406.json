  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on a region in the complex plane under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^t dt \\\\). Analyze the impact of this function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\)) at a specific \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)), can we determine the original path taken in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Since the value of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\)) is path-independent as long as the path does not enclose any singularities, and given that \\\\\\\\(( e^t \\\\\\\\)) has no singularities, any value of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\)) at \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) can be achieved via multiple paths, rendering it impossible to uniquely determine the path based only on the endpoint value.",
