  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a contour integral transformation on a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) by proposing the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin and t is a real-parameter.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) without any additional alteration, does the result depend solely on the initial function shape (i.e., \\\\( z^2 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation involves integrating \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\) along a set contour, the outcome is dictated by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) within the integral, which is \\\\( z^2 \\\\). No other factors influence this transformation's outcome, assuming the contour C and parameter t are fixed.",
