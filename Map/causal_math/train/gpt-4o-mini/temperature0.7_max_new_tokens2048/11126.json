  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), and given the effect of C on the initial condition, it becomes impossible to accurately trace back to \\( z_0 \\) solely based on the observed state at t = T, especially if A and C do not commute.",
