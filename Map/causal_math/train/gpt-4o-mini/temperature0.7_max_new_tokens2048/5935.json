  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) obey the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. We explore the scenario by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional perturbation \\\\( p(t) = e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\), with B being another real constant, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\) and we then look at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1, does the original governing equation still solely dictate the new state at T?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( p(t) \\\\) modifies the trajectory or state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) explicitly introducing another factor (B) into the dynamics. This alteration means that the original system described by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\) no longer exclusively controls the state evolution past \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
