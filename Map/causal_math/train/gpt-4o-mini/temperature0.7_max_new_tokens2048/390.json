  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant complex matrix. The evolution of this system is impacted by an integral transform \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Qt} z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex matrix and T is a fixed end time.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be determined uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the application of \\\\( H(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(T) = e^{PT} z_0 \\\\), the relationship between \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is unique and invertible as long as P has no zero eigenvalues, allowing us to compute \\\\( z_0 = e^{-PT} z(T) \\\\) irrespective of the integral transformation \\\\( H(z) \\\\).",
