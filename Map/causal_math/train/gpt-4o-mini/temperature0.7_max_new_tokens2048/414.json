  "Problem": "Consider a system following a complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sT} ds \\cdot x \\\\), where T is a constant matrix and x is a constant complex vector. The function \\\\( g(z) = Uz \\\\) is a unitary transformation applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where U is a constant unitary matrix.\n\nCan we uniquely recover \\\\( x \\\\) from knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of any interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and invertible nature of the integral transformation involving matrix exponentials of a constant matrix over time, and assuming no additional function has altered this path, it is possible to uniquely recover the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\).",
