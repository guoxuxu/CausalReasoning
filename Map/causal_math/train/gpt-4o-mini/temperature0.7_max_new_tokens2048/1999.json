  "Problem": "Analyze a hypothetical economic model where output \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) is described by \\\\( Q(t) = Ce^{kt} \\\\), where C is output at t=0, and k is a growth rate constant. The intervention is defined by a policy function \\\\( P(Q) = Qe^{rt} \\\\), with r being a policy-induced growth adjustment factor.\n\nIf a policy intervention \\\\( P(Q) \\\\) is applied part way through the time period, say at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( Q(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on the original growth rate k, and not on r?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the growth rate from k to a compounded rate involving both k and r. Hence, the final output is a result of both the inherent growth rate and the intervention-induced adjustment, affecting the output trajectory.",
