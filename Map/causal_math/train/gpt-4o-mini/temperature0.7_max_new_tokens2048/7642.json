  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact when subjected to a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega nT} \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The observed outcome \\\\( e^{i\\omega nT} \\\\) can arise both from direct evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega nt} \\\\) or via the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\) followed by evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). Without additional information, the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
