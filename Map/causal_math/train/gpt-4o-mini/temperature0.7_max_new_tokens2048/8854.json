  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the effects of applying the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the integral result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over [0,T], can we uniquely determine the initial values of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) based solely on this information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation results in an accumulation of values over the time interval and depends on the entire trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from 0 to T. Without a priori knowledge of the functional form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) or additional conditions, it is not possible to uniquely determine the initial values.",
