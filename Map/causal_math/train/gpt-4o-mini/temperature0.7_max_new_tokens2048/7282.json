  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) evolving under the dynamics described by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) is a complex constant. The impact of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Qt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is another complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nAfter observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we deduce the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), the transformation via \\\\(e^{Qt}\\\\) might have altered the initial conditions such that reconstructing the original \\\\(z_0\\\\) uniquely is infeasible, particularly given the complex nature of \\\\(Q\\\\) and \\\\(P\\\\).",
