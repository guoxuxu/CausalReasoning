  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the influence of Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing components of the complex signal over time t.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) is calculated without any additional manipulation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the transform adequately capture all the frequency components inherent in \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is designed to deconstruct a signal into its constituent frequency components, handling both real and imaginary parts, thus capturing the complete frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
