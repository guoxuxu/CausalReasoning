  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nIf an intervention occurs where an additional function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Fourier Transform be a simple addition of the Fourier Transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of the sum of two functions is the sum of their Fourier Transforms (linearity of the Fourier Transform). Hence, adding \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and then transforming the result will simply add the Fourier Transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to that of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier Transform of a function z(t) yields a frequency domain representation F(z)(ω). Applying the differential operator D, which represents differentiation with respect to time, directly affects the original time-domain signal z(t). When an additional function h(t) is added to z(t) at time t1, the Fourier Transform of the combined signal is the sum of the individual Fourier Transforms of z(t) and h(t), resulting in F(z + h)(ω) being equal to F(z)(ω) plus F(h)(ω).",
