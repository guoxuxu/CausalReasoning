  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a controlled mechanical system whose state variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves under the influence of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) as described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Lx + K u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input represented by a function and \\\\( K \\\\) is a constant matrix dictating the influence of \\\\( u \\\\) on the state \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( v(t) = cu(t) \\\\) for some constant \\\\( c \\\\) at t = 0 and maintained throughout the evolution, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T be proportional to the state that would have been reached with the original input \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the differential equation is linear with respect to both the state \\\\( x \\\\) and the control input \\\\( u \\\\), scaling the input by a constant factor \\\\( c \\\\) simply scales the entire solution for the state by \\\\( c \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will be directly proportional to what it would have been under \\\\( u(t) \\\\), scaled by \\\\( c \\\\).",
