  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is considered.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) is evolved according to the differential equation without further intervention by the transformation T, will \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) be equivalent to the transformation applied initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the differential equation is linear and the transformation T is a linear operator, applying the transformation at any point during the evolution under the differential equation will yield the same result as applying it initially, due to the time-invariance property.",
