  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} + i \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-1)s} ds \\\\), where A is a constant and i represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of z when affected by transformation \\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\), where B is another constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the given function without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be unchanged compared to directly applying the initial function to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation modifies the initial condition and the trajectory of the function. Since \\\\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\\\) scales and possibly rotates z, the final value at z(T) is altered by B and is not typically the same as simply evolving z(t) from t = 0 to t = T without the transformation.",
