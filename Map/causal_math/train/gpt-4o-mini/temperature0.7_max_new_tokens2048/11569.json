  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = L(h(t))  = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). We analyze the effect of modifying this system by convolution with another function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to form \\\\( y(t) = (h * g)(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural properties without further intervention, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), be the same as if \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was not convolved with \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) results in a transformed function whose Laplace transform is based on a product: \\\\( Y(s) = H(s-b) \\\\). This shift in the domain by \\\\( b \\\\) alters the characteristics of the transformed function, making it fundamentally different from \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
