  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\( \\phi(t) = e^{-at} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to add a factor \\( e^{-bt} \\) for \\( b > 0 \\) without further intervention, will the spectrum \\( z(w) \\) change from the original with only \\( a \\) involved?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the additional factor modifies the decay rate from \\( a \\) to \\( a + b \\), thus changing the spectrum \\( z(w) \\). This results in a modification to its exponential decay characteristics, thereby affecting the rate and form of the function's spectral decay.",
