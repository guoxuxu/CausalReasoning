  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az + B} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants. The model investigates the impact of the linear transformation and the complex function on a vector space over a field of complex numbers.\n\nBased on the final output vector obtained after successive applications of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we trace back uniquely to the original vector \\\\( v \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied first?",
  "Explanation": "Given the non-commutativity and the nonlinear nature of the complex exponential function, determining the order of application or even the original vector without explicit knowledge of the operations applied is generally not feasible. The transformations could fundamentally alter the vector space in ways that are not easily reversible.",
