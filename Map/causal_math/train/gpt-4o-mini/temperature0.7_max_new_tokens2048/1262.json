  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nBased on the spectrum \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) being a delta function at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), can we confirm that the original function was \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) without any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a single delta function in the Fourier transform \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) unambiguously points back to the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) being a pure exponential of the form \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), as other functions would introduce additional components or spread in the frequency domain.",
