  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse used in solving differential equations. Suppose \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) and the differential equation given is \\\\( y'' + 3y' + 2y = f(t) \\\\) with initial conditions \\\\( y(0) = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( y'(0) = 0 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the driving function of the differential equation, can the solution of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at any time t be derived using standard methods (like Laplace transforms) without additional external intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Using the Laplace transform, the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can be converted to \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{e^{2t}}{s-2} \\\\), from which the entire behavior of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) can be predicted by solving the transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\frac{F(s)}{s^2 + 3s + 2} \\\\) and then applying the inverse Laplace transform, following the convolution theorem.",
