  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) mapping real numbers to complex numbers. We explore the transformation driven by the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to this function resulting in \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), and analyze its impact under different conditions.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(h(t) = t\\\\cdot x(t)\\\\) is applied as an intervention before calculating the Fourier transform, will \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) reflect only the effects of the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and not the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) alters the function by adding a time-dependent scaling, which changes the derivative properties and consequently the Fourier transform. This results in a transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) that reflects both the original characteristics and the intervention.",
