  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. A linear transformation by a complex matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function, resulting in \\\\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and the system is allowed to evolve under the dynamics specified by \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as the trajectory of \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) directly computed for each t?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is linear and constant, and it commutes with the time evolution operator of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the trajectory \\\\( w(t) \\\\) will exactly follow \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) for all t, yielding the same trajectory when applied post-evolution.",
