  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We investigate the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\( M \\), which acts on the complex plane by the function \\( f(z) = Mz \\).\n\nGiven the output \\( g(f(z_0)) \\), can we determine precisely which matrix was used in the transformation \\( f \\), whether \\( M \\), \\( N \\), or both at different points?",
  "Explanation": "The final expression of \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) could potentially result from the application of either \\( M \\), \\( N \\), or both at different times or configurations due to the exponential function's properties and the potential overlaps or similar effects of \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). Identifying which matrix or matrices were used requires more precise information than just the output.",
