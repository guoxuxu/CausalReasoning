  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent electric field \\\\( E(t) \\\\) in a region, defined by \\\\( E(t) = E_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( E_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants. The response of a charged particle to this field is given by the differential equation \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} = qE(t) \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is the mass and \\\\( q \\\\) is the charge of the particle. We examine the impact of a damping force \\\\( -b\\\\dot{x} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a damping coefficient, introduced at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nIf the initial motion state \\\\( x(0), \\\\dot{x}(0) \\\\) of the particle is set, and it evolves purely under the influence of \\\\( E(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be identical if the damping force had never been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the damping force, the particle moves purely due to the oscillatory electric field, resulting in undamped oscillatory motion. The absence of damping allows greater amplitude for the motion as compared to when damping is present.",
