  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the temperature distribution over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the influence of a spatial transformation given by \\\\(g(x) = ax+b\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants, on this temperature distribution.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution at \\\\(t = T\\\\), is it possible to exactly trace back the original spatial coordinates without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the information on the application of the spatial transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\), it's impossible to accurately deduce the original spatial configuration of the rod as the transformation could have fundamentally altered the initial conditions.",
