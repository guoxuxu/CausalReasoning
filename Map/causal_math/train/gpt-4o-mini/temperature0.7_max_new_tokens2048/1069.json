  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position components in a temporal dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with A and B being complex numbers.\n\nIf the system is initially at a state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\) without any intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T solely depend on the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's evolution is influenced not only by the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) but also by the constant term B and the coefficient A. The term B acts as a driving force adding a complex adjustment at each instant, modifying the trajectory over time.",
