  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the function \\\\( p(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) represents the pressure at a point \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). The evolution of pressure is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 p \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Now, analyze the scenario under transformation given by the function \\\\( h(p) = e^{-kt} p \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( q(p) = e^{-mt}p \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another constant) is introduced as an intervention, does the outcome \\\\( p(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-mt} \\\\) during the evolution process alters the pressure profile further. This makes the final pressure distribution \\\\( p(x, T) \\\\) at time T dependent on the actual dynamics governed by D as well as both factors \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\), reflecting compounded exponential modifications.",
