  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We analyze the impact of integral transformations using convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\) over the real number line.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-t} \\\\) is introduced and convolved sequentially after \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will the resulting function after both convolutions depend solely on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any influence from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential convolution with both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) results in a series of transformations that modify the original function. The effects of each kernel are compounded, thereby influencing the final outcome, which will reflect characteristics of both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) as well as \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
