  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), applied to this function over variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), for all \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\), and the Laplace transform is applied thereafter, will the resulting transform function be independent of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification changes the behavior of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\), resulting in a piecewise function whose transform depends both on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) before \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and the adjusted \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) after. Therefore, the transform will reflect characteristics of both.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function g(z) produces the expression e^{iωz}, which is influenced by the variable ω. The function f(t) is determined by ω, and the Laplace transform of f(t) produces the result ℒ{f}(s). An increase in ω by δ at time t0 affects the value of f(t) for all t greater than t0, which subsequently alters the Laplace transform of f(t).",
