  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. The function describes the combined influence of two transformations on initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) begins with initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) without any intervention, will the outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\) be solely determined by the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the future state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is directly determined by \\\\( e^{AT}x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}y_0 \\\\). Since there's no intervention altering the terms, the role of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) in transforming their respective vectors dictates the state completely.",
