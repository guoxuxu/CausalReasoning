  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex growth rate. We are examining the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda s} z(s) ds \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nBased on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T, can we determine the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) used at t = 0 without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) potentially modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a way that cannot be precisely traced back without explicit knowledge of its application. The influences of both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), and their interaction through the transformation, obfuscate the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",
