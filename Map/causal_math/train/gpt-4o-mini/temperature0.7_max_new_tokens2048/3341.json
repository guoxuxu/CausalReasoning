  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature \\\\( T \\\\) affects the rate of a chemical reaction according to the Arrhenius equation, given by \\\\( R(T) = A e^{-\\\\frac{E}{RT}} \\\\), where \\\\( E \\\\) is the activation energy, \\\\( R \\\\) is the gas constant, and \\\\( A \\\\) is a pre-exponential factor. We need to also consider an intervention by adjusting the temperature profile over time with a function \\\\( f(t) = T_0 + kt \\\\), where \\\\( T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature and \\\\( k \\\\) is the rate of change of temperature.\n\nIf temperature \\\\( T \\\\) is set using a function \\\\( T = f(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and the reaction rate is then observed without further intervention, do changes in \\\\( k \\\\) directly determine the behavior of \\\\( R(T) \\\\) for all future times?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( R(T) \\\\) explicitly depends on \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( T \\\\) is defined by \\\\( f(t) = T_0 + kt \\\\), changes in the slope \\\\( k \\\\) will directly alter the temperature, which in turn directly affects the reaction rate \\\\( R(T) \\\\) at all future times following the Arrhenius equation.",
