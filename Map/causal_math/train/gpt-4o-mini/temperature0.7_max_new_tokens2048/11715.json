  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by A, B, and C. Each of these contributes a rotation to the complex number, and their combined effects will directly influence the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The impact of each transformation, especially since they involve different constants, changes the final outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
