  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nIf given the result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval [0, T] without prior knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation obscures the history of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through its integral effect, accumulating all prior values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) weighted by \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega s} \\\\). Without knowing the nature of these transformations, retracing to the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval is indeterminate.",
