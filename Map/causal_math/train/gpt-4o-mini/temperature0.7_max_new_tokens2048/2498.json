  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system governed by a vector field \\\\(V(z) = i\\\\beta z\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant. The transformation considered is \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, and t represents time.\n\nGiven the observed point \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original point \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied initially, it alters the magnitude and phase of \\\\(z_0\\\\). Without this knowledge, reconstructing the exact initial point is impossible because multiple initial conditions could yield the same final point dependent on the presence and parameters of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",
