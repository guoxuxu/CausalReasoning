  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\) in two dimensions, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential. The complex function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) is applied to the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), with \\\\( w \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the potential function \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) at a later time, can one determine exactly the sequence and types of boundary transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) applied?",
  "Explanation": "Several different sequences or types of transformations could yield the same potential function \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) due to the complex nature of the influences and the non-uniqueness of boundary condition imposition in such linear partial differential equations.",
