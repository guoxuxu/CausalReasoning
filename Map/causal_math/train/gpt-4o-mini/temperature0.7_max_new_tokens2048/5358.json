  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input that can be transformed using an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{F(s)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of a new input function. We study how transformations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) affect the system's behavior.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at a time T, can we determine whether the original input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or the transformed \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) was used, without any interventions or prior knowledge about the input's nature?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original control input strictly from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is generally impossible without additional data, due to potential non-uniqueness in producing the same state with different input functions, given that different inputs could potentially result in the same final state depending on the systems’s observability properties.",
