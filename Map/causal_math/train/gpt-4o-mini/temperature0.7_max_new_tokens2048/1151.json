  "Problem": "Assume a function defined on complex numbers \\\\(z\\\\) as \\\\(f(z) = e^{az}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. This function undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\) for \\\\(\\\\operatorname{Re}(s) > \\\\operatorname{Re}(a)\\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation on various scenarios.\n\nIf a modification is applied to the Laplace transform, changing it to \\\\(G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2}\\\\), and then inverted back to the time domain, does the resulting function depend only on \\\\(a\\\\) without influences from the original form of \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification to the transform changes the nature of the function from simple exponential to a multiplied-by-time exponential. The resulting function is influenced by both the original parameter \\\\(a\\\\) and the nature of the transformation applied, indicating dependency beyond the original \\\\(a\\\\).",
