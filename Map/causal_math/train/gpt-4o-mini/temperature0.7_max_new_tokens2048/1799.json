  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\), where V is the electric potential. A transformation under a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) (with \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) representing spatial variables) is applied.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega z} \\\\) is applied at a later time to the boundary conditions, will the resulting potential V within the domain depend solely on the second intervention and ignore effects from \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) does not reset or independently override the effects from the first transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Instead, it further modifies the boundary conditions already influenced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), resulting in a potential that reflects the cumulative effects of both transformations.",
