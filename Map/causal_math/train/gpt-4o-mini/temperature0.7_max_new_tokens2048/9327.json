  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. Analyze the causal influences when we alter \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a multiplier \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) we apply a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive real constant) as an intervention to the already modified function \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\), will the resulting transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) introduces an additional modification to the decay characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This change affects the integral by shifting the Laplace parameter \\\\( s \\\\) further to \\\\( s + \\\\alpha \\\\). Therefore, the resultant transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) definitely depends on the initial \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the intervention \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), as well as the original characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
