  "Problem": "Consider an integral operation on the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) within the contour integral along a closed curve \\\\( C \\\\. The transformation to be applied is \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) before executing the integral.\n\nGiven the outcome of the transformed contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{iz} z^2 dz \\\\), can we determine if the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) was applied starting purely from the integral result of \\\\( z^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the results of the contour integration alone do not necessarily indicate whether such a transformation was applied. Multiple transformations could yield similar integrals, complicating retroactive deduction of using just \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\).",
