  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation studied involves the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, does the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) match the original evolution of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) without using \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory from a simple exponential growth to one that integrates past states of the system due to the transformation's accumulating nature. This makes the new system trajectory different from the unaltered exponential evolution.",
