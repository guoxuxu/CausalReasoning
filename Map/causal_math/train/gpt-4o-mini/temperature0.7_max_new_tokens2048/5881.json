  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a circular path in the complex plane at a fixed radius of 1, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We examine the change in trajectory when this function is altered with a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is squared at t = 0, and then it evolves with the same \\\\( \\omega \\\\) for time T without further modification, will the function at t = T differ from that obtained by not squaring initially and evolving for time T?",
  "Explanation": "Squaring the function changes the frequency from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\omega \\\\) because \\\\( (e^{i\\omega t})^2 = e^{2i\\omega t} \\\\). This changes the speed at which the function traverses the circular path, influencing its position at any later time T compared to unsquared evolution.",
