  "Problem": "Consider a function h(z) defined over the complex plane, and let's apply a Fourier transform on this function, denoted as H(w), to analyze its behavior in frequency space.\n\nGiven only the modified inverse Fourier transform result after applying exp(-aw^2), can we determine both the original polynomial degree n and the value of a?",
  "Explanation": "While certain traits of the resulting function may hint at the degree or the convolution with a Gaussian, precisely identifying both the original polynomial degree n and the specific parameter a without additional information about the interference is generally not feasible due to the overlap of effects produced by each operation.",
