  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and its effect on a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = f(t) \\\\). Assume all functions involved are sufficiently smooth and decay at infinity for the Fourier transform to exist.\n\nGiven the frequency domain solution \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) solely based on the transformed differential equation \\\\( s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the transformed equation provides a relationship between \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(s) \\\\), solving for \\\\( F(s) \\\\) directly and then applying an inverse Fourier transform gives \\\\( f(t) \\\\), the knowledge about initial conditions \\\\( y(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y'(0) \\\\) is also crucial. Without them, \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) alone.",
