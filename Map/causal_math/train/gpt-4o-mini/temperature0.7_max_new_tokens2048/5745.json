  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) and transformations are applied as \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition to \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\). As \\\\( z(t) = z_0e^{it} \\\\) for the undisturbed system, transforming initially changes the trajectory to \\\\( z(t) = e^{kT}z_0e^{it} \\\\), differing from merely \\\\( z_0e^{it} \\\\).",
