  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and the function maps a real value \\\\(t\\\\) to a point on the complex unit circle. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Az\\\\), where A is a complex square matrix, at different times.\n\nIf an intervention applying a secondary linear transformation \\\\(g(z) = Bz\\\\) (where B is another complex matrix) is done at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the system at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) reflect an influence primarily from \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\), but not from \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) remains significant since it dictates the fundamental frequency of oscillation on the unit circle. The intervention with \\\\(B\\\\) on top of \\\\(A\\\\) does not eliminate or overshadow the underlying dynamics governed by e^{i\\\\omega t}, and hence the system's state is influenced by \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
