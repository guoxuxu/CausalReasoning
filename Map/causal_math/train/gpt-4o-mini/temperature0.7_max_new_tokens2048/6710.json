  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a transformation given by \\\\( g(u) = (Tf)(u) \\\\), where \\\\( Tf \\\\) represents a Fourier transform over a function f modifying u.\n\nGiven \\\\( u(t) \\\\) observed at t = T, can we deduce precisely whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 solely from this observation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) could have altered the frequency composition of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) in a way that is non-recoverable just by observing the resultant state at t = T under L, especially without additional information on the specifics of L relative to the Fourier components.",
