  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = {\\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sA} x(s) ds} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function defined by some physical or chemical process. We assess the effect of the linear operator \\\\( L(z) = Bz \\\\), with B being another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf we observe the system's state at some time t, can we conclusively infer the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if the operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( L \\\\) was applied, the transformation by B could significantly change the trajectory from its initial state. The lack of this knowledge precludes exact back-calculation of \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
