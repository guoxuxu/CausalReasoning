  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform in space, given by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t)\\\\), on the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))(\\\\xi)\\\\) is computed at t = 0, and then the system is left to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) was evolved to t = T under the heat equation and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution of the heat equation at any time \\\\(t\\\\) can be directly obtained from the Fourier transform of the initial condition due to the linearity and time invariance of the system. Therefore, transforming first and then evolving gives the same result as evolving first and then transforming.",
