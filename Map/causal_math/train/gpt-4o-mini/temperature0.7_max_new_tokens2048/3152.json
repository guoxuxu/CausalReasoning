  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The function is analyzed in terms of its effects on integration along a contour in the complex plane. The path of integration, \\\\( C \\\\), is defined from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing only the final value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) G(z) dz \\\\) after the intervention, can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( Z \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\), or both) were used throughout \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end value of an integral involving complex exponential functions, like \\\\( Z \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\), can result from various combinations and modifications along \\\\( C \\\\). Without additional information about the interventions or the path, determining exactly the transformations used is indeterminate.",
