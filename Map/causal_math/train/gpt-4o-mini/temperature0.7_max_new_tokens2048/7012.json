  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across a capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{C}I\\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and I is current. Evaluate the impact of a sudden change in current input described by a Heaviside step function \\\\( I(t) = I_0u(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside function and \\\\( I_0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the voltage V(T), can we determine precisely the values of R and R' used at different times and the initial condition I_0, just by observing the voltage at one time point?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of R and R' values could theoretically result in the same voltage V(T) due to the complex interplay between charging time, resistance changes, and initial current. Identifying the exact values from a single voltage measurement at one time point is therefore not possible without additional information.",
