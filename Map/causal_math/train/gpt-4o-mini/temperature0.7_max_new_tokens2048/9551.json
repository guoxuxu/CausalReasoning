  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of this transformation is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of different transformations, first \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then \\\\( g(z) \\\\), means that the state at time T > t_1 will depend on both transformations. Each contributes exponentially with a different scaling factor to the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\), thus affecting the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in a compound manner.",
