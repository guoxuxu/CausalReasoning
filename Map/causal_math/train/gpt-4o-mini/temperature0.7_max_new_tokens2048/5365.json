  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator equation \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\). Analyze how utilizing a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) a constant, affects the system over a time-scale \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(T(x)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(x_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\) only applies a phase shift in the complex plane that does not affect the evolution of the eigenfunctions of L. Since they are only scaled by \\\\(e^{i\\theta}\\\\), the evolution under the operator remains unaffected, preserving the trajectory.",
