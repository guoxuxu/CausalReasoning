  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing the amplitude and angular frequency respectively. For analysis, a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) is used, representing a Fourier transform component.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed at t = 0 using \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and then evolves over time T without further intervention, will the transformed function be constant over time?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is effectively an integral transformation capturing the frequency component of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since this transformation extracts a constant coefficient from the periodic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the result does not change over time T, yielding a constant value.",
