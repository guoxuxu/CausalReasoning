  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = i \\\\Delta u + k u \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) if \\\\( k \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "The equation involves the diffusion operator \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\), which can cause multiple initial conditions to evolve into similar states at a later time due to the smoothening effect of diffusion. Therefore, it is impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without additional constraints or information.",
