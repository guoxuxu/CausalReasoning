  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\), governing the temperature distribution u(x,t) in a rod along x axis. We consider the impact of an initial temperature distribution manipulated by the function \\\\(g(u) = Au + h\\\\), where A is a constant and h is a constant function.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both interventions were applied just by knowing the outcome at T?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) can potentially arise from various combinations or sequences of interventions due to overlapping effects of linear transformations and constant adjustments. Thus, it's impossible to uniquely ascertain which transformations were applied to reach a specific final state.",
