  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\). This differential equation describes a rotation in the complex plane. The function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nCan we precisely deduce the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the multiplication by \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) at t = 0 obscures the original magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Without knowing whether this scaling was applied, we can't recover \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
