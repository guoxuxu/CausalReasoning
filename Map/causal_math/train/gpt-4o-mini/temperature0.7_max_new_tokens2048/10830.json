  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the integral equation \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} K(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( K(t) \\) is a time-dependent control function applied to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\( f(y) = Cy + D \\) where \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are constant matrices, at time \\( t_0 \\).\n\nCan we determine the exact original control function \\( K(t) \\) from time \\( 0 \\) to \\( t_0 \\) after observing \\( y(T) \\), without knowing whether \\( f(y) \\) was applied at \\( t_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduced by \\( f(y) \\) at \\( t_0 \\) modifies the state of the system in a way that obscures the direct effects of \\( K(t) \\) on \\( y(t) \\) before \\( t_0 \\). Without knowing whether \\( D \\) and \\( C \\) influenced \\( y(t_0) \\), the original dynamics governed by \\( K(t) \\) from \\( 0 \\) to \\( t_0 \\) cannot be reliably determined, making causal inference about \\( K(t) \\) impossible.",
