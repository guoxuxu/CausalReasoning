  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{i\\omega z}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\) are constants, in the context of complex function analysis. The scenario will analyze the impact when \\( z \\) is transformed by different contour integrations in the complex plane.\n\nIf at some point during the integral calculation, an intervention changes the path of integration to a deformable contour that avoids the poles, will the value of the integral depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on the original path or \\( a \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the path of integration to one that does not enclose any poles renders the integral of \\( f(z) \\) to contribute zero due to Cauchy's integral theorem, independent of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\). Hence, this intervention completely disregards the original path's characteristics and approaches zero.",
