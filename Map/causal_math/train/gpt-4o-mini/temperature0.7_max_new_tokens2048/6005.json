  "Problem": "Study a system governed by \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants, and consider the integration through a transform \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) applied to the variable \\( z = x + iy \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf the transformation \\( T(z) \\) is applied to a point \\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\) fulfilling \\( ax_0^2 + by_0^2 = c \\) and no further changes are made to the variables, will the result \\( T(z_0) \\) also satisfy the equation \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( z^3 \\) typically changes both the real and imaginary components of \\( z \\) in such a way that is not linearly or proportionately related to the initial \\( ax^2 + by^2 \\) unless specific relationships between \\( a, b, x, y \\) hold, making general satisfaction of the equation unlikely without those special conditions.",
