  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real function of time t and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\), with A being a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) such that a new function \\\\( x(t) = x(t) + h(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a real function) is applied, will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by adding \\\\( h(t) \\\\) changes the subsequent trajectory, which, when transformed to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), still retains the dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) dictates that the resultant function \\\\( z(T) \\\\), representing both magnitude and phase, continues to depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in addition to how \\\\( h(t) \\\\) has altered the source trajectory.",
