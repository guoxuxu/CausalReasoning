  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagating in a medium characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the wave function, \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(x\\\\) is spatial coordinate, and \\\\(c\\\\) is wave speed. Let's investigate the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at an initial time, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), it is challenging to reverse-engineer the exact state of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\). The transformation adds spectral components that could lead to multiple potential initial conditions that fit the observed state at T, given the non-uniqueness linked to the periodic and oscillatory nature of the wave equation.",
