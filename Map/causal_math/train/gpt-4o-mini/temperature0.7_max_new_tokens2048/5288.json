  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis context where the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) a complex constant, is analyzed in terms of its effect on the unit circle in the complex plane. We are particularly interested in how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), for a real number \\\\( t \\\\), affects the evolution of points under \\\\( f(z) \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint under \\\\( f^2(z) \\\\) after application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we precisely determine both the initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( t \\\\) used in \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The quadratic nature of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the rotational transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduce ambiguities in determining both the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the specific intervention used. Multiple combinations of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) could lead to the same endpoint.",
