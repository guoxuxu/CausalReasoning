  "Problem": "We examine the impact of a complex transformation given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w(z) = e^{i\\pi z} \\\\) on the real and imaginary components of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\dot{y} = x \\\\).\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( v(z) = z + 2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the original differential equations and not on the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( v(z) = z + 2 \\\\) also affects the trajectory by directly altering the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the initial transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\), the natural evolution through the differential equations, and the intervention applied. This makes the trajectory dependent on all applied transformations.",
