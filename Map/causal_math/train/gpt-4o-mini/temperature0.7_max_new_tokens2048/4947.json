  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the integration transformation applied to this function over a period \\\\(T\\\\), defined by the integral \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iAt} dt \\\\).\n\nIf a continuous transformation \\\\( G(t) = e^{iBt}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied from 0 to \\\\(T\\\\), does the integration of this transformation, \\\\( \\\\int_0^T G(t) dt \\\\), uniquely depend on \\\\(A\\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( G(t) \\\\) incorporates additional dynamics into the original function via matrix \\\\(B\\\\), making the resulting integral dependent on both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). The transformation modifies the aggregate behavior, reflected in the integration result.",
