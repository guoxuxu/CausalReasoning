  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) in one dimension, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant representing the diffusion coefficient. We introduce the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior under various scenarios.\n\nIf the initial condition is given by \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\delta(x) \\\\) (a Dirac delta function centered at zero), and evolves under the heat equation without any intervention, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if the initial condition was a constant function?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\delta(x) \\\\) leads to a specific type of solution characterized by the Fourier Transform reflecting the properties of the Dirac delta function. This results in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) = e^{-k \\\\omega^2 t} \\\\), very different from that of a constant function, which affects the character and the decay pattern of the solution over time.",
