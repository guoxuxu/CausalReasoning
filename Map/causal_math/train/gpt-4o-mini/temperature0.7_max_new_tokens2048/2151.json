  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane and governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{-\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) directly counters the effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), but the history of transformations affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the earlier effect of \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) and the later counter-effect, the trajectory and final state are influenced by both parameters.",
