  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t, z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f \\\\) involves a mixture of linear algebraic operations and integral transformations. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} z dt \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was also applied at any point, based only on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may be reached through multiple potential transformations, including different timings or applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The final state does not uniquely encode information about the specifics of which transformations were applied, due to the non-exclusive influence of the transformations on the system's trajectory.",
