  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( u(x, t) = e^{iwx - iwt} \\\\), a wave equation solution, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effects of applying a differential operator \\\\( L = i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) to test causal relationships in transformations.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we modify the system by applying a different operator \\\\( M = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} - i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\), will the outcome at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the wave equation without considering the effects of \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( M \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the wave form and dynamics established by \\\\( L \\\\), changing the system's evolution thereafter. This modification means the resulting state at time T is influenced by \\\\( M \\\\) as well as the original properties of the wave, and not just by the native wave equation evolution.",
