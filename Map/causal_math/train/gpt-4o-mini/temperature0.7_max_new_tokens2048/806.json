  "Problem": "The system is governed by a complex function where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), with A being a real scalar. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iBs} z(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a real scalar, is analyzed for its effects on the system over time interval [0, T].\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval [0, T], can we infer the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) has been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be affected significantly by the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\). Without knowing if or how \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was utilized, many potential initial conditions could result in the same \\\\( z(t) \\\\), especially due to the convoluted nature of integral transformations involving both A and B.",
