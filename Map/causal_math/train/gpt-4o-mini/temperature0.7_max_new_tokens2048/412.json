  "Problem": "We investigate a signal processing system characterized by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system governed by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = h(t) * x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system’s impulse response and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied to the signal defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine if the changes were due to interventions on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or both?",
  "Explanation": "Analyzing \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone does not allow us to uniquely pinpoint whether changes originated from interventions on \\\\( x(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both, as multiple combinations of changes in these functions can produce similar effects in the transformed output. The indistinguishability arises from the convolution's nature and the properties of the Fourier transform, blending effects seamlessly.",
