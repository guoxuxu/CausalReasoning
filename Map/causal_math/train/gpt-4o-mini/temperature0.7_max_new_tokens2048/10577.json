  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. The impact of the Laplace transform on this function is analyzed over a variable \\\\(s\\\\) in the complex domain.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to \\\\(f(z)\\\\) without any intervention, will the resulting transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\) be solely dependent on the structure of matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) directly results in \\\\(F(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}\\\\), where I is the identity matrix and the result only depends on A. Hence, the output is solely determined by the matrix A without any external interventions.",
