  "Problem": "Consider the impact of varying the counterpart of a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant real number, on the integral transform \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\\\). We investigate how changes in \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) affect the outcome of the Fourier transform of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nIf the parameter \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is increased, without any other intervention to \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) or its environment, will the peak of \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) shift accordingly to higher frequencies?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) directly alters the frequency component in \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) which leads to a corresponding shift in the peak of \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) towards higher frequencies. This is due to the inherent properties of the Fourier transform where the frequency domain representation directly correlates to the frequency components present in the time-domain function.",
