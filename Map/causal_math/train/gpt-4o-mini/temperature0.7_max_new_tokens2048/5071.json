  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the impact of the linear operator \\\\( L \\{z\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform, on this function over time.\n\nIf an additional damping factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant) is introduced at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) as an intervention, will the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{e^{-at}z(t)\\}(s) \\\\) be dependent solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor modifies the original function to \\\\( e^{-at}e^{i\\omega t} = e^{-(a-i\\omega)t} \\\\. The Laplace transform now becomes \\\\( L\\{e^{-at}z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + a - i\\omega} \\\\), clearly showing dependence on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), affecting the transformation's outcome.",
