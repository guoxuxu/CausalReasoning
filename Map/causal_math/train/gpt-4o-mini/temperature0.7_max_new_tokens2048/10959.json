  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a rotational motion in the complex plane. We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) applied at time T affects this motion.\n\nIf we adjust the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the value of the function \\\\( H(z) \\\\) at T only reflect the initial \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not the intervened \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) affects the subsequent motion path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and because \\\\( H(z) \\\\) involves integration up to time T, the part of the path after the intervention will incorporate effects due to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Thus, \\\\( H(z)(T) \\\\) reflects the properties of both the initial and intervened values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
