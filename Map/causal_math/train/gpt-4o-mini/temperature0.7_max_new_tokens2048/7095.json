  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant, under various conditions where the function is transformed by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( w \\\\) and not on previous transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = z + 1 \\\\) alters the trajectory by introducing an additive shift, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the earlier transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) as well. The sequence of transformations affects the path taken by the system, modifying the endpoint output.",
