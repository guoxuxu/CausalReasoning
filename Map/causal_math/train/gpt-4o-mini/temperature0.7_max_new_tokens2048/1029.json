  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) changes the initial condition of the system by adding an exponential term \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), which alters the evolution of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\). This added term evolves and affects the diffusion process distinctively, resulting in a different state at time T.",
