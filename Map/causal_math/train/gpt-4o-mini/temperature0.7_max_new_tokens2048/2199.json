  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response h(t) is being studied. The signal s(t) is processed, and we analyze the influence of convolution with the impulse response and a Fourier transform applied to the signal.\n\nIf a filtering process described by another impulse response g(t) is applied as an intervention after the initial convolution but before the Fourier transform, will the Fourier transform of the final output depend exclusively on the original h(t) or both h(t) and g(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter g(t) leads to an additional convolution process, making the Fourier transform of the eventual outcome dependent on both h(t) and g(t). The final transformation represents the product of the Fourier transforms of s(t), h(t), and g(t), influenced by the sequential convolutions.",
