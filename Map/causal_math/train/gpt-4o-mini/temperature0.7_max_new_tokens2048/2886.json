  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\). We explore the effect of a convolution operation where \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another time-domain function and the corresponding Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf only the function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is known, can it unequivocally determine the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) independently without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) only provides the product of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Without additional constraints or knowledge about one of the functions, there are potentially multiple pairs \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) that could result in the same \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
