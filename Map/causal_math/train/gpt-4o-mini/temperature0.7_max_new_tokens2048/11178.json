  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), for some complex square matrix A. We evaluate the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also complex matrices.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), we cannot accurately backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the potential alteration brought by \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\). Additionally, if C and D do not commute with A, they can significantly alter the transformation path, making reconstruction of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) non-trivial and ambiguous.",
