  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) describes a rotation with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We explore the response of the system when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to a transformation using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and then evolved with \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) for a time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still trace a circular path in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L \\\\) alters the initial condition based on linear transformation, shifting and/or scaling \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The trajectory will then evolve from this new starting point and will not generally trace the original circular path, especially if the translation component \\\\( b \\\\) is non-zero.",
