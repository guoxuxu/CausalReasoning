  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. Consider the Laplace transform definition \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at some \\\\( s = b \\\\), can one uniquely determine the original constant \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), the original constant \\\\( a \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the transform as it is the point where the function has a pole. No additional transformation or information is needed to deduce \\\\( a \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
