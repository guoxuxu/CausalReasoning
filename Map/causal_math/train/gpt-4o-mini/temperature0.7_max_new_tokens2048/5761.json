  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We investigate the effect of the inverse transformation given by multiplying the transform by \\\\( s^2 \\\\) and then applying the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nIf the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is multiplied by \\\\( s^2 \\\\) and then the inverse transform is applied, will the resulting function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) be directly proportional to \\\\( t^2f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( s^2 \\\\) in the s-domain corresponds to differentiating twice in the time domain thanks to the properties of the Laplace transform. The result of applying the inverse Laplace transform will thus correspond to the second derivative of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), which is proportional to \\\\( t^2e^{at} \\\\) in this context.",
