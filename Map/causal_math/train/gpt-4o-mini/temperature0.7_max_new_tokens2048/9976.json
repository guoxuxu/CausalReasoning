  "Problem": "Consider the impact of two different integral transforms on a function h(t), one being the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and the other being the Fourier Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). These transformations are applied to h(t) to evaluate their influences and potentially infer properties of h(t) from their transformations. The function \\( h(t) = e^{-kt} \\) for \\( k > 0 \\).\n\nBy observing the Laplace Transform of h'(t) as \\( \\\\frac{1}{s+k+m} \\), can we determine what specific interventions (values of m) were applied to the original h(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the new pole at \\( s+k+m \\) in the Laplace Transform of h'(t), we can uniquely resolve the intervention by calculating the difference between the new and original poles, pinpointing the exact value of m that was added to k.",
