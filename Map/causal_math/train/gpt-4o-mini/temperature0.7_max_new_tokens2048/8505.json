  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), and A and B are scalar constants. We explore causal relationships under the Fourier transform defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nIf no intervention is applied to the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and it evolves under its natural laws, will the transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\) reflect only the properties of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, because the Fourier transform of the function does not change the underlying dynamics governed by A and B; it only alters the domain from time to frequency. Hence, the characteristics of A and B are preserved in the transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\).",
