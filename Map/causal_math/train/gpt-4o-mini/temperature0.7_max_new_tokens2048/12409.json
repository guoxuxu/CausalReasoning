  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a linear integral transformation defined by \\\\(I[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA} f(s) ds\\\\) where A is a constant matrix and f is a vector-valued function. We assess the effect of a function perturbation on the transformed system where \\\\(f(s)\\\\) is replaced by \\\\(g(s) = e^{Bs} f(s)\\\\), with B being another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the output of the integral transformation at T for \\\\(g(s)\\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\(f(s)\\\\) used at the initial time if \\\\(e^{Bs}\\\\) was applied but not necessarily known?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation \\\\(e^{Bs}\\\\) applied to \\\\(f(s)\\\\), recovering the original form of \\\\(f(s)\\\\) simply from the transformed output is impractical. The alteration by \\\\(e^{Bs}\\\\) adds exponential complexity that modifies s-dependent behavior, making backward deduction challenging.",
