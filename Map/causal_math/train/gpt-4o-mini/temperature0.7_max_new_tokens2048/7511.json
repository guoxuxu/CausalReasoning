  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a function \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\) on a complex variable \\( z \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\), where \\( k \\) is a complex constant, and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), another function \\( j(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\) (where \\( \\theta \\) is another real number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on \\( k \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\theta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( j(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) results in an additional rotational impact, making the final state \\( z(T) \\) dependent on the combined effects of \\( k \\), \\( \\omega \\), and \\( \\theta \\). The exponential components in \\( e^{i\\omega t_1} \\) and \\( e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)} \\) both influence the final state calculations.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(z) influences the variable z, which in turn affects its rate of change dz/dt. The constant k governs the rate of change dz/dt, which also impacts the final value z(T). The function j(z) similarly influences z, affecting the final outcome z(T). The function h(z) is influenced by the angular frequency ω, while the function j(z) is influenced by the angular frequency θ.",
