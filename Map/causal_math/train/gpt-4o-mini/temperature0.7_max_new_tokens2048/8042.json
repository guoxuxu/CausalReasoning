  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The differential equation governing the dynamics is \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to ascertain whether the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) comes from the pathway \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda t}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda t}e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). The potential phase shift introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) obscures the original value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
