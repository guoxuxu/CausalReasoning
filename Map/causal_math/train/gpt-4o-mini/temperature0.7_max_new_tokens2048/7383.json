  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions, expressed as \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a potential function. An external spatial transformation is defined by \\\\(h(x, y) = (e^{ax}, e^{by})\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by modifying the potential function \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) through a linear addition of a constant k (i.e., \\\\(u(x, y) = u(x, y) + k\\\\)) at \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), will the transformed system \\\\(u(h(x, y)) + k\\\\) still satisfy the Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a constant to a harmonic function results in another harmonic function since the Laplace operator \\\\(\\\\nabla^2\\\\) annihilates constants. Therefore, if \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) was originally harmonic, the transformation followed by the addition (or vice versa) will still yield a function satisfying the Laplace equation.",
