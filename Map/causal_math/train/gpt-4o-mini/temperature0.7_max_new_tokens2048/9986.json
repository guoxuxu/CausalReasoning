  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where functions are transformed by Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We explore how integrating these transformations affects the plane's structures, examining the impact of tweaking the function by a constant linear shift \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\) where c is a real number.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) in the form \\\\( G(s) = F(s) + \\\\frac{c}{s} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the constant \\\\( c \\\\) used for the shift without extra information?",
  "Explanation": "While you can infer that a shift occurred and even determine the magnitude of the shift, \\\\( \\\\frac{c}{s} \\\\), the exact values of \\\\( c \\\\) and the uniqueness of the corresponding \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be determined without additional constraints or data.",
