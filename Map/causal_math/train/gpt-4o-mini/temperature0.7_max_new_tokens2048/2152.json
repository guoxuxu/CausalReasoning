  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane and governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), just by the endpoint value?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios could lead to the same endpoint due to the non-commutativity and complex nature of the exponential transformations in the complex plane. The potential for equivalent state trajectories emanating from different sequences and types of transformations precludes a definitive determination of the applied transformations based solely on the endpoint.",
