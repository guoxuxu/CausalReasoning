  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain z as \\\\( f(z) = c^z \\\\) for a constant c. Analyze how the Laplace transform impacts this function when converted using an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can one unambiguously retrieve the constant c used in the original function \\\\( f(z) = c^z \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The complex exponential nature and the constants in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) may yield similar transforms for different values of c due to the properties of exponential growth and decay, meaning the exact value of c cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
