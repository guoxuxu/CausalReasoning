  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(s) ds \\\\), with the kernel transformation \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-st} \\\\). We explore the impact of a modifying function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the system over the variable t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to an initial function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) such that \\\\( z'(0) = 0^2 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the given integral transformation without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) retain the modified initial condition set by \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) modifies the initial condition but does not alter the nature of the integral transformation. Since the initial state is now squared, it influences the entire subsequent trajectory dictated by the kernel, thus maintaining the modified effect throughout the evolution.",
