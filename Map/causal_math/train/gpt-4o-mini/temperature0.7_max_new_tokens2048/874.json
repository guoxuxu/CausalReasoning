  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function describing displacement and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. The Laplace transform is used to study how system characteristics change when subject to different conditions or transformations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we precisely infer the initial displacement \\\\( u(0) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The factor \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influences its Laplace transform, masking the effect of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) alone. Without knowledge of \\\\( \\omega \\\\), multiple initial conditions could correspond to the same transformed outcome due to frequency modulation effects.",
