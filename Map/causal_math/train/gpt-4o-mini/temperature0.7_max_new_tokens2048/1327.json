  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nIf at a specific point z after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), an intervention is applied by then squaring the result (\\\\( g(f(z)) = (e^{iz})^2 \\\\)), will the final outcome depend on the order of these transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f \\\\) followed by \\\\( g \\\\) as an intervention results in \\\\( (e^{iz})^2 \\\\), which is different from \\\\( e^{i(z^2)} \\\\) (outcome of g then f). The exponential function composition with squaring leads to distinctly different results due to non-commutativity of these operations.",
