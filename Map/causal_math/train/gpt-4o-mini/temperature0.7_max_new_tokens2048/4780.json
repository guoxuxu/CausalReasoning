  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\), where the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) governs the dynamics of \\\\(z\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) is a vector of initial conditions. The system undergoes a transformation via another function \\\\(h(z) = Mz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a transformation matrix.\n\nCan one determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied at times \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and \\\\(t_1\\\\) respectively, merely by observing the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact transformations applied just by observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is not feasible due to the mathematical properties of matrix multiplication and exponential, where different combinations of \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(N\\\\), and initial conditions \\\\(C\\\\) can yield the same final state under certain conditions. This ambiguity prevents a unique determination of the applied transformations without further data.",
