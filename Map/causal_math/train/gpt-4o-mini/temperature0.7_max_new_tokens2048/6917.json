  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined in the complex plane, which represents a rotation as a function of time. Analyze how the Laplace Transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\)) of this function, given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}e^{it} \\\\, dt \\), affects the original function's behavior under various conditions.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes the transformation of Laplace Transform without any additional manipulation, will the transformation inherently alter the function's frequency property?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) changes the domain from time to a complex frequency domain, inherently altering its characteristic as a function of frequency, including the interpretation and behavior of the signal.",
