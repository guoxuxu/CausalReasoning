  "Problem": "Consider a physical system under the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 \\\\phi = \\\\rho\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is the potential field and \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the charge density. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform to both sides of the equation in the context of changing system conditions.\n\nIf the charge density \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) changes over time without intervention, affecting the potential field as per the Poisson equation, will the Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) at a later time still reflect this change in \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changes in the charge density \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) directly alter the potential field \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) according to the Poisson equation. Since the Fourier transform is a linear operator, the transform of \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) will correspondingly reflect the changes in \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\), demonstrating the causal relationship from charge density to potential field.",
