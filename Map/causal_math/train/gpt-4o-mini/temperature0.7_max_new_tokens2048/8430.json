  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\), and A is a complex number. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( Tz = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( Tz \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the transformation \\\\( Tz \\\\) significantly influences the initial and evolving states of the system. Without knowing whether this transformation was applied, several different scenarios might lead to the same observed output at t = T, especially because the transformation integrates the evolving function \\\\( z(\\\\tau) \\\\) under an exponential influenced by B.",
