  "Problem": "Consider a physical system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = 0 \\\\) in a region R. An external force is modelled by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) that modifies the boundary conditions of R at time t = 0. We analyze the effect of this initial condition and subsequent interventions on the solution u(x, y, t) across the domain.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the initial boundary condition \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) from the solution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at a later time T, without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace equation is deterministic and the solution in a well-defined domain with known boundary behaviors is uniquely determined by its initial conditions, one can infer \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at any time T with the correct inverse problem approach.",
