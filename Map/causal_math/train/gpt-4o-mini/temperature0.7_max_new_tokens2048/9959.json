  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u(x,t) = -\\\\lambda u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the state of the system at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) which converts the spatial component to the frequency domain.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an additional transformation \\\\( G(u) \\\\) described by a convolution with a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied, does the final Fourier transformed state \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend on the form of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) before the further evolution of the system modifies the state of the system in the spatial domain, which translates to a multiplication in the frequency domain by \\\\( F(h)(k) \\\\). The final state \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) will thus reflect this change and will depend on both the initial conditions and the nature of \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
