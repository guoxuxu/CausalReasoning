  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature (T) at any spatial point (x,y) in a region follows the heat equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We study the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the temperature distribution, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), and analyze its influence over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed temperature distribution \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial temperature distribution at t = 0 without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier Transform was applied, reconstructing the original spatial temperature distribution T from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)(t)\\\\) is uncertain. The transformation might encode the frequencies differently, obscuring the real starting conditions.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution at any time, T(x,y,t), influences the temperature distribution at the next time step, T(x,y,t+Δt). The temperature distribution also affects the Laplacian of the temperature, ∇^2 T(x,y,t), which in turn influences the rate of change of temperature, ∂T/∂t. This rate of change of temperature affects the temperature distribution at the next time step. The initial temperature distribution at time t=0, T(x,y,0), influences the temperature distribution at any later time, T(x,y,t). The temperature distribution at any time also influences its Fourier transformed version, \\mathcal{F}(T)(t), which can be used to calculate the Fourier transformed version at t=0, \\mathcal{F}(T)(0).",
