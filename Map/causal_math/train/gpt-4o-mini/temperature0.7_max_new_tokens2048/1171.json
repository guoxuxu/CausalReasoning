  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions describing a physical system. We investigate a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency, applied to this system over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\) (with \\( \\theta \\) as another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on \\( \\lambda \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\theta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the additional intervention \\( g(z) \\), the final state \\( z(T) \\) at time T will deviate from being solely dependent on \\( \\lambda \\), influenced by both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\). These transformations introduce complex rotations and scaling to the trajectory, impacting the resulting state at \\( z(T) \\).",
