  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyzing the system under the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we confirm that the initial condition was \\\\( z(0) = 0 \\\\) without knowledge of any potential intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) as \\\\( \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\) uniquely results from \\\\( z(0) = 0 \\\\) under the original differential equation in its Laplace-transformed state. Any non-zero initial condition would alter the numerator reflecting initial state contributions.",
