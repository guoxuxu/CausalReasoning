  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), where \\( \\\\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z \\) represents a complex function. Investigating the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\( a \\) is a real constant.\n\nSuppose at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\( b \\) is another constant) is applied, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\( \\\\omega \\) and not on \\( a \\) or \\( b \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces another level of complexity, altering the magnitude of \\( z \\) at that point. The end state \\( z(T) \\) is thus influenced by \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( \\\\omega \\), given how the transformations \\( e^{at} \\) and \\( e^{bt} \\) affect the pathway of the complex function \\( z \\) over time.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The time t influences the state z, while z causes the rate of change dz/dt. The rate of change dz/dt is determined by the constant ω.

The state z(T) at time T is a result of the rate of change dz/dt.",
