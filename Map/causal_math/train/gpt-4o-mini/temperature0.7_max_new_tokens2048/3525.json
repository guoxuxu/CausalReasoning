  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + u_{xx} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) are the time and second space derivatives of \\\\(u\\\\), respectively. To study the problem, we use the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x,t)dx\\\\).\n\nIf we initially apply a Fourier transform to a function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and then allow the system to evolve according to \\\\(u_t + u_{xx} = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be represented accurately by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T) = \\\\hat{u}(k, 0)e^{-k^2T}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution, given the linearity and time-invariance of the partial differential equation, will evolve according to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\hat{u}(k, 0)e^{-k^2t}\\\\). Therefore, the transformed state at time T is correctly described by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)e^{-k^2T}\\\\).",
