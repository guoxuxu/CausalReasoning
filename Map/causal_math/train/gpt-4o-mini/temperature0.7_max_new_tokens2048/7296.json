  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator on function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\). To analyze the system's behavior, we explore the effect of applying Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), particularly focusing on the transformation over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations and their effects in the Fourier and spatial domain can overlap in ways that make it impossible to distinctly identify which interventions were applied just by observing the endpoint in the Fourier domain. Different combinations of operations and interventions could potentially result in the same or indistinguishably similar outcomes.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, t) is influenced by the linear differential operator L, which causes the change in u over time represented by ∂u/∂t.
