  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and its inverse operation.\n\nIf a manipulating function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing the distribution according to \\\\( u'(x, t_1) = u(x, t_1) + h(x) \\\\), and the system continues to evolve by the heat equation, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be unaffected by \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a modification to the temperature profile at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which affects the subsequent distribution due to the heat equation's nature to spread and equalize temperature variations over time. The evolution of \\\\( u'(x, T) \\\\) will depend on both the initial conditions and the modifications introduced by \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
