  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) which represents the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) applicable over the domain of complex numbers for \\\\( z \\\\). The system's behavior is analyzed by varying the complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) and examining the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2u(z) \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to precisely reconstruct the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from knowing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) if we have no information about the initial transformation on \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) requires not only the inversion of the Laplace transform, but also accurate knowledge of how \\\\( z \\\\) was treated. Lack of details on whether or how \\\\( z \\\\) was transformed (e.g., squared) before being applied in \\\\( u(z) \\\\) makes it infeasible to uniquely identify \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alone.",
