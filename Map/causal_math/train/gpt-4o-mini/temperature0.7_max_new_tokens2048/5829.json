  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), and assume a perturbation in the form of multiplication by a complex exponential, \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is an original signal and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency.\n\nIf a signal \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) initially and then its Laplace transform is calculated, will the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) at s = \\\\sigma be the same as the transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at s = \\\\sigma - i\\\\omega without applying \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a function multiplied by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a shift along the imaginary axis by \\\\( -i\\\\omega \\\\). Therefore, the transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at s = \\\\sigma will indeed be the same as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(\\\\sigma - i\\\\omega) \\\\), corresponding to a simple shift in the complex plane.",
