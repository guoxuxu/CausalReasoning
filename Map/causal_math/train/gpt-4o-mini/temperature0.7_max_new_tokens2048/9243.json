  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\alpha s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\beta s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant different from \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T depend only on the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduce modifications that contribute to the final state, affecting both amplitude and phase. Therefore, the final state depends on \\\\( w \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), not solely on the natural frequency \\\\( w \\\\). The interplay between these parameters shapes the outcome at T.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex state z0 causes the state z(t) at time t, and the frequency w influences z(t). The integral transformation g(z) affects z(t) based on the constant α, while the transformation h(z) influences z(T) based on the constant β. Thus, the final state z(T) is influenced by both h(z) and the initial state z0, as well as the frequency w.",
