  "Problem": "Let's examine a complex function scenario given by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces a unit circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We are interested in the effect of a transformation using another function, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied to this time-varying function.\n\nIf at some point before time T, another transformation, \\\\( k(z) = z^3 \\\\), is applied, will the path at time T solely reflect the influence of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( k(z) = z^3 \\\\) introduces an additional change in both magnitude and angular velocity of the complex path, making the resulting path at time T a combination of the effects of the original function and the transformations applied. The trajectory becomes a combination of these influences, reflecting cubic growth in angular displacement.",
