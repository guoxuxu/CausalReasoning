  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant real matrices. An integral transformation is applied, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ct'} z(t') dt' \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under the differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equal to if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) evolved directly to t = T under its respective differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions due to the integration and potential influence of the matrix C, which can alter the behavior of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). This results in a different trajectory and endpoint for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T.",
