  "Problem": "Consider a time-varying complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We look at the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf, during the transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\), an additional convolution with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before the Fourier transform is computed, will the resultant \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) still reflect only the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by convolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) prior to computing the Fourier transform results in the Fourier transform of possibly modified frequencies due to the properties of the convolution. \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) will now reflect the frequency content of both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), not merely the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
