  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\\\). This transformation is applied to a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int h(x) K(x, s) dx \\\\). Investigate the effects of the transformations and their reversibility across different conditions.\n\nIf no modifications are made to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) after applying the kernel transformation, will \\\\( g(s) \\\\) preserve the original features of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) such that \\\\( h(x) \\\\) can be fully reconstructed from \\\\( g(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The kernel smooths the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) due to its Gaussian nature, potentially losing sharp features or high-frequency components in \\\\( h(x) \\\\). Therefore, some original features of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) may not be preserved in \\\\( g(s) \\\\), making exact reconstruction of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) from \\\\( g(s) \\\\) impossible without additional information.",
