  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = a u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = b v \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants. We apply an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{kt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and allow it to evolve under the given differential equations without any further operations, will the integration change the trajectories of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) does not alter the trajectories of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or \\\\( v(t) \\\\) since this transformation is applied after the evolutionary process as an analysis tool. The underlying systems governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = a u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = b v \\\\) evolve independently of the integration.",
