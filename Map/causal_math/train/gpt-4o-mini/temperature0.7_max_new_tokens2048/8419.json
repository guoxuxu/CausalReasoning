  "Problem": "Examine the linear system driven by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. Consider the complex function transformation \\\\(h(x) = S \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)x\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a linear transformation \\\\(k(x) = U\\\\exp(-i\\\\omega t)x\\\\) (with \\\\(U\\\\) being a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the resulting state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be independent of the initial transformation matrix \\\\(S\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state trajectory further, making the resultant state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) also dependent on both the initial transformation by \\\\(S\\\\) and the intervention by \\\\(U\\\\). The matrix exponentials and the respective commutativity or lack thereof between these matrices and \\\\(M\\\\) will affect the state at any future time \\\\(T\\\\), making it reliant on all matrices involved.",
