  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(x) \\) defined in the complex plane and a contour integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is a closed path in the complex domain. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation \\( T(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) to the function before integrating.\n\nIf \\( T(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(x) \\) over the path \\( \\gamma \\), then integrated, will the result of \\( \\int_{\\gamma} T(z(x)) \\, dx \\) be the same as first integrating \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\) and then applying \\( T \\) to the result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T \\) changes the nature of the integrand, potentially altering the singularities and residues inside \\( \\gamma \\). This operation is not commutative with integration, as integration first would sum the properties of \\( z \\) along \\( \\gamma \\), while applying \\( T \\) first changes these properties locally before accumulating them.",
