  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We study the implications of applying a transformation denoted by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on this system dynamics.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\), an intervention applying \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) is introduced, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be independent of the previous transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be significantly affected by the prior transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), as each transformation modifies the system's state in a unique way. The cubic intervention further alters trajectory by tripling the angle and affecting the amplitude, thus making the final outcome dependent not only on the original dynamics but also on all intervening transformations.",
