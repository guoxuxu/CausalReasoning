  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is analyzed under the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being a constant phase shift.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding a phase shift \\\\( \\theta \\\\). The evolution of this new initial condition under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a trajectory that is phase-shifted by \\\\( \\theta \\\\) compared to the unmodified trajectory, leading to \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T + i\\theta} \\\\), not \\\\( e^{i\\omega T} \\\\).",
