  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\). We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform-based controller defined by \\( G(s) = s + k \\) for some constant \\( k \\) on the system's response.\n\nBy observing \\( y(t) \\) at some time T, can we determine the value of \\( k \\) if the system has been operating without the controller \\( G(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the controller \\( G(s) \\) is not in effect, the output \\( y(t) \\) at any time T is purely a function of \\( H(s) \\) and the input \\( u(t) \\). Hence, no information regarding \\( k \\) can be deduced from \\( y(t) \\) under these conditions.",
