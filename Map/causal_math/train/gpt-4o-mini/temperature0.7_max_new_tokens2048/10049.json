  "Problem": "In a study of fluid dynamics, let \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid on a plane, subject to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\). We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial velocity field \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and propagated based on the transformed equation without further intervention, will the transformed field at \\\\( t = T \\\\) represent the Fourier transform of the field evolved by the original equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform linearizes the convection term in the PDE. By solving in the Fourier space and converting back, we ensure that solutions are consistent across both domains under linear transformations. Thus, evolving in Fourier space and in real space should yield equivalent results when transformed appropriately.",
