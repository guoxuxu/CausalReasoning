  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We apply a Laplace transform on \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and explore how the transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), behaves under different initial conditions and interventions with additional transformations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we infer that the original function was \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) without knowing the original form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The functional form of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) is uniquely and directly associated with \\\\( e^{az} \\\\), allowing us to deduce the original function reliably.",
