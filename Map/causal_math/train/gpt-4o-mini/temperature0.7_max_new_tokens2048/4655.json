  "Problem": "Consider a function modeled by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) where z is a complex number. We evaluate the effects of an additional transformation defined as \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the analytic function w.\n\nIf before applying \\\\( w(z) \\\\), another transformation, \\\\( h(z) = z - b \\\\) (where b is another complex constant), is used as an intervention at a specific point, will the outcome solely depend on the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) irrespective of the constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\), along with the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), results in a final input to \\\\( w \\\\) of \\\\( z_0 + a - b \\\\). Thus, the outcome at \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is influenced by both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), affecting the resultant state based on how these complex shifts interact.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The variable z transforms into w(z) through the transformation w, and it also transforms into g(z) through the addition of a. Additionally, z transforms into h(z) through the subtraction of b, and h(z) subsequently transforms into w(z).
