  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\). We explore the effects of a multiplied exponential function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and its corresponding Laplace transformation \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the constant \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the value of \\\\( a \\\\), it's impossible to correctly back-transform to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) because the shift in the s-domain cannot be accurately adjusted without knowledge of the value \\\\( a \\\\).",
