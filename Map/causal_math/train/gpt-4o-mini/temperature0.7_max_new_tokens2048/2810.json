  "Problem": "A function optimization process utilizes a Gaussian integral transformation with \\\\( G(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\). This function is utilized to optimize another function \\\\( H(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 4x^2 \\\\) over its domain.\n\nCan we infer the form of \\\\( H(x) \\\\) by analyzing the output of the transformed function without knowing the applied transformation \\\\( G(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation \\\\( G(x) \\\\) applied, it is not feasible to accurately determine the original form of \\\\( H(x) \\\\) simply from the output. The transformation could significantly modify the appearance and properties of the resulting function, obscuring information about the original function.",
