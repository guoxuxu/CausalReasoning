  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)](s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) + i\\\\mathcal{L}[v(t)](s) \\\\). We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = az + b \\\\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) before taking its Laplace Transform, does the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) change compared to directly computing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t) \\\\)] and then applying the transformation in the s-domain (applying equivalent transformation on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before the Laplace transform changes the function to which we apply the transform, yielding \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[az(t) + b](s) \\\\). This is different from computing \\\\( aZ(s) + b/s \\\\) if directly transforming after. The operations in the time domain and frequency domain do not commute.",
