  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(\\\\alpha + i\\\\beta)u} z(u) du \\\\) with constants \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\).\n\nGiven the result of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to recover the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether an integral transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) introduces an integration with an exponential weighting factor which masks the original amplitude and phase information contained in \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Recalling \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) without knowing the specifics of the transform parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is generally infeasible because the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is entangled with the exponential term in the transform.",
