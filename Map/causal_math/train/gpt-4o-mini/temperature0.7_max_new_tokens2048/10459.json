  "Problem": "In the examination of a physical system governed by the wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\), where c is the wave speed, consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) applied to u(x, t) and its properties across time and space.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a modifying function \\\\( g(u) = e^{ikx}u \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint wave profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the wave speed c and not on the initial condition or the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the modifying function \\\\( g(u) = e^{ikx}u \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a spatially varying phase shift into the wave profile. This alteration affects the subsequent evolution of the wave under the wave equation, making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on the initial condition, the properties of the wave equation, and the specifics of the intervention.",
