  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\), where D is a linear differential operator. Investigate the influence of a transformation characterised by \\\\( h(z) = z^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\) on the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where k is a non-zero scalar and C is a constant.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new function \\\\( j(z) = z^{m}e^{Dt} \\\\) (where m is a scalar and D is a constant) is applied at some point \\\\( x_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(X) \\\\) for X > x_1 be influenced only by the operator D and not C or k?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( j(z) \\\\) as an intervention at \\\\( x_1 \\\\) adds another dimension of transformation, affecting the ultimate state at X. This state depends not only on D but also significantly on the effects of transformations C and k from \\\\( h(z) \\\\) as well as m and D from \\\\( j(z) \\\\).",
