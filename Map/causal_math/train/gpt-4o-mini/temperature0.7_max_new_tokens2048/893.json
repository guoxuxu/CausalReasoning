  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t)\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We also introduce a transformation \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) where S is the matrix that diagonalizes D, and K is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t)\\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T result in the same state as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) were evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t)\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Using the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) changes the initial state via the matrix \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Kt}S \\\\). This transformation introduces dynamics which depends on K. Since K may introduce new eigenvalues, the evolution path alters when compared to directly using D.",
