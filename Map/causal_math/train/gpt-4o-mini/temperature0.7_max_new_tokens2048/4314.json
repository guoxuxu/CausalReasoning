  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and A, B, C, D are constants. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](s) \\\\) and its inverse on the dynamics of this system.\n\nAfter observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can one unambiguously trace back to the original initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The ambiguity in knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied complicates back-calculating to \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Without this knowledge, multiple potential initial conditions, differing by their frequency components due to the Fourier transform, could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
