  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in terms of spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nGiven the observation of the Fourier Transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at t = T, can we deduce \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) the initial state in real space without knowing whether a Fourier Transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier Transform can be applied to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) to successfully deduce \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), and then the inverse of the evolution under \\\\(L\\\\) can be applied, assuming \\\\(L\\\\) is reversible, to find \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\). However, this relies heavily on the properties of \\\\(L\\\\) and assumes no loss of information during transformations.",
