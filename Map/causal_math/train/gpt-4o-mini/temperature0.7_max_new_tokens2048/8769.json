  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the causal effects using the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), which transforms this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by the Laplace Transform without any modifications, will the absence of any poles of \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) in the left half of the complex plane indicate a purely oscillatory behavior in the time-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a function with a pole at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\). The absence of poles in the left half-plane (real part of s < 0) confirms that the signal does not exhibit exponential growth or decay, thus indicating purely oscillatory behavior.",
