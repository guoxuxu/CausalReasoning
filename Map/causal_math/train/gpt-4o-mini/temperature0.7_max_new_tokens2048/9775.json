  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system that filters an input signal x(t) using a transfer function H(s). We examine how impulse response h(t), which is the inverse Laplace Transform of H(s), affects the output y(t) of the system.\n\nIf at some time t_1 a modulation m(t) is applied to the system as an intervention, changing the original impulse response to h'(t), will the output y(T) for T > t_1 still be predictable solely based on the original H(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system's response properties by altering the impulse response from h(t) to h'(t). As such, the output y(T) will depend on the new modified response characteristics and cannot be predicted solely based on the original H(s).",
