  "Problem": "We consider the Fourier transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\. The system analysis involves altering the input signal using a transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) where a is a constant, and observing the impact on the resulting Fourier transform.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) accurately at t = 0 after applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and then obtaining \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing the value of constant a?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the damping factor a, the exponential modification imposed by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) cannot be accurately reversed. This loss of information about the attenuation rate precludes a precise reconstruction of the initial function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\).",
