  "Problem": "Analyze a system given by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\), and consider the effect of applying a boundary condition transformation represented by \\\\( u = h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a harmonic function.\n\nIf a different harmonic function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied as a new boundary condition at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\), will the internal solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely reflect the changes due to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though a new boundary condition \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at any time T > t_1 will depend on both the previous condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and the new condition \\\\( g(x) \\\\), due to the superposition principle in linear systems and the memory of the earlier state's influence.",
