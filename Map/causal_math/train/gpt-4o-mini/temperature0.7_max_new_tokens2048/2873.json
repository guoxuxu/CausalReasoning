  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) which describes the heat distribution in a rod over time. We also examine a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) which transforms the heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is transformed using an initial Fourier transform and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation, will the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T be the same as solving the heat equation in the spatial domain without the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator that can be applied initially without affecting the dynamics governed by the heat equation. The solution in the frequency domain will correspond to the solution in the spatial domain when transformed back, hence the end solution remains unchanged.",
