  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iωt}\\\\) where \\\\(ω\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a transformation by applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). Further, at a later time, an external operator applies \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z_0 = e^{iω0} \\\\), resulting in \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), and then the system is let to evolve without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Initial square mapping transforms \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), effectively changing the frequency of oscillation from \\\\( ω \\\\) to \\\\( 2ω \\\\). This results in a different trajectory with elevated frequency, leading to a different state at time T.",
