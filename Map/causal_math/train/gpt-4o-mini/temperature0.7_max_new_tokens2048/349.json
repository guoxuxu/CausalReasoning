  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\) on the real function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) when transformed using the Laplace Transform. Let the original system be governed by \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\).\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\) is applied to the Laplace Transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at s = 0, and the system is then evolved without further intervention, will the inverse Laplace Transform at time T yield the same result as the direct evolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the complex function modifies the transform domain representation of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), hence the resultant time-domain function upon inverse transformation will reflect the effects of this function and will not be identical to the unmodified \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\).",
