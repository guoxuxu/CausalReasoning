  "Problem": "Consider a functional relationship expressed as a complex integral transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} h(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a known time domain signal and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the impact of a Laplace transform on the signal's properties.\n\nAfter observing the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine that an additional term was added to \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While modifications in \\\\( H(s) \\\\) indicate changes in \\\\( h(t) \\\\), pinpointing exactly what the added term was (like \\\\( ke^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\)) from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone is not feasible without specific information about the original \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or additional constraints.",
