  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant scalar and \\\\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. We study the effect of the Laplace transform on this function over time interval \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function, can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) only determines the pole at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\), but without additional information about the imaginary part of \\\\( s \\), \\\\( \\omega \\\\) cannot be uniquely resolved due to ambiguities in possible frequencies reflecting the same transform behavior.",
