  "Problem": "Consider a linear function \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, used to transform complex vector input \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is determined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can one determine exactly which transformations were applied at different points (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), knowing just \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformation sequences could yield the same final state due to the complexity of matrix exponential interactions. The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from varying paths depending on when and which transformations were applied, rendering the precise historical inference of transformations infeasible without additional data.",
