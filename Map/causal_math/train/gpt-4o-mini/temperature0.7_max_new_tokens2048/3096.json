  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the impact of the Laplace Transform and its inverse on this function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed result \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) at a later time, can we determine if the original function was scaled by 2 or if some other transformation occurred, solely by examining the value of \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transform \\\\( \\\\frac{2}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) suggests a scaling, it is not definitive evidence for the type of intervention alone. Other potential transformations could yield similar modifications in the Laplace domain (e.g., different types of multiplicative factors or additional shifts). Distinguishing between these requires more context or constraints about the nature of interventions.",
