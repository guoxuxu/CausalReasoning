  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent real parts dependent on a parameter \\\\( t \\\\). The function is subjected to transformation through the Laplace Transform \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), with \\\\( s \\\\) being a complex number.\n\nKnowing the Laplace Transform \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) at some complex s, can one uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its transform without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Provided that the Laplace Transform covers all necessary conditions for invertibility, the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from its Laplace Transform. This is due to the one-to-one nature of the Laplace Transform under appropriate conditions on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
