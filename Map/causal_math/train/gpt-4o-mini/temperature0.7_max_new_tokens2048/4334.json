  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this function.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) without any prior knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the signal \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) is a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), allowing us to precisely determine the frequency of the original signal from its transform, as it explicitly marks the presence of frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and no other.",
