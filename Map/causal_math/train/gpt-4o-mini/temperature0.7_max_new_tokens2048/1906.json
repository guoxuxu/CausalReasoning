  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) that maps complex numbers to other complex numbers defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We analyze the behavior of this function under different transformations and the inversion through the integral transformation \\\\( W(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-uz} w(z) \\\\, dz \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( W(u) \\\\) from the transformed complex function, can we uniquely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without intervention, considering the transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( W(u) \\\\) loses certain information about the specific \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the integral's averaging effect and the exponential nature of \\\\( w(z) \\\\). Multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) may result in the same transformed output, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
