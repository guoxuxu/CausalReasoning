  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is a nonlinear function, representing a closed system. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t{e^{At}F(z) dt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( G(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\), which integrates the effect of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) modified by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) remains indeterminate. The presence of the matrix exponential and the integral transformation obscures the initial conditions in the absence of further information.",
