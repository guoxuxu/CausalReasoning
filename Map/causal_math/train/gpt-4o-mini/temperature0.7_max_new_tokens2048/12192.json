  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) is the temperature distribution over a domain. We investigate the effect of introducing a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) applied from time t = 0, described mathematically as \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\).\n\nIf the source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution at time T, \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\), be different from the scenario where no source term was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) adds energy to the system and alters its initial and boundary conditions. The additional term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) in the heat equation introduces a new component to the temperature distribution throughout the evolution, making \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) fundamentally different from the case without \\\\( S(x) \\\\).",
