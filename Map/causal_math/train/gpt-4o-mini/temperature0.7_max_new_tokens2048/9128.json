  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a linear operator in a complex function space. We investigate how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely whether interventions (either the Fourier transform or its inverse) were employed, by observing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The indistinguishable effects that different transformations can have on the function's state by T (due both to their nature and the linear operator M) introduce uncertainties that prevent a clear determination of which transformations were applied just by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The spectral components could be similarly affected by diverse transformation paths.",
