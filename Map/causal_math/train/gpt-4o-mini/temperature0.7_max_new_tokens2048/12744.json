  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, defined by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is computed at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) for the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), and then \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is evolved according to the heat equation, will the result \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) match the integral transformation of the evolved state without \\\\( T \\\\) being directly reapplied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the heat equation is linear and homogeneous, the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) commutes with the time evolution, meaning \\\\( T \\\\) of the evolved state at time \\\\( T \\\\) matches the evolution under \\\\( T \\\\) applied initially due to the properties of the heat equation and its Fourier transform solution.",
