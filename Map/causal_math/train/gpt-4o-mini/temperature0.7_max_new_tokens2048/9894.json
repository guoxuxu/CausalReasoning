  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) is determined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\), where S is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\) where K is another constant complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\), we lack crucial information about the transformation \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\). This uncertainty makes it impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(z_0\\\\) as multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depending on the action of K.",
