  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let's explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by knowing only the transformed output \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) without any modification?",
  "Explanation": "While the integral transformation provides some hints about the form of the function (e.g., particular terms in the integrand), it does not uniquely specify the function due to potential constants of integration and because the derivative of multiple functions can have the same integral form over an interval.",
