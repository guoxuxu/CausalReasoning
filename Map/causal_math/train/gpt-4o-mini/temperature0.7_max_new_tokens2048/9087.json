  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) representing a heat distribution over a rod along the spatial variable x and time t, governed by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effects of applying a source term \\( S(x,t) \\), which varies along x and t.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), heat insulation (an intervention halting any heat exchange) is applied at a specific location \\( x_1 \\) on the rod, will the resulting distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) at \\( t = T > t_1 \\) only depend on the thermal diffusivity \\( k \\) without being affected by the source \\( S(x,t) \\) or the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of heat insulation modifies the boundary conditions and hence the distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) post \\( t_1 \\). Although it relies heavily on the diffusivity \\( k \\), the final temperature distribution at \\( t = T \\) still reflects the cumulative effects of initial conditions, the source term \\( S(x,t) \\), and the localized insulation.",
