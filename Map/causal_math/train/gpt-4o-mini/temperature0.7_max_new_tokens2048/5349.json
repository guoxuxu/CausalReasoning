  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod along the x-axis is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t}h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a spatial function and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) a decay constant, is applied.\n\nDoes applying \\\\( f(u) \\\\) at an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and allowing the system to evolve change the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T compared to the unmodified initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t}h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial temperature profile. Since the heat equation inherently depends on the initial conditions, this direct modification alters the distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) as the additional term \\\\( e^{-\\\\lambda t}h(x) \\\\) decays over time, influencing the evolution and final state.",
