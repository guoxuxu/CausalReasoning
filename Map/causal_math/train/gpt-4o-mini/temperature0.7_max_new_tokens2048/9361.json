  "Problem": "The behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. The impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\), where c is a real constant, is examined over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the coupled equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the given coupled equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition of the system by scaling \\\\( z_0 \\\\), effectively changing the magnitude and potentially phasing of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The evolution according to the differential equations from this new initial condition results in a trajectory different from that of the untransformed \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
