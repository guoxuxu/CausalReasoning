  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit consisting of resistors and capacitors, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC + \\\\frac{1}{R}}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is the capacitance, \\\\(R\\\\) is the resistance, and \\\\(s\\\\) is the complex frequency. We investigate the response of the circuit to transformations defined by the Laplace transform of the input voltage signal \\\\(V(s) = L[v(t)]\\\\) where \\\\(v(t) = e^{At}v_0\\\\) being an exponential input signal.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an new resistor \\\\(R_2\\\\) is added in parallel to the circuit as an intervention, will the endpoint output voltage \\\\(v_{out}(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the original \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) and not on \\\\(R_2\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\(R_2\\\\) alters the total impedance of the circuit, hence affecting the output signal. The new resistor contributes by changing the resistance path, thereby influencing the circuit’s behavior and the resultant voltage response.",
