  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a series of transforms: firstly by Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), followed by a scaling function in the frequency domain \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then by inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\). Analyze the impact of this transformation chain and its effect on the time-domain behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an initial signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes the described transformations without any other intervention, will the resultant signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) necessarily be a scaled version of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations perform as a linear scaling and frequency adjustment while preserving the signal structure in the time domain, followed by reconstruction into the time domain. This process will scale the signal as per the characteristics defined by \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), but overall, it remains structurally related to \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
