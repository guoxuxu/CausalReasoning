  "Problem": "Investigate a linear system governed by \\\\( dX = NX dt + M dW_t \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Wiener process (Brownian motion). We hypothesize a transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Kt} X \\\\) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) being another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(X) \\\\), the original vector \\\\( X_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced because the transformation \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\) can significantly alter the initial state, interacting uniquely with the system's dynamics and the stochastic noise.",
