  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) driven by a pair of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant scalar.\n\nBased on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), neither, or both) were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the interplay between different exponential scaling factors and both underlying dynamics \\\\( Ax \\\\) and \\\\( By \\\\), multiple trajectory scenarios might yield the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This multiplicity makes it challenging to decipher exactly which transformations, amongst \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both, had been applied solely based on the final observed state.",
