  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are square matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors. The function describes the evolution of two components combined linearly over time and affected by different transformation matrices.\n\nCan we precisely deduce both initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) at t = 0 when given the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, knowing that matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) might not commute?",
  "Explanation": "Since matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) can have differing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and may not commute, their exponential impacts on the vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) might not be straightforwardly reversible. Unless additional conditions or constraints are known about \\\\( A, B \\\\), \\\\( x \\\\), or \\\\( y \\\\), deducing exact initial states just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is generally infeasible.",
