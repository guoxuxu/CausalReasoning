  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is another real constant, applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another scaling factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on the oscillatory behavior dictated by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but also significantly on both exponential scalings from \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). These transformations affect the magnitude which in turn influences the final state at time T.",
