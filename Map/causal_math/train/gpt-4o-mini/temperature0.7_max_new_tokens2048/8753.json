  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We analyze how this function transforms the input \\\\( z \\\\) over iterative applications, particularly under the Mandelbrot set conditions.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is iteratively applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), will the series diverge without any additional intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Depending on the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the parameter c, the iterated function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) can lead to a series that diverges, known behavior in the study of the Mandelbrot set. For certain values, particularly outside the Mandelbrot set boundary, the magnitude of successive iterations grows without bound.",
