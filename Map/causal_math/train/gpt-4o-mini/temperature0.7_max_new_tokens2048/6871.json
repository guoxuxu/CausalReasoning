  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Investigate how the Fourier transform affects this system, particularly through a transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i \\omega' t} dt \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is the variable of transformation.\n\nIf an intervention applies another Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\omega'' \\\\) during the transformation process, will the resulting double transform depend only on the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega'' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a second Fourier transform at a different frequency introduces additional complexity into the system. The final transform result, being a combination of the effects from \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega'' \\\\), will depend on both these frequencies as well as the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The overlapping spectral contributions modify the final output significantly.",
