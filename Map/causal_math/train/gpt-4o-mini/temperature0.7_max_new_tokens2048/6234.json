  "Problem": "Consider a control system in which an input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\) influences the output \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate the change induced by a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) where C and D are also constant matrices.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T without information on whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), the transformation introduced by \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\) can mask the original state, making it impossible to reconstruct \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely due to modifications that cannot be reversed simply based on observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
