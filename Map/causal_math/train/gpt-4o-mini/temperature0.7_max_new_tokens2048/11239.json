  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where C is a real constant representing frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) is studied over the interval \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{2iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) during the evolution, could the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the original differential equation's constant C, without any influence from the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent interventions with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and prior application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduce additional dynamics into the evolving state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through composite effects of their respective integral transformations, influencing the final state observed at time T beyond just the impacts of C.",
