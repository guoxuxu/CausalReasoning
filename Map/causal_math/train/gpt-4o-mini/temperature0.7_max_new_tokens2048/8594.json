  "Problem": "Consider the impact of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) and how it behaves when inverse transformed under different modifications.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine that the original time-domain function was \\\\( te^{2t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming standard conditions (e.g., no non-standard modifications in transform rules), the specific transform result \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-2)^2} \\\\) uniquely corresponds to \\\\( te^{2t} \\\\), allowing us to infer the original function correctly.",
