  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time t according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We analyze the effect of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the observed transformed state at t = T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\( H(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application time of \\\\( H(z) \\\\), the resulting function at t = T after integrating can differ significantly due to varying contributions from S over different durations. This makes it impossible to trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) uniquely.",
