  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} h(x) dx \\\\), known as the Laplace transform. We analyze the behavior of the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{rx} \\\\) under this transformation, where r is a constant, and how modifications to the function and parameters affect inferences regarding cause and effect.\n\nIf a new scaling factor \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is applied to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) at a time \\\\( x = x_1 \\\\), changing \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\beta e^{5x} \\\\) and then undergoing a Laplace transform, will the result \\\\( H(s) \\\\) depend only on the new \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( r \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the nature of the function from \\\\( e^{rx} \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\beta e^{5x} \\\\). The resultant Laplace transformed function depends on both the new parameter and the scaling factor \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), reflecting the historical influence of the original function's parameter \\\\( r \\\\) until the intervention point.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(x) affects the Laplace transform H(s). The constant r influences the form of h(x). The scaling factor beta modifies h(x), which in turn affects H(s). Thus, changes to h(x) through beta will impact H(s), but original r does not directly influence the result after scaling.",
