  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the current state is modified by a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear function. The linear transformation is represented by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the nonlinear function is \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the state vector in a complex function space.\n\nGiven a final state observed at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) solely from observing the outcome and knowing \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nonlinear transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the system's evolution is not easily reversible. The squaring part particularly makes it difficult to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or whether \\\\( h \\\\) was applied because both the original and its negative root could yield the same result post-transformation.",
