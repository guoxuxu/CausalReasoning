  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response h(t) is being studied. The signal s(t) is processed, and we analyze the influence of convolution with the impulse response and a Fourier transform applied to the signal.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the output \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the signal s(t) without knowing h(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing h(t), it is impossible to uniquely recover s(t) from \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\) due to the lack of information about how the input was altered by the system, embodying the convolution with h(t). Various combinations of s(t) and h(t) could yield the same y(t).",
