  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial conditions and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces an additional rotational factor, affecting the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Both the initial transformation with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) contribute to the final state through their respective impacts on the phase of the complex number, resulting in a dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), and the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time variable t influences the complex function z(t), which in turn affects the real components x(t) and y(t). The function h(z) transforms z(t) and this transformation impacts the endpoint z(T). The intervention k(z) also affects the endpoint z(T). The constants \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) influence their respective transformations h(z) and k(z), which suggests that z(T) is dependent on the transformations applied, not solely on the initial conditions.",
