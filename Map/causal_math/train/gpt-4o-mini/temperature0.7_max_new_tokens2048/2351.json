  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nIf during the transformation process an additional filter \\( G(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\) after \\( H(f) \\) and before inverse transformation, will \\( y(t) \\) at the conclusion of this augmented process solely reflect the initial effect of \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\( G(f) \\) as an intervention fundamentally alters \\( Y(f) \\) (the product of \\( X(f) \\) with \\( H(f) \\) and \\( G(f) \\)), complicating the resulting \\( y(t) \\). The final output is influenced by both \\( H(f) \\) and \\( G(f) \\), not just \\( H(f) \\).",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) is transformed into X(f) through a Fourier transform, which is then modified by the transfer function H(f) to produce Y(f). Additionally, X(f) is filtered by G(f) before it also contributes to Y(f), which is then inverse transformed to yield y(t). Therefore, y(t) reflects the combined effects of both H(f) and G(f), rather than solely the effect of H(f).",
