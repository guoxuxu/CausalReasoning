  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex domain. We assess the effect of applying a Laplace Transform, indicated by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to a transformed function \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and validate that \\\\( f(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without prior knowledge of whether a transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the properties of the Laplace Transform output match those expected from \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) (i.e., having poles at specific locations in the s-plane), it indicates the original function. The uniqueness properties of the Laplace Transform in terms of convergence ensure this inference.",
