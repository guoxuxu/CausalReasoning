  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a modulation to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i (\\\\omega + \\\\mu) t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is an additional frequency introduced as an intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) still exhibit a delta function at the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) shifts the frequency of the exponential function. The Fourier transform will therefore result in a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\mu \\\\) instead of the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The intervention modifies the frequency component observable in the transform.",
