  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Suppose the transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at some later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\frac{1}{s-b}Z(s) \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the eventual signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not on parameters \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces yet another layer of modification, making the final signal depend on both parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), as well as the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Each transformation alters the spectrum in a way that affects the resultant time-domain signal.",
