  "Problem": "Let's examine a continuity equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (vu) = 0\\\\), where v is a fixed velocity field. Consider the Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)(k)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx}u(x) dx\\\\) applied to the function u. We explore how this transformation affects the evolution of u over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function u(t) at t = T, is it possible to perfectly deduce the initial function u at t = 0 without knowing the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is an invertible transformation; hence, its application and its inverse can regain the original function from its transformed state at any point in time, provided that u evolves according to the given continuity equation.",
