  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the elliptic partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = -\\\\lambda u(x, y)\\\\) in a region \\\\(D\\\\). We explore how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which converts functions into their frequency components, influences our understanding of the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) of the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is calculated, then is the resulting function in the frequency domain affected by the presence of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) in the original PDE without further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\), which is affected by the parameter \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), reveals how the solution's frequency components are scaled. Each frequency component is scaled inversely proportional to \\\\(\\\\lambda + |\\\\xi|^2\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\xi\\\\) represents the dual frequency variables. Thus, \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) significantly influences the transformed result.",
