  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), utilized in the context of a linear transformation in the complex plane over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The evolution of a complex function \\( g(z) = az + b \\) follows, where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then \\( g(z) \\) is applied without further modification at \\( t = T \\), is the result the same as directly applying \\( g(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\) to \\( z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\( f(z) \\) modifies \\( z_0 \\) through a rotation by \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\), which fundamentally changes the input for \\( g(z) \\). The latter transformation is then applied to a different starting value, producing a distinct result due to the sequence of transformations.",
