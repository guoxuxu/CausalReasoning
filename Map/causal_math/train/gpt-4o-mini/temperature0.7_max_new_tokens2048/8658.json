  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving via the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. The whole system undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to a transformed space where \\\\( sX(s) = AX(s) \\\\) and \\\\( sY(s) = BY(s) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) = x(T) + iy(T) \\\\) at time T, can we certainly backtrack and identify \\\\( z(0) \\\\) if the transformations via A and B are known?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and autonomous nature of the differential equations and knowing the matrices A and B, the Laplace transform properties allow us to uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\( z(0) = x(0) + iy(0) \\\\) by inversely applying the exponential transformations.",
