  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\( \\Delta u = 0 \\) in a region \\( \\Omega \\). An external boundary condition is applied as \\( u = 0 \\) on \\( \\partial \\Omega \\). We investigate the response of the system when subjected to an internal potential \\( f(z) = \\sin(kz) \\), where \\( z \\) and \\( k \\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is introduced at \\( z_0 \\) in \\( \\Omega \\) at the beginning, and the system evolves according to \\( \\Delta u = 0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( u(z) \\) at any other point \\( z \\) in \\( \\Omega \\) remain unaffected by \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( f(z) \\) as an internal potential modifies the harmonic function \\( u(z) \\) throughout the domain \\( \\Omega \\). Even though \\( \\Delta u = 0 \\) guarantees \\( u \\) as a harmonic function, the specific modification at \\( z_0 \\) influences the distribution of \\( u \\) due to the properties of harmonic functions to adjust over the entire domain.",
