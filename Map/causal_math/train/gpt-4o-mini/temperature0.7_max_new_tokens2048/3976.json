  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(t\\\\) is real time variable. We study the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{is}ds * z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions or transformations were enacted (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\) or both), solely from knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in how different transformations and integrations with \\\\(z\\\\) can affect the final state, compounded by the complexity added by each modification, make it indeterminate to uniquely identify the specific transformations or interventions from just \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
