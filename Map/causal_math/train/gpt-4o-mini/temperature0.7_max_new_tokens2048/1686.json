  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagation described by the second order partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial t^2 = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) with a perturbation function \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the profile \\\\(u(T)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce the exact initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) without knowing whether or not the function \\\\(f(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\(f(u)\\\\) was initially applied, the existence of the exponential term \\\\(e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) cannot be confirmed from the final state alone, especially since the transformations influencing equation dynamics are unknown. This uncertainty prevents a deterministic back-calculation of \\\\(u_0\\\\).",
