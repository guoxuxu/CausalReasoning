  "Problem": "Consider a complex mapping scenario given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, over the complex plane.\n\nBy observing the outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at some point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) knowing that \\\\( g \\\\) was applied initially without knowing a?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\) modifies the input by an unknown complex shift, multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could lead to the same \\\\( z_1 \\\\) under different values of \\\\( a \\\\), specifically any \\\\( z_0 \\\\) such that \\\\( z_1 = z_0 + na \\\\) for integers n, creating an ambiguity in determining the unique cause without additional information about \\\\( a \\\\).",
