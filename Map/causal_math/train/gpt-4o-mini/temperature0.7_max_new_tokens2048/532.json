  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = h(t) + g(t)i \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are real functions representing harmonic oscillations. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this complex function over time t.\n\nCan we uniquely determine whether the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) was applied at any time t_1 just by examining the Fourier transform at time T?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in the Fourier transform can indicate alterations in the system, they do not uniquely identify the specific intervention applied. Various types of interventions could produce similar effects in the Fourier spectrum, and additional information would be needed to pinpoint the use of \\\\( D \\\\).",
