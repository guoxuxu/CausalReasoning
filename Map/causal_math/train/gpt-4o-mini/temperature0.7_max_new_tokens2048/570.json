  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow through a variable area duct governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} = -a(x)Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) represents the flow rate and \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a variable coefficient dependent on the position \\\\( x \\\\). We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(Q) = e^{Bx}Q \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the flow rate \\\\( Q(x) \\\\) at x = X, can we deduce the original flow rate \\\\( Q_0 \\\\) at x = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(Q) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(Q) \\\\) was applied, it's unclear if the viewed \\\\( Q(x) \\\\) resulted from a modified or unmodified initial condition. This uncertainty is due to the potential alteration by \\\\( e^{Bx} \\\\), which cannot be unraveled from the final observation alone.",
