  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function describes an oscillatory system in the complex plane. We examine the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system and its implications on the causal inference.\n\nIf the system is initially described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), and it evolves according to this form without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T (computed as \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} (s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\)) remain the same irrespective of any changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} (s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), which clearly depends on the value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Therefore, any change in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) alters the Laplace transform, indicating different system characteristics in the frequency domain.",
