  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation where a signal x(t) is first converted to X(s) using the Laplace transformation. The transformed signal X(s) is then modified by a multiplicative function H(s), which acts as a system's transfer function. Finally, the modified signal Y(s) = H(s)X(s) is converted back to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transformation to yield y(t).\n\nIf an additional filtering operation represented by a function G(s) is applied to Y(s) before inverse transformation, resulting in Z(s) = G(s)Y(s), will the final z(t) still depend strictly on x(t)?",
  "Explanation": "While G(s) modifies Y(s) to produce Z(s), the final output z(t) still causally depends on the original x(t) because every transformation step linearly depends on the preceding step. The path of dependency on x(t) persists, albeit modified by the effects of G(s).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) is transformed into X(s) using the Laplace transformation, which then influences Y(s) through the transfer function H(s). The modified signal Y(s) is further processed by the filtering function G(s) to produce Z(s), which is subsequently converted back to the time domain to yield z(t).
