  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega' s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the resulting function only depend on the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( U \\\\) modifies this trajectory by integrating with a different exponential kernel, so the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) will depend on both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) and their relative kernels. This compounded effect makes the endpoint reliant on the history and nature of each transformation.",
