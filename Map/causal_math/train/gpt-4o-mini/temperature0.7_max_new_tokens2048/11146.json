  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations expressed as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a linear transformation in a vector space. A specific operator \\\\(T(x) = e^{Mt}x\\\\) is applied, with M being another linear matrix, affecting x through an exponential transformation.\n\nAfter observing the system's state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) if we don't know whether \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), the transformation by \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) obscures the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\). The resulting vector at T could originate from variably different initial vectors affected by different matrices M, making precise inference of \\\\(x_0\\\\) impossible.",
