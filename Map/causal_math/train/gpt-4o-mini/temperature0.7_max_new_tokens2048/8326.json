  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\. The function undergoes a Fourier transform, yielding the function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) as a result of the Fourier transform of some function, can we determine if the original function was precisely \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function at a specific frequency in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) indicates a sinusoidal component at that frequency, but it does not exclude the presence of additional phases or amplitudes modified in the original time domain function. More information is needed to exactly confirm the form of the original function.",
