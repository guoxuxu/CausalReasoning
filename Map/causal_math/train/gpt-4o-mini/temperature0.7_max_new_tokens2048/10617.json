  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where z is a complex-valued function of a real variable t, and A is a constant complex square matrix. We evaluate causal relationships and transformations involving the perturbation function \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nWill the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be notably changed at T if initially, at t = 0, we apply the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to z_0 compared to the case where the initial condition is just z_0 without any transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) to the initial condition alters z_0 to \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\). The resulting trajectory will be \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}(Cz_0) \\\\) which in general differs from \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\) because of the matrix multiplication with C, ultimately influencing the system's evolution.",
