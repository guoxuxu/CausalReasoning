  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Mx \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the final solution vector \\\\( x(T) = Mx' \\\\) where \\\\( x' \\\\) is a solution to \\\\( A'x' = b \\\\), can we accurately determine if the matrix A was modified during the process or if only the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Both the original matrix A altered to A' and the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) would affect the final state. Determining the specific contributions of A's modification or M alone to the final solution \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not possible without additional information beyond the final state, as multiple configurations could yield the same result.",
