  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) in the complex plane where \\( A \\) is a non-scalar constant matrix. Examine the evolution of the function under different mappings and their compositional effects.\n\nGiven the output \\( w \\) from \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), can we uniquely deduce \\( z \\) knowing that a linear transformation \\( T \\) might have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\( w = e^{Az} \\) or \\( w = e^{ABz} \\) (where \\( B \\) is unknown), the lack of information about \\( B \\) and the non-invertible nature of exponential functions in complex matrices hinder establishing a unique \\( z \\). The ambiguity due to matrix commutativity also adds complexity.",
