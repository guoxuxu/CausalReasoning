  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) on this function.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) of the function, can we recover the exact original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a spike at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), this exact original function can be uniquely determined by its Fourier transform, indicating a one-to-one mapping in this case.",
