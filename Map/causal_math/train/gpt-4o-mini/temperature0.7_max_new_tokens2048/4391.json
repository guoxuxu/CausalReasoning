  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. The function acts on an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\)\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where the function changes to \\\\( g(t) = e^{iCt}z(t_1) \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, will the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the transformation governed by A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the transformational dynamics of the system to \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will now depend on both the effects of A up until \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the effects of C from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. The system’s path is altered, and its endpoint is dependent on both matrices, not just A.",
