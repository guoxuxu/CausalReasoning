  "Problem": "Assume we have a function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\). Also, suppose an integral transformation of this function using a contour in the complex plane specified as \\\\(T[f(z)] = \\\\int_C f(z) dz\\\\) where C is a semicircular contour from -R to R in the upper half-plane.\n\nCan we accurately determine whether the function was originally \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\) or changed to \\\\(e^{-z^2}\\\\) based on the integral transformation results \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although changing the function alters the integral's value, the results from \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\) when integrated over complex contours are generally highly sensitive and can lead to diverse outcomes due to differences in contour, integration limits, and function properties. These complex interactions render it impossible to uniquely reverse-engineer the original or modified function's form or detect specific changes merely based on the transformation output alone.",
