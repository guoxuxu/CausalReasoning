  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) under an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nFrom observing the output of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] \\\\), can we uniquely identify the original function parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation variable \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\) used in the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) because different combinations of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) might yield similar outputs in certain conditions.",
