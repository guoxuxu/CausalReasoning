  "Problem": "Consider the control system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), where K is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents the control input. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( y \\mapsto H(t) y \\\\), where \\\\(H(t) = e^{Mt}\\\\) and M is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\(y_0\\\\) from the observed state \\\\(y(T)\\\\) after it has been evolved according to \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\) without knowing whether a transformation by \\\\(H(t)\\\\) was applied initially? ",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if a transformation \\\\(H(t)\\\\) was applied initially, it's challenging to revert \\\\(y(T)\\\\) to \\\\(y_0\\\\). Especially if \\\\(H(t)\\\\) significantly alters the initial state at some t, or if M and K do not commute, making it hard to isolate the effects of the initial controls and system dynamics from the transformation.",
