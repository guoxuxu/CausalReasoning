  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. The transformation function considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and the system evolves under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had directly evolved to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), having no effect initially, but the complex multiplication factor changes the trajectory through exponential rotation which interacts differently with the original system coefficients, resulting in a trajectory that differs from the untransformed path.",
