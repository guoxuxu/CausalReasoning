  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\(\\\\Delta T(t)\\\\) in a material is governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T\\\\), where \\\\(k > 0\\\\) is a constant related to the thermal conductivity of the material. We examine the effect of an external heating function \\\\( h(t) = H e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant heat input.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an additional cooling function \\\\( c(t_1) = -Ce^{-kt} \\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant) is applied to the system, does the final temperature \\\\(\\\\Delta T(T)\\\\) depend solely on the initial thermal parameter \\\\(k\\\\) and not on \\\\(H\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature \\\\(\\\\Delta T(T)\\\\) is affected by both the heating and cooling interventions. The constants \\\\(H\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), representing the intensity of heating and cooling, significantly influence the final state at time T, alongside the decay rate controlled by \\\\(k\\\\).",
