  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. This function is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\). We analyze the impact of altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) through an applied transformation \\\\( g(t, z) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real number.\n\nCan we deduce the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied, we cannot confirm if the observed frequency changes in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) were exclusively due to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or a combination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Therefore, deducing the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) with certainty from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is not possible.",
