  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of the function over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a function, can it be uniquely used to determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming convergence and proper conditions, the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformation encodes all necessary information about the original function within its domain.",
