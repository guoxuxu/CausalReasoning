  "Problem": "Consider an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = -ky(t) + \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\lambda (t-s)} y(s) ds \\\\), where k and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. This models a system where the rate of change of \\\\( y \\\\) depends on both its current state and a weighted integral of its history.\n\nIf \\\\( y(0) \\\\) is given a particular value and evolves according to the integro-differential equation, will the solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time t still satisfy the homogeneous equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = -ky(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the integral term involving the history of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) implies that the response of the system is not merely proportional to its current state but also influenced significantly by its past states. This dependency alters the dynamics defined solely by \\\\( -ky(t) \\\\).",
