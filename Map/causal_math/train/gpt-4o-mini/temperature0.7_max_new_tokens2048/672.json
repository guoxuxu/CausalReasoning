  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. Explore the effects of applying a transformation matrix \\\\(T\\\\) to both sides of the equation, resulting in \\\\(T(Ax) = Tb\\\\).\n\nCan the initial system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) and the transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\) be uniquely identified at some time \\\\(t\\\\) given only the final transformed system \\\\(S(TAx) = S(Tb)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\(S(TAx) = S(Tb)\\\\), it is not possible to uniquely backtrack to determine both the initial conditions (\\\\(Ax = b\\\\)) and the transformations applied (\\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\)). Multiple combinations of initial conditions and transformations can lead to the same final state due to properties like non-invertibility or commutativity issues with matrix operations.",
