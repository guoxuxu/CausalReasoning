  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation applied on this function is given by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a fixed positive integer. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), specifically its magnitude and phase, could result from various combinations of n and m, giving rise to complexities that cannot be disentangled without additional data. Different pairings can yield the same outcome, making it impossible to conclusively identify the interventions.",
