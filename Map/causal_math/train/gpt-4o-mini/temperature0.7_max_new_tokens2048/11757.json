  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the harmonic oscillator equations \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant. We explore how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which transforms a function into its frequency components, affects the inference capabilities within the system dynamics.\n\nGiven \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at a time t = T, can we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 by using the inverse Fourier transform without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) \\\\), knowing \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at any t is essentially knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at that time. Therefore, applying the inverse Fourier transform at any point retrieves the original function exactly as it was at t = 0.",
