  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane and governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be identically equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state, introducing an exponential factor influenced by \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\). This change in the initial condition alters how the system evolves under the differential equation, resulting in a trajectory that differs from that of the unmodified initial state.",
