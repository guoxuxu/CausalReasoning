  "Problem": "Let's consider a continuous system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) specifies the system's response behavior. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform on this system, with the Laplace transform defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) = U(s)\\\\).\n\nKnowing the solution \\\\(U(s, x)\\\\) in the Laplace space, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) of the original differential equation without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform method encodes all initial conditions into the transformed equation, and the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) can be directly inferred from \\\\(U(s, x)\\\\) as \\\\(u(0, x) = \\\\lim_{s \\\\to \\\\infty} sU(s, x)\\\\), leveraging the property of the transform in capturing initial conditions as s approaches infinity.",
