  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow system governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional region. Suppose the velocity field is represented as \\\\( \\\\vec{u} = (u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t)) \\\\) and governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. An external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} = (f_x(x,y,t), f_y(x,y,t)) \\\\) can be controlled as an intervention.\n\nFrom the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x, y, T) \\\\), can the exact initial velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x, y, 0) \\\\) be determined without knowing the system's viscosity \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) depends on the viscosity \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\), and this parameter critically affects how perturbations and flows evolve over time. Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\), one cannot uniquely backtrack to determine the exact initial conditions from the state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
