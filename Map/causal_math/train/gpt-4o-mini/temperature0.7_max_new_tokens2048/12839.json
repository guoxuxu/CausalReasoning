  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled harmonic oscillators whose state is described by the vector function \\\\(\\\\vec{z}(t)\\\\). The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{z}} = M\\\\vec{z}\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\vec{z})(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\vec{z}(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the original state underwent the Fourier transform, the transformation \\\\( G(\\\\vec{z}) \\\\), or both from just knowing \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or type of transformations from the endpoint \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the convolutive effects of matrix transformations on the spectral and time-domain properties of the state vector. Multiple transformation paths could lead to identical or indistinguishable endpoints.",
