  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod, denoted by \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To study the effects of external factors, an intervention is modeled by multiplying the initial temperature distribution by a function \\\\(h(x) = e^{-ax}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the original temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) after observing the temperature \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), without knowing if \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied, the altered initial conditions due to the multiplicative intervention affect the inference of \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) based solely on the observation at time \\\\(T\\\\). There are multiple potential initial distributions that could result in the same observed distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\), depending on whether and how \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied.",
