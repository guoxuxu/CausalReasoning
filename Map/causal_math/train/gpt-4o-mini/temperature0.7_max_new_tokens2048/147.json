  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution along a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We inspect the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a Gaussian filter applied in the frequency domain serves as an intervention, will the temperature profile at \\\\( t = T \\\\), where \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), depend only on the original heat equation or also on the filter applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Gaussian filter modifies the Fourier coefficients, influencing the emerging pattern of temperature distribution by attenuating specific frequency components. Hence, the final profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) will depend on both the heat equation's dynamics and the effect of the Gaussian filtering.",
