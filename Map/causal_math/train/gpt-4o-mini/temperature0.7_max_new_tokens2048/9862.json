  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolve according to coupled differential equations. Introducing the Laplace transform, the new dynamics are described by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t) + iy(t))(s) \\\\).\n\nFrom the Laplace domain representation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) used in the time domain without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) encodes information about the entire time-domain function into the complex frequency domain. Without additional constraints or information, several different time-domain functions can share the same Laplace transform, thus initial conditions cannot be uniquely determined.",
