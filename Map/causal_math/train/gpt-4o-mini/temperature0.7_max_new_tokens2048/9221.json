  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. The solution at any time can be transformed using a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and the system is evolved under \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(t) \\\\) at t = T exactly match the Fourier transformation of the state evolved to t = T under \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation is a linear operation and commutes with the linear differential operator \\\\(L\\\\) under the evolution of the system. Thus, applying the Fourier transformation initially or after the system has evolved will yield the same result.",
