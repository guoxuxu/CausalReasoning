  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The evolution of this function over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex-valued matrix. Study the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is a complex matrix.\n\nCan the starting complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be reconstructed from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If it is not known whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately is uncertain because the transformation \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) might have altered original conditions uniquely related to the interactions between \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\).",
