  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to \\\\(u\\\\), resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), and its subsequent evolution.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform can be applied to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) to uniquely recover \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\), assuming it was the initial condition transformed at t = 0, because the Fourier transform is a reversible transformation with unique inverse under suitable conditions on \\\\(u\\\\).",

The transformed state at time T can indicate information about the initial function u(x, 0), but it is unclear if this can be uniquely determined without knowing the precise time at which the Fourier transform was applied.",
