  "Problem": "Analyze a transfer function H(s) in the Laplace transform domain. Consider a linear system characterized by H(s) = 1/(s^2 + as + b), where a and b are constants. Let's study the impact of applying a unit step input U(s) = 1/s, and how it influences the system response.\n\nIf a unit step function U(s) is applied as input at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve under H(s) without further intervention, will the response Y(s) = H(s)U(s) at time t = T be the same as directly applying H(s) to any other s-domain input at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying U(s) results in a specific response shaped by the convolution of U(t) and h(t), the inverse Laplace transform of H(s). The response is uniquely due to the impulse response of the system in time domain, different from responses to inputs other than the step.",
