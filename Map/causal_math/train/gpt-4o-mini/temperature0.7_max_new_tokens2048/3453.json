  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of applying an initial temperature distribution using the transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\) is set and the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without any subsequent modifications, will the temperature distribution at a later time t = T be the same as if a different initial condition was applied, say \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the temperature distribution is sensitive to the initial conditions. Since the solutions to the heat equation involve the diffusion of initial temperatures over time depending on their initial configuration, starting with \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\) compared to \\\\( \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) results in different temperature distributions as time progresses.",
