  "Problem": "Analyze the feedback system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another constant matrix, applied at specific instances.\n\nApplying the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and then letting the system evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which affects the system’s subsequent evolution. Since \\\\( K \\\\) changes the starting point, the trajectory under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) will diverge from that starting from the unmodified \\\\( x_0 \\\\), leading to a generally different state at time T.",
