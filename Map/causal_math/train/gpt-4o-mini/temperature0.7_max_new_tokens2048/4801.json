  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) which is transformed via a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. The function \\\\( f \\\\) maps inputs from a two-dimensional space into the complex plane, and \\\\( g \\\\) transforms these complex numbers over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = f(x_0, y_0) \\\\) at t = 0, and the output is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the mapping of \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) at t = T under \\\\( g^T(z) \\\\) where \\\\( g^T \\\\) denotes the T-th iterate of \\\\( g \\\\), be predictable?",
  "Explanation": "The iterates of the complex transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) can lead to highly unpredictable and sensitive outcomes, depending on the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the parameter c. This often results in chaotic behavior typical in the study of complex dynamics such as that observed in fractals.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The inputs x and y jointly determine z through the function f, which maps them to the complex plane. The complex number z is then transformed by the function g, which takes z and a constant c to produce a new value. The output from g(z) can be iteratively transformed by g, leading to g^T(z), indicating that each iteration depends on the previous output.",
