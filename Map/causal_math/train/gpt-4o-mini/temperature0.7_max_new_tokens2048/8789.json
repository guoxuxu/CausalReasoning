  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's output. Suppose an external operator transforms the function using a unit step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( g(t) = f(t) u(t-a) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( f(t) u(t-a) \\\\) and then transformed by Laplace without further modifications, will \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\) equal \\\\( L[f(t)] \\\\) shifted by a factor related to \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by the unit step function \\\\( u(t-a) \\\\) introduces a shift in the function, represented by a factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) in the Laplace domain. Thus, \\\\( L[g(t)] = e^{-as} L[f(t)] \\\\), showing that the effect on \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\) is a shift related to \\\\( a \\\\).",
