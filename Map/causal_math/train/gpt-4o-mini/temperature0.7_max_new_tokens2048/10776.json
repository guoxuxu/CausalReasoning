  "Problem": "A mechanical system's position as a function of time is determined by the integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p(t) \\\\dot{x} + q(t)x = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) are given functions. We analyze the impact of a control intervention defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = x + ct^2 \\\\) where c is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and assuming some manipulations through \\\\( h(x) \\\\), can we determine what interventions were executed and the values of \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and c?",
  "Explanation": "The final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) provides insufficient information to backtrack explicitly which intervention happened at what time and the specific values applied. Multiple combinations of timings and values of c could result in the same endpoint due to the complex interaction with the integro-differential equation.",
