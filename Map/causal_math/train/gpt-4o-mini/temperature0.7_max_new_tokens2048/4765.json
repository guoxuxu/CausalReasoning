  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function space such that \\\\( L \\\\) represents a Fourier Transformation, and we investigate the impact of an additional operator \\\\( M \\\\) which applies a convolution transformation with a fixed kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Fourier transformation to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) followed by evolution under the convolution operator \\\\( M \\\\) result in the same outcome as applying \\\\( M \\\\) then \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations matters. Applying \\\\( M \\\\) after \\\\( L \\\\) changes how the convolution interacts with the frequency components altered by the Fourier transformation, leading to different outcomes compared to first applying the convolution and then transforming.",
