  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a complex number matrix and z is a complex variable. The function is applied in a system undergoing transformation by a linear operator represented by matrix B. We evaluate the relationship between the application of complex function and how the system evolves over time.\n\nGiven the state of the system at \\\\(z = Z\\\\), can we determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, there is ambiguity regarding the initial state. The nonlinear nature of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) could mean multiple potential starting points \\\\(z_0\\\\), leading to the same final state \\\\(Z\\\\) under operator \\\\(B\\\\).",
