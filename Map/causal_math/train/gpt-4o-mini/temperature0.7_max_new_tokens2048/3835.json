  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function impacts a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\\\), with D being a constant matrix.\n\nAssuming an intervention is made by changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and given that the system continues according to \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\\\), will the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (T > t_1) only depend on \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) will depend on both the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the altered frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\). The effects of the initial segment of evolution under \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can still influence the system's trajectory even after changing to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\).",
