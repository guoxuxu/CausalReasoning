  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} ds \\\\), which is an integral transformation. We assess the behavior and relationships of this function under different transformations \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( z \\\\mapsto z + a \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real positive number, and then \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is computed, will the result always be bounded?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( z \\\\) by adding a positive real constant \\\\( a \\\\) ensures the real part of \\\\( z \\\\) is positive or increases, leading the exponential function \\\\( e^{-sz} \\\\) to decay more strongly, ensuring the integral is always bounded.",
