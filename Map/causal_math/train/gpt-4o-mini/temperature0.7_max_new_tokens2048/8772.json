  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the causal effects using the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), which transforms this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven a modified signal’s Laplace Transform, can we determine both the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the damping factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) introduced during the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the modified Laplace Transform at \\\\( s = -\\alpha + i\\omega \\\\) allows us to separately identify both the damping factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) (from the real part) and the angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) (from the imaginary part), thus uniquely determining both parameters from the intervention.",
