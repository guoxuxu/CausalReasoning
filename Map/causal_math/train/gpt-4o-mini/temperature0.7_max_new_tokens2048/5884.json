  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a circular path in the complex plane at a fixed radius of 1, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We examine the change in trajectory when this function is altered with a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t.\n\nKnowing the position in the complex plane at time T, can we specifically determine whether the function was squared, and if so, at what times between 0 and T?",
  "Explanation": "The information given by the complex value at T doesn't uniquely reveal if or when an intervention occurred due to the continuity and periodicity of the exponential function. Multiple scenarios of squaring and non-squaring, at various times, may lead to the same final complex value at T.",
