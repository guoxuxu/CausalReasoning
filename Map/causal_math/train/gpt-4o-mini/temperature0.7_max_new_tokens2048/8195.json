  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex number. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) transforms the system at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another constant complex number) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on the original transformation \\\\( P \\\\) and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another level of complexity to the system, affecting the ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Since both Q and R influence the dynamics through their own exponential transformations, the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on P, Q, and R.",
