  "Problem": "Investigate a control system where the growth rate of a population \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\), with r being a growth constant. An intervention is performed using a function \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), where k is another constant, to modify the instantaneous growth rate at a specific time point.\n\nIf the population \\\\( y_0 \\\\) is set at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\) without any intervention, will the population at time t = T be equal to \\\\( y_0 e^{rT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of intervention, the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\) with the initial condition \\\\( y(0) = y_0 \\\\) yields \\\\( y(t) = y_0 e^{rT} \\\\). Hence, the population grows exponentially without deviations.",
