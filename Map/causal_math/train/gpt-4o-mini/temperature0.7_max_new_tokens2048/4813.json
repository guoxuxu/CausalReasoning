  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The function evaluates the transformation of complex functions in the complex plane and further examines how transformations such as Fourier Transform affects the signal.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( F(w) \\\\), does the transformed function \\\\( F(w) \\\\) retain all the properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any distortion?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform maps the function from the time to the frequency domain. The process can distort certain properties (e.g., time-localization of information in \\\\( f(z) \\\\)) unless attributes such as absolute integrability are met by \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Some properties might be preserved like energy or bandwidth under specific conditions but not universally.",
