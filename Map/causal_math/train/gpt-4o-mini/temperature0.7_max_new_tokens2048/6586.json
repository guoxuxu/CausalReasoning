  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant input voltage \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and a resistive load R. A time-varying inductance \\\\( L(t) = L_0 e^{kt} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) through the circuit over time.\n\nBy measuring the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine the initial inductance \\\\( L_0 \\\\) without knowing that the inductance was time-varying?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the time variation in inductance, we lack critical information about how the impedance changed over time, making it impossible to accurately backtrack to the initial conditions solely based on observing \\\\( I(T) \\\\).",
