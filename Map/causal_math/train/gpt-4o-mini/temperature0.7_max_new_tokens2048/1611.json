  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), yielding a new function defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the functional relation \\\\( s \\\\) as it affects the behavior of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) over the complex s-plane.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t = t_0 \\\\), a scaling function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) is applied to the output of the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{t} \\\\), will \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) be independent of the parameter used in the exponential function \\\\( e^{t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with scaling by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) not only modifies the input to the Laplace transform but also affects how the parameters of the exponential function influence the transformed function. Specifically, scaling by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) impacts the Laplace domain outcome, adding additional poles and affecting its convergence, causing it to now depend on how \\\\( t \\\\) scales the exponential growth of the function.",
