  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\), where \\( p \\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effects of changing \\( p \\) and the impact of convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) represented by its transform \\( G(s) = e^{-qs} \\), where \\( q \\) is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the resultant function after the convolution of \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\), can we uniquely determine the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) only from the final transform?",
  "Explanation": "Determining both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) uniquely from the resultant transform is generally not possible without additional information. The convolution integrates the effects of both transforms, leading to a compounded result that might not uniquely indicate the individual parameters.",
