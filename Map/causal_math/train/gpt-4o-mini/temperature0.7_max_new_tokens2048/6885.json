  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). This changes the function domain and potentially the system dynamics.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 undergoes no change but evolves under the original system dynamics, will the Laplace transform of the outcome at a later time, \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\), be the same as directly applying the Laplace transform to the initial condition evolved with time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation defined by the Laplace transform is linear and interacts with the complex exponentials in a predictable way. Since \\\\( L(e^{At}z_0)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A}z_0 \\\\), directly applying the transform to the evolved function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) yields the same result due to linearity and properties of transforms of exponential functions.",
