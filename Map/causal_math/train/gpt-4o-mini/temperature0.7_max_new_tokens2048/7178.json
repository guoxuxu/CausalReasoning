  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex vectors and A and B are constant complex matrices. We explore the outcome when applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[w] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-Ct}w(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) for a fixed time T, where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we uniquely recover the initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) by observing the output of \\\\( T[w] \\\\) at time T, without specific knowledge of if transformation was originally applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the output of the transformation, without explicit knowledge of whether the integral transformation was applied and if it involved matrix C, it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). The transformation integrates and modifies the influence of matrices A, B, and C in ways that do not allow for a unique inversion.",
