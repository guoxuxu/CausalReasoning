  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform, subjected to a filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then converted back using the inverse Fourier transform. Let's denote the output signal as \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(s) \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t))) \\\\).\n\nIf another filtering process \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied to the signal at a certain time before applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) remain unchanged compared to a scenario with only \\\\( H(s) \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an additional filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of the signal before it is further processed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). This additional transformation alters the spectrum of the signal, thus changing the resultant output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), dependent on both \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The signal x(t) is transformed by the Fourier transform, which produces its frequency representation. This frequency representation is then filtered by H(s), affecting the signal's characteristics. The output signal y(t) is generated by applying the inverse Fourier transform to the filtered signal. If another filter G(s) is applied before H(s), the output signal y(t) will differ from the scenario where only H(s) is applied due to the additional filtering effect introduced by G(s).",
