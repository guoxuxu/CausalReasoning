  "Problem": "Consider a vibrational system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\zeta \\\\) is the damping ratio and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the natural frequency. We study the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) = (e^{At}x, e^{At}\\\\dot{x}) \\\\), where A is a scalar.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( (x_0, \\\\dot{x}_0) \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( (x(t), \\\\dot{x}(t)) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\), the transformation by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) could have altered both position and velocity in a way that is not distinguishable at time T given the influence of the damping and natural frequency on the system's dynamics.",
