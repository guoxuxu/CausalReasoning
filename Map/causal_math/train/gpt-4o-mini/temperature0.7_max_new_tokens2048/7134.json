  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. For this scenario, let's investigate the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined as an integral transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan the original constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be uniquely determined by knowing only the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T and without the knowledge of Fourier transform application?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T} z_0 \\\\), and knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\), one can determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) since \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be extracted by analyzing the argument of the complex exponential change relative to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
