  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) representing heat flow in a medium where L is a differential operator. We look at the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) during the evolution.\n\nGiven the evolved system state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T, can we precisely infer the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition may have been transformed by the kernel of \\\\( T(u) \\\\), modifying the feasible distribution of heat. Without knowledge of this application, multiple initial functions could lead to the same state at t = T due to the diffusion process.",
