  "Problem": "Consider a control system where temperature regulation is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We study the effect of a sudden shift in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) modeled by the function \\\\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S \\\\), where \\\\( H(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside step function, and \\\\( S \\\\) is a constant shift.\n\nCan it be determined if a shift in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) occurred, or if the cooling system set the temperature independently based on the final observed temperature?",
  "Explanation": "Since the cooling system can maintain a constant temperature regardless of environmental changes, the final observed temperature does not reveal whether an original shift occurred in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) or if the temperature was directly set by the cooling system without an environmental shift.",
