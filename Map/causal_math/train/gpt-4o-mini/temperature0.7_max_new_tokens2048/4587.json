  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x)e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x)\\\\) is a spatial profile and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of oscillation. The function represents a wave-like solution to the wave equation. We apply a Fourier transform in time, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\), to derive frequency domain characteristics and investigate potential changes induced by a spatial transformation \\\\(G(x) = x^2\\\\).\n\nIf an additional spatial transformation \\\\(H(x) = \\\\sqrt{x}\\\\) is applied at a later time \\\\(t=T\\\\), will the resulting wave function \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) retain the initial frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the application of an additional spatial transformation, the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) intrinsic to the temporal part of the wave function remains unchanged. Such transformations modify spatial characteristics but do not influence the temporal frequency set by \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).",
