  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic process described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\(s(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s)(p) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-pt} s(t) dt\\\\), where t is time and p is a complex variable. We explore the effects of modifying this function by a convolution with another function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) defined in the time domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\(s(t)\\\\) is convoluted with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) forming \\\\(s*h(t)\\\\), and then its Laplace transform is taken, will the transformed function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s*h)(p)\\\\) be the same as the product of the Laplace transforms of \\\\(s\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\) individually, i.e., \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s)(p) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(p)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the convolution theorem in the context of Laplace transforms, the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is equal to the product of their Laplace transforms. Thus, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s*h)(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}(s)(p) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(p)\\\\).",
