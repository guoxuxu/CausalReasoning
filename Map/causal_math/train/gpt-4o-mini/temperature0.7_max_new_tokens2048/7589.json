  "Problem": "Evaluate the system of differential equations characterized by the Laplace transform of functions and their inverse. Let \\\\( X(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of a function x(t), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) the transfer function of a linear system. The response of the system is given by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nDoes modifying \\\\( X(s) \\\\) by scaling it with a factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) prior to input into the system defined by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) change the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) compared to scaling \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) after the system processing?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling \\\\( X(s) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) before the transformation and scaling \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) after the system processes it are equivalent due to the linearity of the system and the properties of the Laplace transform. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) remains proportionally the same in both cases.",
