  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\( x' = Dx \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Study the effect of the transformation \\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\) over time t, where L is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a function \\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\) (where M is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on L or M?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention with \\( h(x) \\) changes the trajectory in a way that depends not only on D but also significantly on L and M. The matrix \\( e^{Mt} \\) introduces new dynamics, interplaying with the previous transformations \\( e^{Lt} \\) and the diagonalization by S.",
