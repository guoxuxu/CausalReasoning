  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to exactly deduce which transformations (either \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied knowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from a variety of sequences or combinations of transformations by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Due to the non-linear changes to magnitude and phase introduced by both transformations, distinguishing between them based solely on the endpoint without additional temporal data is infeasible.",
