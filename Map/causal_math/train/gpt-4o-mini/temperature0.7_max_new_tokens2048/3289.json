  "Problem": "Analyze the interplay of linear transformations and differential operators in a vector space. Assume we have a set of equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. Then, explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\), where R is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\) changes the initial state of the vector, which modifies the trajectory of the system. Although the subsequent evolution obeys \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), the initial application of R makes the final state at time T different due to the changed starting conditions.",
