  "Problem": "Consider a calculation involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The calculation examines the integral transformation across time t defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\int_0^T z(t) \\, dt \\\\) and impacts of interventions at different stages.\n\nIf, midway through the interval, a phase shift of \\\\( \\pi/2 \\\\) radians is introduced to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), altering it to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i (\\omega t + \\pi/2)} \\\\) for the remaining half of the interval, will the result of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) still be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a phase shift midway through the evaluation affects the symmetry and the periodicity of the integral over the full interval. The first half and the second half of the integral now cover different phases of the sinusoidal function, not canceling each other out completely, leading to a non-zero result for \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",
