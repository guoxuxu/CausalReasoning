  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, y) u(y, t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nKnowing the outcome \\\\( w(x, T) \\\\), can one specify which transformations (\\\\( v \\\\) or \\\\( w \\\\) or both) were applied during the evolution, based solely on \\\\( w(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in effects due to the convolution-like operations inherent in the integral transformations with different kernels makes it difficult to pinpoint precisely what transformations were applied. Different combinations of contributions from K and M can lead to the same end result \\\\( w(x, T) \\\\), rendering it ambiguous.",
