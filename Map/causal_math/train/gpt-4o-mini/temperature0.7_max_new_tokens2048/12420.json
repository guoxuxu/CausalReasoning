  "Problem": "In a stochastic process, the change in a variable X is governed by the differential equation \\\\( dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is the drift coefficient, \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is the volatility coefficient, and \\\\( dW_t \\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We study how the application of a transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) impacts the process over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the given stochastic differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( X^2(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( X_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the stochastic differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) alters the initial condition of the process. The square of the initial value, \\\\( X^2_0 \\\\), will follow a different stochastic path due to the non-linear transformation impacting the drift and diffusion terms, leading to a different outcome for \\\\( X^2(t) \\\\) at time T.",
