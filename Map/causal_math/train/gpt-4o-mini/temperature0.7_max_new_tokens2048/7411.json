  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) which is a mapping from the complex plane to itself, given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The time evolution of a system is initially influenced by the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\), then governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\), where c is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\phi z} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a different real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on c and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another modification to the state of the system through another complex exponential factor. This causes the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to depend on both the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), in addition to the differential equation parameter c.",
