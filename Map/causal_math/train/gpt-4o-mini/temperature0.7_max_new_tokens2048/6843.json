  "Problem": "We consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) where \\( t \\) is time and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. Using an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform, we wish to analyze how modifications to the original function impact its behavior over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention by multiplying \\( z(t) \\) with another complex exponential \\( e^{at} \\) (where \\( a \\) is a constant complex number) is applied, will the resulting function \\( z'(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on the original function and not on \\( a \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) by introducing a new factor \\( e^{at} \\), making \\( z'(t) = e^{(i+a)t} \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\). This change alters the fundamental frequency and behavior of the original function, depending crucially on \\( a \\).",
