  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent real function and \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the influence of this transformation where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function having both amplitude modulation and phase shift properties based on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\).\n\nIs it feasible to reconstruct the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at every point t from 0 to T by solely observing the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency parameter \\\\( w \\\\) critically influences the transformation such that without knowing \\\\( w \\\\), the phase shift imposed by \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) cannot be decoupled accurately, making it impossible to retrieve \\\\( x(t) \\\\) exactly from \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
