  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze whether certain transformations can infer causal relationships or predict the system's behavior accurately.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to a phase shift transformation \\\\( z'(t) = z(t)e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\) at t = 0, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant phase shift, and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be different from \\\\( z(T)e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\) is a linear operator that commutes with the time evolution operator \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Therefore, the transformation merely adjusts the initial phase, and the final conditions at any time T will still align with applying the phase shift directly to \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
