  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{Y(s)}{s - P} \\\\), where \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of the output variable y(t) and P is a constant pole. An input function is defined as \\\\( u(t) = e^{Dt} \\\\) where D is a constant. The system's response is altered by applying the Laplace transform of the input.\n\nIf \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied to the system at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics \\\\( L\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{Y(s)}{s - P} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) eventually only depend on \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) excluding \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) modifies the input conditions, resulting in an altered system response. As \\\\( D \\\\) influences the overall Laplace transform, \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) will also depend on \\\\( D \\\\) in addition to \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\).",
