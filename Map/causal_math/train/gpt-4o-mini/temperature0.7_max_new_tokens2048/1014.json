  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the relationship between applying the Laplace transform on \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and its inverse, and how transformations like matrix exponentiation affect this process.\n\nCan we determine the matrix A by observing the output of the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(x)) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the inverse Laplace transform returns us to our original function \\\\( e^{Ax} \\\\), and knowing the functional form of the output allows us to determine the matrix A, as it is directly linked to the structure of the exponentiated matrix in the function.",
