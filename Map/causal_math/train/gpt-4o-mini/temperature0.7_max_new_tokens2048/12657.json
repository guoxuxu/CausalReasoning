  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in control theory, described by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \\\\), where \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) are polynomial functions of the complex variable s. We investigate the behavior of the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) when the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is subjected to the Fourier Transform of a step function, i.e., \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) after input \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\), can we determine the specific form of \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) in the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific polynomials \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) alone, as various combinations of these polynomials could produce the same overall transfer function behavior, particularly if only the output for a single input type (like a step function) is known.",
