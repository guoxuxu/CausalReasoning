  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function transformation on real function space, considering the integral transform \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\). The analysis focuses on the Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( F(a)(x) = \\\\frac{1}{a + ix} \\\\), can we infer the exact form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) (i.e., \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\)) based solely on the transformed result and assuming no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) uniquely results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{a + ix} \\\\) in the Fourier transform setting, we can uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) from its transformation, assuming no intervention altered \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
