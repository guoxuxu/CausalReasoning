  "Problem": "Consider a system that is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a vector field representing velocity. We investigate how performing a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), affects the evolution of the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\) is calculated at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) evolves under the given partial differential equation, will the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) simply be the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform linearizes the convective derivative term, transferring the problem to the frequency domain where the equation becomes easier to handle, and then the inverse Fourier transform brings it back to the spatial domain unchanged as long as the governing equations and conditions are preserved.",
