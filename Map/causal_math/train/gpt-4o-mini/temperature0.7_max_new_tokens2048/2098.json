  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) the initial complex value. We explore how a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex number, influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nBy observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can you precisely infer the starting value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if unaware whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is not possible to reliably trace back to the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could have changed the starting value, leading to multiple possible initial states that could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
