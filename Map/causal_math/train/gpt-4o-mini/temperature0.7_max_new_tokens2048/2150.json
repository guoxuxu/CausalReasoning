  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane and governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is not possible to accurately backtrack to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the potential alteration by the complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\gamma t} \\\\), which affects both the magnitude and the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
