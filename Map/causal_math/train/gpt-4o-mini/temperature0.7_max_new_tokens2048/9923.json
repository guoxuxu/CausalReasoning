  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) defined in a one-dimensional space. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform applied to u(x,0) to analyze the wave's behavior.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filtering operation represented by a function \\\\( h(k) \\\\) is applied to the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t_1)\\\\), will the characteristics of the wave at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter function \\\\( h(k) \\\\) modifies the spectral components at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), hence the future state of the wave \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for t > t_1 will depend on both the original conditions and the effects of the filtering, altering the evolution path prescribed by the wave equation.",
