  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit comprising an inductor \\(L\\), capacitor \\(C\\), and resistor \\(R\\), governing the charge \\(Q\\) on the capacitor. The dynamics of \\(Q\\) are described by the second-order differential equation \\(L \\ddot{Q} + R \\dot{Q} + \\frac{Q}{C} = 0\\). We examine the effect of a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) introduced into the circuit at different times.\n\nIf a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) is applied from time \\(t = 0\\), does the system still follow the natural response induced originally by the RLC combination for all future times?",
  "Explanation": "When the voltage source is applied, it alters the free oscillations of the circuit defined by its characteristic natural frequency. The resulting behavior is a forced response superimposed on the natural response, comprising both the natural characteristics and the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the applied source.",
