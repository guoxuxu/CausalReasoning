  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a constant complex vector. We are interested in evaluating the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nCan we uniquely recover the value of w from the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if we do not apply the transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) was not applied, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will simply be \\\\( e^{iAT} w \\\\). This allows recovery of w by applying the inverse \\\\( e^{-iAT} \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) provided that the evolution was pure and no other transformations were applied.",
