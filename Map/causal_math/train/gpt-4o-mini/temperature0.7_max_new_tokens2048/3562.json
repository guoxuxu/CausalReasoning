  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents temperature distribution in a material and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To test the effect of a spatial transformation, let's apply a rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) to the spatial coordinates.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely determine if a spatial rotation by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) was applied at t=0 without any other knowledge?",
  "Explanation": "The heat distribution at time \\\\( t \\\\) is a function of both the initial conditions and the diffusive properties of the system. Different initial distributions could evolve into similar distributions at time \\\\( t \\\\) due to symmetry in the diffusion process, making it impossible to uniquely determine the initial rotation.",
