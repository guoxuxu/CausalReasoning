  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system state over time, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. Here, A and B are constant matrices. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) = x(T) + iy(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under their respective differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), which changes the trajectory of both components, \\\\( x_t \\\\) and \\\\( y_t \\\\). Since the exponential component can affect both real and imaginary parts differently depending on C, the resultant state at time T will be different.",
