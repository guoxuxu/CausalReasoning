  "Problem": "In a stochastic process, the change in a variable X is governed by the differential equation \\\\( dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is the drift coefficient, \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is the volatility coefficient, and \\\\( dW_t \\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We study how the application of a transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) impacts the process over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine which transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(X) \\\\), \\\\( k(X) \\\\), or both) during the process, only by knowing \\\\( X(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different sequences or types of transformations due to the nonlinear effects on the stochastic path. These transformations and their sequence play a significant role in shaping the trajectory, and without additional information, one cannot uniquely determine what transformations were applied.",
