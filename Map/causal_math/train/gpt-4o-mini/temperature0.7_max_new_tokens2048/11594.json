  "Problem": "Analyze the interaction between a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\) and a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(v) \\\\) applied to vector \\\\( v \\\\) in Euclidean space. Matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is constant, and the Fourier transform operates on function space representations of \\\\( v \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( v \\\\) from the output of the sequence of Fourier transform then linear transformation without knowing whether the original operation was linear transformation followed by Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed output after a Fourier transform and a subsequent linear transformation, pinpointing whether the initial operation was a linear or Fourier transformation first would be highly challenging. The transformations encapsulate complex changes which are not easily reversible, especially without explicit information about the order and the specific transformations applied.",
