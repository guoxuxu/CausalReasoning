  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\. Over time, the function describes a circular trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can we unambiguously determine the initial complex value \\\\( x \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation is a pure rotation, knowing \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}x \\\\) allows us to uniquely backtrack the rotation to determine \\\\( x \\\\) as \\\\( x = e^{-iAT}z(T) \\\\), thus retrieving the original complex number.",
