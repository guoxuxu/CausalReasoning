  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where ω is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. A Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(ω) = \\\\int_{-∞}^{∞} z(t) e^{-iωt} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform without any alteration in its functional form, will the transform \\\\( F(ω) \\\\) exhibit a delta function at frequency \\\\( ω \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the Fourier transform of sinusoidal functions, transforming \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) results in a delta function precisely at the original frequency \\\\( ω \\\\). This is characteristic of the Fourier transform's response to pure sinusoidal inputs.",
