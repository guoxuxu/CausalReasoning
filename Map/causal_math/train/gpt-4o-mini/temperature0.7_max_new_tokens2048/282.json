  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time and i is the imaginary unit. This function describes a unit circle in the complex plane. We study the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) where A is a complex number, representing multiplication and rotation in the complex plane.\n\nCan we deduce the initial transformation \\\\( A \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by observing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without any prior knowledge of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the initial transformation with A, the observed state \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\) could be misleading because any number of transformations (different As) could lead to the same observed outcome on the unit circle, given their periodic nature.",
