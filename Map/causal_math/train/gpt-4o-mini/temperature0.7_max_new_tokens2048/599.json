  "Problem": "Consider a system of first-order differential equations where the rate of change of a vector function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\), with \\\\(M\\\\) being a constant matrix and \\\\(N\\\\) a constant vector. The system is affected by a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = Qz + R \\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(R\\\\) a constant vector.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new function \\\\( h(z) = Sz + T \\\\) (where S is a constant matrix, and T is a constant vector) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and N, not on Q, R, S, or T?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the system's evolution. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes a result of how both transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) influence the system in conjunction with the dynamic dictated by \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\). Thus, it depends on all parameters: M, N, Q, R, S, and T.",
