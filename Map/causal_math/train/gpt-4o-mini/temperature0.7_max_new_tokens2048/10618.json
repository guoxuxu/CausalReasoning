  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where z is a complex-valued function of a real variable t, and A is a constant complex square matrix. We evaluate causal relationships and transformations involving the perturbation function \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf we observe \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine if the initial condition was transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or if it started from z_0?",
  "Explanation": "Given just the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and depending on the properties of matrices A and C, it is often not possible to definitely distinguish whether the initial condition was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\). The influence of the exponential matrix function and the initial condition being potentially scaled by C makes it ambiguous.",
