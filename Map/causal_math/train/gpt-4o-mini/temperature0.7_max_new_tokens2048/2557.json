  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in a complex plane, described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. We introduce a transformation given by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, affecting the amplitude and phase of \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, does the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T differ from the trajectory if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling and potentially rotating \\\\( z_0 \\\\), depending on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\). The evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) then proceeds from this altered state, leading to a distinctly different trajectory characterized by altered amplitude and phase.",
