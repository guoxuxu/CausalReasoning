  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x)e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x)\\\\) is a spatial profile and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of oscillation. The function represents a wave-like solution to the wave equation. We apply a Fourier transform in time, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\), to derive frequency domain characteristics and investigate potential changes induced by a spatial transformation \\\\(G(x) = x^2\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\(t=0\\\\) we apply the transformation \\\\(G(x)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x)\\\\) to obtain \\\\(u'(x) = u(x^2)\\\\), and then let the wave evolve normally, does the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) change as a result?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the wave function \\\\(z(x,t)\\\\) is determined by the temporal part \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) and is not affected by transformations applied to the spatial profile \\\\(u(x)\\\\). Although the spatial profile changes, the frequency component remains the same as it is a property inherent to the temporal part of the solution.",
