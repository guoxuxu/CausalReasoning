  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), in which z is a complex variable, A is a real number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The transformation applies to study the effect of rotations in the complex plane under different time transformations.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the rotation operator \\\\( e^{iAT} \\\\), can we retrieve the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if any alteration in form occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The mapping is reversible as long as the rotation angle (AT) is known, allowing for a precise computation of \\\\( z_0 = e^{-iAT} z(T) \\\\), thus effectively retrieving the initial state from the final state under unaltered progression.",
