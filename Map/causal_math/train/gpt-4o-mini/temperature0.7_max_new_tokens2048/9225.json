  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with time evolution defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An operator transformation given by \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and this new state is subsequently evolved over time under \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if we had directly evolved \\\\( y_0 \\\\) under \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\) for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( y_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Cy_0 \\\\). Therefore, the resulting state is \\\\( e^{AT}(Cy_0) \\\\) instead of \\\\( e^{AT}y_0 \\\\). For most matrices A and C, \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) do not commute, thus \\\\( e^{AT}(Cy_0) \\\\neq e^{AT}y_0 \\\\).",
