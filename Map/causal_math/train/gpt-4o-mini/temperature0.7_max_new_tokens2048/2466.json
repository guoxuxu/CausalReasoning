  "Problem": "Consider a periodic signal described by the function \\\\( v(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi) \\\\). The signal undergoes various modifications using a linear operator represented by \\\\( L \\\\) that performs a convolution with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specifically designed to alter phase and amplitude.\n\nObserving the transformed signal \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine precisely the original phase \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and amplitude \\\\( A \\\\) of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) without knowing the kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), reverse-engineering to \\\\( v(t) \\\\)'s original parameters such as phase and amplitude is impractical. Different kernels could yield similar transformations rendering the original signal parameters indeterminate.",
