  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform in space, given by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t)\\\\), on the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0 without further information on the intervening time evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\), combined with knowledge of the heat equation and the properties of thermal diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\), allows the reconstruction of \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\). The heat equation is deterministic and reversible in this context under Fourier transform, making it possible to find the initial state from the final state.",
