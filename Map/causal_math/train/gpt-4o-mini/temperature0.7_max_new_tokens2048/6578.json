  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x \\) a constant vector in complex space. The function transforms \\( z(t) \\) using an operator \\( T \\) defined as \\( Tz = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another constant matrix and \\( T \\) is a fixed terminal time.\n\nKnowing the result \\( Tz \\) and assuming no other intervention than the initial transformation \\( T \\), can we infer the original \\( x \\) from the outcome \\( Tz \\) at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T \\) involves an integration which blends the effects of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) over the interval from 0 to \\( T \\). Without additional information on \\( A \\) or \\( B \\), or the specifics of their interaction over \\( t \\), \\( x \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( Tz \\).",
