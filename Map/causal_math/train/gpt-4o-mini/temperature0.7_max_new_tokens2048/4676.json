  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the displacement vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time t is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by the function \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), on the system behavior.\n\nGiven the processed output \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( F(x) \\\\), \\\\( G(x) \\\\), or both), just by observing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used is not directly feasible from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone due to the overlapping effects of different transformation methods on the system's behavior, leading to indistinguishable final states under various transformation scenarios.",
