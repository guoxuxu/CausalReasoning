  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region, and let \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) represent the potential at a point (x, y). The Fourier transformation is applied to \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\), creating a transformed function \\\\(U(k, y)\\\\) dependent on wavenumber k and y.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original potential distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) from the transformed potential \\\\(U(k, Y)\\\\) observed at y = Y using inverse Fourier transform without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Under the assumptions of linearity and absence of sources or sinks, the Fourier transformation and its inverse are sufficient to recover \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) from \\\\(U(k, Y)\\\\), assuming the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) solely determines the evolution.",
