  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = xe^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. The transformation \\(\\ T : z \\mapsto z^2 \\) is applied to this function.\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention \\( I(z) = z + c \\) (where \\( c \\) is a constant) is applied, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) only depend on \\( \\\\omega \\) and not on the initial condition modified by \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( I(z) \\) changes the system, introducing a new constant \\( c \\) which modifies the trajectory furthermore. The final state \\( z(T) \\) will depend on both the original frequency \\( \\\\omega \\), the original transformation \\( T(z) = z^2 \\), and the intervention \\( I(z) \\), making the final state reliant on multiple factors.",
