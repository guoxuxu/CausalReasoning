  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the influence of applying a Fourier transform, where the transform is defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at some frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), is it possible to exactly retrieve the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without any additional information about the parameters or evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform converts the time domain into the frequency domain, blending all temporal information. Therefore, knowledge of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone is insufficient to exactly determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing about the contributions of \\\\( k \\\\) and the dynamics specified by the differential equation.",
