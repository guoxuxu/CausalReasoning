  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), within a system governed by the linear differential operator \\\\( L(z) = \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 z \\\\). Analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the system's state at time T, can we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial state in such a way that the effects cannot be uniquely reversed without knowing the use of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The integration process embeds the initial conditions into a broader function space, obscuring the unique identification of the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
