  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^2 \\\\) defined over the complex numbers, and let \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z e^{w^2} dw \\\\) be an integral transformation. Investigate the implications of this setup where \\\\( z \\\\) evolves as a complex function.\n\nIf \\\\( z \\\\) is modified to \\\\( z' = z + i \\\\) (where \\\\\\\\(i\\\\\\\\) is the imaginary unit) at the initial moment, and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is computed for \\\\( z' \\\\), will the outcome at \\\\( z' \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was computed directly for \\\\( z \\\\) without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by adding \\\\( i \\\\) changes the input to the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and since the transformation involves exponential of squares, it is sensitive to changes in the input. Hence, the output at \\\\( z' \\\\) will differ from the output at \\\\( z \\\\).",
