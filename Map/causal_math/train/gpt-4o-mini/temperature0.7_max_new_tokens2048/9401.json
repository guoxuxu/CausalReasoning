  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate the causality in the changes of original function and its behavior under various transformations.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an exponential function like \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) where a is a real number, will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f) \\\\) change essentially if we modify \\\\( a \\\\) slightly?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( a \\\\) affects the decay or growth rate of the function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), which fundamentally alters the responses of its Laplace transform, shifting the pole of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the complex plane. The Laplace transform will therefore change essentially.",
