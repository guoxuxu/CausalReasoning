  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation through a Laplace Transform given by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). The impact of manipulating \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) (a complex number in the Laplace Transform) on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is studied.\n\nIf \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is increased, and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is computed without further intervention, will the convergence region of the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) change?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) affects the oscillatory component of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which changes the behavior in the frequency domain. The convergence of the Laplace Transform is dependent on the real part of \\\\( s \\\\) relative to \\\\( \\omega \\\\), hence the region of convergence will shift, reflecting this change in frequency.",
