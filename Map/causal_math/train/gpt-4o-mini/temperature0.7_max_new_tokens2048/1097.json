  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform, having a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. This scenario explores causal inference in system responses by examining different excitation functions and their respective impacts.\n\nIf an impulse function \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) is applied to the system resulting in an output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and assuming no further intervention in the system, will the output be purely the impulse response of the system \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from an impulse input \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) in a linear time-invariant system is the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), as described by the property of the Laplace Transform. The system's behavior follows directly from the definition of the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
