  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function over the complex plane given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_C g(s) e^{zs} ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is a complex-analytical function. We examine the effects of modifying the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( h(s) \\\\), thus making it \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is replaced by \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\) in the transformation, will \\\\( F(z) \\\\) for a fixed \\\\( z \\\\) and contour \\\\( C \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( g(s) \\\\) was unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( g(s) \\\\) to \\\\( g(s)h(s) \\\\) changes the integrand and therefore the result of the integral transformation. The new function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) can alter the characteristics of the integral, leading to a different computed value of \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",
