  "Problem": "Consider a system which can be modeled by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), shifting through complex numbers in a unit circle over time. An external transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nKnowing the path \\\\(z(T) = ce^{iT}\\\\) at any time \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine if the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By examining the magnitude of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), which is \\\\(|c|\\\\), we can infer if \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) was applied. If \\\\(|c|\\\\) is not equal to 1, it indicates that the transformation modifying the initial unit magnitude was applied.",
