  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + k^2 u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( U(k) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( U(k) \\\\) at a certain time, can we uniquely determine the spatial function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = 0 without knowing the initial condition explicitly?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, since the Fourier transform is a bijective transformation for sufficiently well-behaved functions. Knowing \\\\( U(k) \\\\) allows reconstruction of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier transform, assuming \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and its derivatives decay sufficiently at infinity.",
