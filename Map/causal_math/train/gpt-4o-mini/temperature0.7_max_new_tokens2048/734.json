  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We study the implications of applying a transformation denoted by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on this system dynamics.\n\nIf we observe the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any additional context?",
  "Explanation": "Without further context, particularly on the initial state or the presence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is not possible to retroactively deduce the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The same observed outcome at time T, such as \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\), could result from multiple initial conditions or transformations, depending on the angle and the doubling effect.",
