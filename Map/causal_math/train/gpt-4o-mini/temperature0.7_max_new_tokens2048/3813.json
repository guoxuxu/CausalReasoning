  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We examine the interactions between the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and a linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) on function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf the linear operator \\( L \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve over time without further function manipulation, will the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[Lz(t)] \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as the Fourier transform directly applied to the evolved \\( z(t) \\) under the same conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( L \\) to \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) results in \\( Lz(t) = t e^{i\\omega t} \\). The Fourier transform of \\( Lz(t) \\) involves differentiating the original transform, which includes a frequency shift and scaling, differing significantly from the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) without applying \\( L \\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear operator L to z(t) results in Lz(t), which is then transformed by the Fourier transform to yield \\mathcal{F}[Lz(t)].
