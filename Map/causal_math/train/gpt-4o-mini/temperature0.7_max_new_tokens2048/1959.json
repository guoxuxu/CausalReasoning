  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time, representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. An integral transformation defined as \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number is applied.\n\nIf at t = T/2, an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + ce^{Dt} \\\\) where D is another constant and c a constant vector, will \\\\( w(T) \\\\) still be primarily determined by the original matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) mid-evolution modifies the integral by adding a component that evolves according to a different rule (\\\\( ce^{Dt} \\\\)). Hence, \\\\( w(T) \\\\) reflects both the influence of A and the effects of D, creating a compounded effect driven by both matrices.",
