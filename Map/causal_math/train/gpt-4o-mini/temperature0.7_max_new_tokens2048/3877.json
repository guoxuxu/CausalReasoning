  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) on a rod extending from \\\\(x=0\\\\) to \\\\(x=L\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature at point \\\\(x\\\\) at time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\) and its modification via a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[f](k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx}dx\\\\).\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution is transformed by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[f](k)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was directly evolved under the heat equation without applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition with the Fourier transform and then applying the inverse transform alters the initial profile by restructuring its frequency components. Although both profiles will diffuse over time, their precise distributions at time \\\\(T\\\\) will differ unless \\\\(f\\\\) is composed solely of modes supported by the solution to the heat equation.",
