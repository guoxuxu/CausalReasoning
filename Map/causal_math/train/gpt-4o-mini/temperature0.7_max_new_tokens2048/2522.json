  "Problem": "Assume the function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) given by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\). Evaluate results and transformations within the complex plane, specifically considering the impact of modifications by linear transformations represented by complex constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\(w\\\\) from the function \\\\(e^{z}\\\\), can we deduce exactly which \\\\(z\\\\) was used to generate \\\\(w\\\\) without knowing if any linear transformation by a complex constant was applied prior to function application?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of a prior transformation, and given the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane (specifically, the \\\\(2\\\\pi i\\\\) periodicity), multiple different inputs could lead to the same output. This ambiguity is compounded if unknown linear transformations are considered, which could place the initial \\\\(z\\\\) in different forms.",
