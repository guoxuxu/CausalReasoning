  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and its impact under a Fourier transformation, specifically looking at \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nObserving only the Fourier transform output of a manipulated \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we decide whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) or another transformation was applied before the Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform output can be substantially similar for different preliminary transformations applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), especially given the diverse effects these transformations can have on the function. Without specific knowledge of what transformation was applied, distinguishing based purely on the Fourier transform result is generally infeasible.",
