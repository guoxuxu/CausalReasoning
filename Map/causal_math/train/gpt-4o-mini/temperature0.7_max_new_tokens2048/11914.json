  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex domain, defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane. Evaluate the transformations on this function using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), where the Laplace transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf a modulation by another function \\\\( u(t) = e^{2it} \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the Laplace transform of the resulting function is taken, will the endpoint in the Laplace domain be purely a result of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the modulation function \\\\( u(t) = e^{2it} \\\\) affects the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed function of \\\\( e^{3it} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function will reflect the influence of both original and introduced functions, displaying characteristics distinct from the Laplace transform of the unmodulated \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
