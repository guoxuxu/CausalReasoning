  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing position in 2D space over time t. Transformations are applied via \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without confirmation whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing the initial position \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous. The function \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) could have altered the trajectory significantly, thus without this knowledge, accurate inference of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is mathematically infeasible.",
