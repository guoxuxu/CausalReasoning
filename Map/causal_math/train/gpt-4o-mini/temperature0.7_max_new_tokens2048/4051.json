  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) of a function u(t), where u(t) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + 5u = 0 \\\\). Consider an intervention where a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) is introduced to the solution u(t) before transforming it.\n\nIf the function u(t) is modified by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) and then transformed using Laplace, will the transformed function \\\\( U(s) \\\\) only depend on the parameters of the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the exponential factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) significantly alters the Laplace transform's outcome. This action effectively changes the function being transformed, leading to a dependency not only on the original equation's parameters but also on the exponential factor used, which introduces additional terms in the transformed function.",
