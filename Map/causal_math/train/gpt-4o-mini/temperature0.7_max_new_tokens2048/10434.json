  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u + iv \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + cz^2 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are constants. We explore the behavior when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t in [0, T], based solely on the knowledge of the transformed function \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at some T > t, without knowing the initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the entire original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) is not feasible without additional information. The transformation involves an integration that inherently loses some information about the specific values that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) took on over the interval [0, T].",
