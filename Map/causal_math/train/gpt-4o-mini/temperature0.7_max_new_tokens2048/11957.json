  "Problem": "Consider a control system where temperature regulation is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We study the effect of a sudden shift in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) modeled by the function \\\\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S \\\\), where \\\\( H(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside step function, and \\\\( S \\\\) is a constant shift.\n\nGiven the observed equilibrium temperature \\\\( T_{eq} \\\\) at a long time after the temperature change, can we deduce the original environmental temperature \\\\( T_{base} \\\\) without knowing \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The relation between the original and altered environmental temperatures involves the shift \\\\( S \\\\), which needs to be known to accurately trace back to \\\\( T_{base} \\\\). Otherwise, multiple possible values for \\\\( T_{base} \\\\) could result in the same equilibrium temperature.",
