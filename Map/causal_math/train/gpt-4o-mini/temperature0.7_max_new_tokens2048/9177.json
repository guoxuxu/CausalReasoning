  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from the evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) alone under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at the initial time modifies the starting value from \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( Bx \\\\). As \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}(Bx) \\\\), the trajectory will differ unless B commutes with \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), which is generally not the case unless \\\\( B \\\\) is a scalar multiple of the identity.",
