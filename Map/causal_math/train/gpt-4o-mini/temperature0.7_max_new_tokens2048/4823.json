  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where f(t) represents a time-dependent function and s is a complex number. An input signal f(t) is being studied for its transformation and response properties under different conditions and manipulations.\n\nIf a time-shift operation defined by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-bt}f(t) \\\\) where b is a real number, is applied to \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) and then transformed, will the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using a time-shift operation modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = e^{(a-b)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function, under the assumption that Re(s) > (a-b), results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\). The intervention clearly alters the transformed function in a predictable way.",
