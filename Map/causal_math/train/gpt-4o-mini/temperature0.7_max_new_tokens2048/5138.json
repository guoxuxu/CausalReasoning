  "Problem": "Let's analyze a discrete system defined using the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of a matrix A. Consider a complex function, \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - \\\\lambda_i} \\\\), applied to each eigenvalue and its effects on solving the integral, \\\\( \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{f(z)}{z - \\\\lambda_i} dz \\\\) where C is a contour encompassing all eigenvalues.\n\nCan you determine the specific eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of matrix A given the result of the integral transformation over \\\\( h(z) \\\\), assuming no other data?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral gives information about residues associated with the poles at \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\). However, without knowing the order of the residues or additional specifics from the integral's regions, determining the exact values of \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) solely based on the transformation's result is ambiguous.",
