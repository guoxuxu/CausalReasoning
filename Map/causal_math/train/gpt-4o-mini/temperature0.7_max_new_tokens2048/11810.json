  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Analyze the response of the function under an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i+c)t} \\\\) at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant, will the outcome \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect the effects of both \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) and the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the behavior of the function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, affecting its growth rate and oscillatory nature due to the additional real exponential component. This alters the integral outcome from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), indicating a causal relationship that includes both the original function and the effect of the intervention.",
