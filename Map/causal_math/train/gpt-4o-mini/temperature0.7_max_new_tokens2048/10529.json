  "Problem": "In the context of a heat conduction problem, assume a rod along the x-axis where the temperature distribution at time t is given by the function \\( u(x,t) \\), which satisfies the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\). We consider an integral transformation \\( f(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-sx}u(x,0) \\, dx \\) (Fourier Transform) and study its impact on the solution when applied initially.\n\nIf \\( f(u) \\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\( u(x,0) \\), and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\( u(x,T) \\) at T be the same as if \\( u(x,0) \\) was directly evolved to T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation's linearity and the properties of the Fourier Transform ensure that transforming the initial condition and then evolving or evolving first and then transforming yields the same result, because of the transformation's linearity and the convolution theorem.",
