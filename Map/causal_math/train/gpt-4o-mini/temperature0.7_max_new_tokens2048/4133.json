  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(x, t) = e^{tx}i\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real parameter, evolving over time according to the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the complex function is applied to \\\\(x\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(x\\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\) without applying \\\\(e^{tx}i\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying \\\\(e^{tx}i\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the initial condition of \\\\(z(x, t)\\\\) is fundamentally altered to \\\\(z(x, 0) = e^{0x}i = i\\\\). The future state \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) evolves from this modified initial condition, influenced by exponential growth driven by \\\\(a\\\\), thus resulting in a state that deviates from the natural evolution of \\\\(x\\\\) without initial transformation.",
