  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt \\\\), which is a Laplace transform of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Explore how modifying the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) affects the transform, and consider the impacts of two types of modifications: multiplication by a scalar function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and addition of another function \\\\( w(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( u_y(z) \\\\) of the modified function \\\\( y(t) = h(t)x(t) \\\\), can the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the modifying function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) results in complexities in the transformed domain that make it impossible to uniquely invert the transform to recover \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without additional information. The Laplace domain does not preserve individual identity of multiplicative modifications in a manner that allows unique inversion.",
