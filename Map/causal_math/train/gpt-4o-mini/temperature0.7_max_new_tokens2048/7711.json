  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing system where a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) modulates an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) according to the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\). \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then analyzed at various time points t using a Fourier transform.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a high-pass filter is applied as an intervention, will the resultant spectrum \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) for times \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a high-pass filter modifies the frequency components of the signal, but the overall spectrum \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) still depends on the initial modulation by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) because the convolution effects are still embedded in the signal prior to the filtering. Thus, the resultant spectrum remains dependent on both the original modulation by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the intervention.",
