  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\). This differential equation describes a rotation in the complex plane. The function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-kt}z \\\\) (where k is the same real constant) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on i and not on k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{-kt}z \\\\) counteracts the initial transformation, potentially nullifying it. The effect at time T therefore still depends on the values of k applied initially and during the intervention, affecting both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time variable t influences the complex function z(t), which in turn leads to its derivative z'(t). The derivative z'(t) affects the transformation function f(z), while the constant k influences both f(z) and the transformation g(z). Ultimately, the transformation g(z) impacts the endpoint z(T), which is also influenced by the imaginary unit i.",
