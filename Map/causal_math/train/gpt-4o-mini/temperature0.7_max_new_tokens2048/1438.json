  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and z is a complex-valued function of time t. Investigate the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is another real constant, on the evolution of z.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) scales the initial condition, without knowing whether or not the transformation was applied, it is impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The absence or presence of the transformation fundamentally changes the initial condition.",
