  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The function maps to the transformation with integral transformation operator \\\\( T \\) defined as \\\\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = x / (s - i\\omega) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without additional interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are directly identifiable from the form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), since the inverse Laplace transform operation would yield \\\\( z(t) = x e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) uniquely recovering the original function parameters.",
