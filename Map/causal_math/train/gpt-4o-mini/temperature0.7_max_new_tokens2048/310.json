  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex number. Analyze the mappings when transformed by this exponential function in the complex plane, considering different paths in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( \\\\int_{C} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), can we definitively determine the original path C in the complex plane without knowing the function form?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the function form and how it interacts with the contour, various paths might yield the same integral value, especially when considering how complex exponential functions can behave over different contours.",
