  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} z(0) \\\\), where A is a constant real number representing the angular frequency. This transformation is an example of a complex rotation in the time domain.\n\nCan we definitively discern whether an intervention occurred and what the values of A and B were by only analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it's challenging to uniquely backtrack to confirm whether an intervention occurred and to determine the exact values of A and B without additional information. The outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various scenarios involving different values of A and B, as well as different intervention timings due to the non-uniqueness of the solutions in the complex plane rotations.",
