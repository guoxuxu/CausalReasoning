  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( x \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a real number representing a rotational frequency in the complex plane. The behavior over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real number.\n\nHaving observed the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial position \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to unambiguously recover the initial condition \\\\( x \\\\) as the phase shift introduced by \\\\( B \\\\) could have significantly altered the initial angle or point in the complex plane.",
