  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a transformation on a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex number. The transformation is defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant and t is time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an additional phase shift, causing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to depend on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The multiplicative effect of the complex exponentials alters both the magnitude and phase of the trajectory.",
