  "Problem": "Consider a system involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions governed by linear differential equations, and i represents the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is a real constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to develop under the respective differential equations for x and y without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved under the original equations to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) rotates the initial complex plane vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\), changing its trajectory. Since \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) effectively rotates by an angle \\\\( Bt \\\\), the resulting trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will be different from the untransformed path.",
