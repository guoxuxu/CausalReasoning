  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a linear transformation on a complex function. Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, representing a unit circle in the complex plane. The transformation given is \\\\( T(z) = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The magnitude of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be a result of various combinations of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\) under the condition that their product results in the same scaling effect. The rotational component governed by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) remains consistently predictable, but the scaling due to interventions cannot be uniquely determined from the endpoint alone.",
