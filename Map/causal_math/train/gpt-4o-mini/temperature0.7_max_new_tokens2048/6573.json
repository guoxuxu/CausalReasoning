  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is defined as the Laplace transform. We examine the effects this transformation has on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to convert it into the frequency domain, does the action of transforming back from the frequency domain to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transform without any other intervention result in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are designed to be inverse operations. Applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse, provided all conditions for the transforms are met and there is no other intervention, should indeed return the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
