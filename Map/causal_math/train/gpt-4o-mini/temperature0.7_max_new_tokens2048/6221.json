  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants in complex form. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace transform and its inverse on function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), interpreted over varying scenarios.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) is calculated and then reverted via the inverse Laplace transform without any manipulation of the transformation, does the resultant function maintain its original form \\\\( u(t) + iv(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are exact inverses under typical conditions where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) do not introduce discontinuities or non-linearities. Thus, the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is perfectly reconstructed, maintaining the structure of \\\\( u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) over time.",
