  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) over a rod of length L is described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) to the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\).\n\nIf an intervention alters the system by applying a heat source varying over time, described by the function \\( g(x, t) \\), after applying the Fourier transform to \\( T(x, 0) \\), will the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) at time \\( t \\) depend only on the heat equation without considering the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the variable heat source \\( g(x, t) \\) modifies the system dynamics, leading \\( T(x, t) \\) to depend on both the heat equation and the characteristics of \\( g(x, t) \\). The Fourier transform's initial application does not nullify effects of the dynamic intervention.",
