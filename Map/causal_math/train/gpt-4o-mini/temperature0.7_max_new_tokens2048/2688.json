  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact through a Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\( F(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real-valued angular frequency, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time.\n\nIf we observe the modified Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) after an unknown intervention, can we ascertain whether the damping intervention \\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) might suggest damping, without prior knowledge about the application of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), we cannot conclusively attribute alterations in \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Similar effects could arise from other types of interventions affecting amplitude and phase.",
