  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real scalar constant, representing angular frequency in the complex plane. Study the effects of applying an integral transform \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i\\\\omega \\\\), a complex constant.\n\nGiven the output of the transform after intervening by multiplying with \\\\( w(t) = e^{iCt} \\\\), can we precisely isolate the effect of the intervention and calculate \\\\( A \\\\) without knowing \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the intervention details are unknown, specifically the value of \\\\( C \\\\), isolating \\\\( A \\\\) from the modified output \\\\( T[u] = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(A + C)} \\\\) is not feasible as the transform's result blends the effects of both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). Without distinguishing their individual contributions, precise determination of \\\\( A \\\\) alone from the final result is impossible.",
