  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the impact of altering this system using a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\(x_0\\\\) directly under \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\) alters the initial state to \\\\(Sx_0\\\\). The evolved state at t = T will be \\\\(e^{Dt}(Sx_0)\\\\), which generally differs from \\\\(e^{Dt}x_0\\\\) unless \\\\(S\\\\) commutes with \\\\(e^{Dt}\\\\).",
