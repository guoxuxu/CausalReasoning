  "Problem": "Examine the causality in a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are considering the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, without knowledge about whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied, the differential progress and modification through the operator L might leave several possible initial states that could lead to the observed \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), especially if effects of L are dissipative or dispersive.",
