  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We explore different causal influences on the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its inverse transformations under varying conditions.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number) at t = 0 and is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) \\\\), does \\\\( f(z) \\\\) only depend on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) results in \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). This transformation absolutely depends on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\). The result distinctly represents the influence of \\\\( a \\\\) on the transform without external factors influencing the system after t = 0.",
