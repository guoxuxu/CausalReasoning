  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and the integral transformation is the Laplace Transform. We study the effect of a linear differential operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}g = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dt^2} - 2\\\\frac{dg}{dt} + g \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and then its Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is computed, will the transformed function match the Laplace Transform of the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without the operator applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of the operator-applied function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}g \\\\) results in a different representation in the s-domain. Specifically, applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) modifies the terms that involve s, resulting in \\\\( G(s) = s^2G(s) - s*g(0) - g'(0) - 2sG(s) + 2g(0) + G(s) \\\\), differing from the original transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
