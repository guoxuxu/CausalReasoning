  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation using the matrix \\\\( L \\\\), which operates in the complex function space by multiplying with the matrix \\\\( e^{i\\omega} \\\\), an operator associated with frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\. The system is analyzed for function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and later evaluation at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) without any other intervention result in the same output as if the transformation was not applied at all?",
  "Explanation": "When applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), the function is fundamentally altered to \\\\( e^{i\\omega}e^{\\lambda z} = e^{(\\lambda + i\\omega)z} \\\\. The result depends on the values of \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), demonstrating that the frequency modulation changes the system's behavior.",
