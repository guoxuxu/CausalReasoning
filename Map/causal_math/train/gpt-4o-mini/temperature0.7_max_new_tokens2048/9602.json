  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a partial differential equation shown by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analyze the scenario where a transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is performed, with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) representing the Fourier transform.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\), it is impossible to ascertain whether the observed \\\\( u(T) \\\\) resulted directly from evolution under L or from modified conditions due to the Fourier transformation. Different initial conditions can yield the same result under different operational conditions.",
