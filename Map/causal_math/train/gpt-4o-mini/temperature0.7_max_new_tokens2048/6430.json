  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex vector. The function is subject to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[w(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}w(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied directly or after some evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information on the application timeline of \\\\( T[w(t)] \\\\), it is impossible to ascertain the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) merely from the transformed outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) due to the integral transformation's potential alteration of the vector's trajectory.",
