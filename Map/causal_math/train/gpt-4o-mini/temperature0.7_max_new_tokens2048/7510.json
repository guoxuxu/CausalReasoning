  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a function \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\) on a complex variable \\( z \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\), where \\( k \\) is a complex constant, and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( h(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of whether \\( h(z) \\) was applied (involving the specific value of \\( \\omega \\)), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( z_0 \\). The transformation \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\) could have altered \\( z_0 \\) in such a way that any reconstructed \\( z_0 \\) from \\( z(T) \\) might represent multiple potential initial conditions.",
