  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}\\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a function of real variable t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf a manipulation modifies \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+C)t} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_0 > 0 \\\\), where C is another complex constant, will the Laplace transform of the modified \\\\(z(t)\\\\), \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\), still depend solely on A?",
  "Explanation": "The modification introduces a new parameter C, which changes the function to \\\\( e^{(A+C)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of the new function will be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(A+C)} \\\\), making it dependent on both A and C.",
