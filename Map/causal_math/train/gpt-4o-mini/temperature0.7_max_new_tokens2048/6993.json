  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) that transforms a function \\( u(x) \\) using a convolution integral \\( L[u](x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x - t)u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( k \\) is the kernel function. We scrutinize the effects of an initial function \\( u_0(x) \\) and its interaction with different kernels, including potential changes in kernel midway.\n\nIf \\( u_0(x) \\) is initially subjected to the kernel \\( k_1(x) \\), and then allowed to evolve without further alteration, will \\( L[u_0](x) \\) at time T still reflect only the influence of \\( k_1(x) \\) without any other kernel's involvement?",
  "Explanation": "Once \\( u_0(x) \\) is transformed by \\( k_1(x) \\), the resultant function \\( L[u_0](x) \\) will encapsulate the effects of \\( k_1 \\) exclusively, as there is no subsequent kernel interaction involved to alter or modify this outcome.",
