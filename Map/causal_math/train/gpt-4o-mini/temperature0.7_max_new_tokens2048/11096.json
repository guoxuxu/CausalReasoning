  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a linear time-invariant system where the complex impedance (Z) of the circuit is formulated as \\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} \\), and s is the Laplace transform variable. We explore the effects of adding a parallel capacitor with impedance \\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\) to this system.\n\nGiven the final impedance observed, can we determine whether a resistor, a capacitor, or both were added at time \\( t_1 \\) after initially modifying \\( Z(s) \\) and knowing only the final form of \\( Z(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed impedance could result from various combinations of additional elements (capacitors, resistors) which may have similar effects on the impedance. Thus, without more information, it is not possible to distinguish precisely which components were added at \\( t_1 \\).",
