  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) to this function and its inverse scenarios.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real part positive complex number, and then the function is allowed to evolve in the transform domain without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) for \\\\( s > a \\\\) give the original function upon applying the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), given \\\\( a \\\\) with a positive real part, is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), and applying the inverse Laplace transform correctly recovers the original function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\). There is no modification in between the transformations, hence the procedure reverses itself perfectly under ideal conditions.",
