  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix representing mechanical dynamics. Additionally, consider a transformation applied to the state described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}\\\\)z, where D is another constant matrix and t represents time.\n\nGiven an observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has evolved to time T, can we definitively trace back to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or the initial condition, it's impossible to ascertain if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulted from a transformed or untransformed initial state due to the exponential transformation potentially changing initial conditions.",
