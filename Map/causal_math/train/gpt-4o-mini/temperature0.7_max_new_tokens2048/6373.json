  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transform with a kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze its effect over time t.\n\nIf the integral transform is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve through time, will the transformed function at a later time T still exhibit the same periodic properties as \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform alters the function by convolving it with \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\), which affects the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The nature of the exponential decay in the kernel can significantly dampen or alter the frequency components, resulting in a transformation that does not preserve the periodic properties of the original function over time.",
