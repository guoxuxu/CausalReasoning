  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of an external force applied to a mechanical system obeying the second order differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The system is subject to an impulse response represented as a transformation \\\\(g(x) = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are matrices and u denotes the control input.\n\nWith knowledge of the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) and given that interventions occurred, is it possible to accurately backtrack to identify the specific transformations (whether \\\\(g(x)\\\\), \\\\(h(x)\\\\), or both) used?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and control inputs (A, B, D, E, u) could lead to the same final state due to the complexity of their possible interactions and effects. This introduces ambiguity in identifying specific interventions based solely on the final observed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An external force causes the system to respond, which in turn affects the final state x(T). The control input influences the transformation g(x), which also affects the system's response. The constants p and q determine the overall behavior of the system, while the impulse response is a consequence of the system's response.",
