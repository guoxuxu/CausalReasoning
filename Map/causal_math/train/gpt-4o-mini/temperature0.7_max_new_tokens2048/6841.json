  "Problem": "We consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) where \\( t \\) is time and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. Using an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform, we wish to analyze how modifications to the original function impact its behavior over time.\n\nIf the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is calculated and then the transformed back, will the resulting function \\( z'(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) be the same as the original \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operator that can be perfectly inverted under certain conditions, returning the original function where the region of convergence includes the imaginary axis, as it applies in this scenario for \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\). Hence, the inverse Laplace transform yields the original function, \\( z'(t) = z(t) \\).",
