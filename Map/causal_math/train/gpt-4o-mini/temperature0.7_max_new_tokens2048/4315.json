  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and A, B, C, D are constants. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](s) \\\\) and its inverse on the dynamics of this system.\n\nIf a modulation by a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is introduced as an intervention during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will this affect the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), independent of whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the modulation function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) directly impacts the phase and frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) throughout its evolution. This modulation affects the final state by adding a frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to the system, irrespective of whether the initial state was Fourier transformed.",
