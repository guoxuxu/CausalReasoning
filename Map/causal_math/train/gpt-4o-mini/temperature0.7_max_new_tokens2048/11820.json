  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear time-invariant system characterized by an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The output of the system \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is given by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\\\). We then apply a Fourier transform to \\\\( y(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Y(f) \\\\).\n\nIf the signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without any modification to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the output, \\\\( Y(f) \\\\), be the product of the Fourier transforms of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( Y(f) = X(f)H(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the pointwise product of their Fourier transforms. Therefore, \\\\( Y(f) = X(f)H(f) \\\\) is valid, confirming that the cause (input signal and system response) directly results in the effect (spectral domain representation of the output).",
