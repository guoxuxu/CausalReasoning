  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\(\\int_0^t K(t-u) x(u) du = y(t)\\), where \\(K(s)\\) is a complex kernel function and \\(x(t)\\) is the input function. We study the changes in the output \\( y(t) \\) under the transformations initiated by different input functions such as \\( g(x) = x + Ae^{-\\lambda t} \\) for some constant matrix \\( A \\) and scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) is applied to a function \\( x_0(t) \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the integral equation without further intervention, will \\( y(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0(t) \\) was directly evolved to t = T under the integral equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(x) \\) modifies the initial input \\( x_0(t) \\) by adding a decaying exponential term, affecting the integral equation's convolution with the kernel \\( K(s) \\). This change alters the resulting output \\( y(t) \\) at any time T.",
