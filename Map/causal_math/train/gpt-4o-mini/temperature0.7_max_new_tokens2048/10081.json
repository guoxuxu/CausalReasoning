  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\), where L is inductance, R is resistance and E(t) represents a time-dependent electromotive force. Further, suppose that an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by multiplying the current amplitude by a scalar \\\\( k \\\\) is applied, and we explore how this affects the response of the system over time t.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T(I) = kI \\\\) is applied to the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to starting with \\\\( I_0 \\\\) and evolving directly to t = T under \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(I) = kI \\\\) changes the initial condition of the system. The solution to the differential equation depends on the initial current, so an initial multiplication by \\\\( k \\\\) scales all subsequent currents by the same factor, affecting the overall system response compared with direct evolution from \\\\( I_0 \\\\).",
