  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = Y(s)\\\\), where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is the original time function. To examine any causal changes, an impulse response function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is convolved with \\\\(y(t)\\\\) resulting in a new function \\\\(g(t) = h(t) * y(t)\\\\). The frequency responses of \\\\(h\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are denoted by \\\\(H(s)\\\\) and \\\\(Y(s)\\\\), respectively.\n\nIf during the system's function another impulse response function \\\\(k(t)\\\\) is applied at a time \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), influencing the ongoing convolution, will \\\\(G(s)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t = T > t_1\\\\) still purely represent the product \\\\(H(s)Y(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new impulse response \\\\(k(t)\\\\) alters the system dynamics post \\\\(t_1\\\\), introducing an additional convolution factor. The Laplace transform \\\\(G(s)\\\\) will now include the influence of \\\\(K(s)\\\\), the transform of \\\\(k(t)\\\\), making it represent a different product, not just \\\\(H(s)Y(s)\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The original time function y(t) influences g(t) through convolution with the impulse response function h(t). The impulse response function h(t) also contributes to g(t). The Laplace transforms Y(s) and H(s) together produce G(s), which represents the combined effects of y(t) and h(t). The additional impulse response function k(t) affects g(t) and subsequently G(s), indicating that G(s) may not only represent the product of H(s) and Y(s) after k(t) is applied.",
