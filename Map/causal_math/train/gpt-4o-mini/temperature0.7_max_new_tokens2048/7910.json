  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) and n is a non-negative integer. Let's explore how the convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) affects the outcomes, where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine uniquely whether it originated from the convolution of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without any specific initial detail about \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\), especially their specific forms or parameters, determining the exact precursor functions for \\\\( H(s) \\\\) becomes mathematically infeasible. There could be multiple pairs whose convolution could result in the same \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
