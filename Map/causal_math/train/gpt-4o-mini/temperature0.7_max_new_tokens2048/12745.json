  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, defined by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T(u)(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\) used in the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) cannot be precisely determined from \\\\( T(u)(t) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\), as \\\\( s \\\\) influences the modes and weights captured by the integral transformation, affecting the inverse operation's accuracy and specificity.",
