  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. For analysis, we apply a Fourier transform to change the domain from time to frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\), which converts the time-domain function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) into its frequency-domain counterpart.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to an initial function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without further manipulation, will the original differential equation still describe the behavior in the frequency domain without adjustments?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the domain and representation of the differential equation. In the frequency domain the equation transforms into \\\\(-\\\\omega^2 F_x(\\\\omega) + \\\\omega^2 F_x(\\\\omega) = 0\\\\), thus preserving the form but in a different mathematical framework. However, transforming back to the time domain is necessary to retrieve the original functional form.",
