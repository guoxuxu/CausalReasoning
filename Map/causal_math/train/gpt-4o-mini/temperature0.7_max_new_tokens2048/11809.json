  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Analyze the response of the function under an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) after applying the transformation to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), can we deduce the exact nature of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) across the entire interval from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation provides a mixed representation of the original function across the interval and obscures individual characteristics at specific points since integrals, especially under exponential multipliers, typically blend function values across the entire interval.",
