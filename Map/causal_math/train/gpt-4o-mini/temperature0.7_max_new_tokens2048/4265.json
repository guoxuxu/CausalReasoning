  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and output function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a system governed by the convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specified as \\\\( y(t) = x(t) \\\\ast h(t) \\\\). Consider two functions, \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h_2(t) = t \\\\ast h_1(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is applied to a system with impulse response \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and then the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is processed through a system with impulse response \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), will the overall output be the same as applying \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The overall output when first using \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) then \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\) represents a doubly convolved system, akin to \\\\( x(t) \\\\ast (h_1(t) \\\\ast t) \\\\), which is different from directly using \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), due to the additional convolution with \\\\( t \\\\) that modifies the signal.",
