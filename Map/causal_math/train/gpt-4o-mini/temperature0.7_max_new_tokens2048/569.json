  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow through a variable area duct governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} = -a(x)Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) represents the flow rate and \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a variable coefficient dependent on the position \\\\( x \\\\). We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(Q) = e^{Bx}Q \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(Q) \\\\) is applied to a flow rate \\\\( Q_0 \\\\) at x = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} = -a(x)Q \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( Q(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( Q_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to x = X under \\\\( \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} = -a(x)Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(Q) \\\\) modifies the initial flow rate, changing the starting conditions of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Bx} \\\\) affects the magnitude of \\\\( Q(x) \\\\) initially, the evolution under the differential equation will take a different trajectory compared to the unmodified initial condition.",
