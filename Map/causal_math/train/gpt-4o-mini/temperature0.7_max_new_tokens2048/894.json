  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t)\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We also introduce a transformation \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) where S is the matrix that diagonalizes D, and K is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) precisely at t = 0 without knowledge if the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, and the exact form of K, the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely reversed from \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The transformation may put the system onto a completely different trajectory, making it non-trivial to extract the initial conditions.",
