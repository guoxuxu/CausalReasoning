  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\\\), where a is a constant. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to this equation over space and assessing its implication under different integration transformations.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine whether an intervention like \\\\( u(x, t_1) = u(x, t_1) + h(x) \\\\) was applied at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), merely by knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) during the intervention can create changes that may not be uniquely determined by observing just the end state at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). In the Fourier domain, determining the exact interference of \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(k) \\\\) based on \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) alone is complex due to potential overlaps and ambiguities in resulting frequency components.",
