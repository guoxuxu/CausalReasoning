  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nIf at some \\(t_1\\), an operation such as another Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, will \\(z(T)\\) at \\(T > t_1\\) uniquely reflect the properties and rules of the original matrix \\(C\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another Fourier transform modulates the system differently, adding another layer of transformation. This makes the final state \\(z(T)\\) a combination influenced by \\(C\\), the original \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\), and the second Fourier transform. Thus, \\(z(T)\\) depends collectively on multiple factors, not just \\(C\\).",
