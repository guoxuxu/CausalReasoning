  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function describing displacement and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. The Laplace transform is used to study how system characteristics change when subject to different conditions or transformations.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u'(t) = u(t) + v(t) \\\\), where \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is another function, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be influenced only by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and not by \\\\( v(t) \\\\) or \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( v(t) \\\\) adds a new variable, affecting the total displacement. Both the modification in the displacement function and the angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) will influence the Laplace transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), revealing effects not solely reliant on the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(t) causes z(t), which in turn causes its Laplace transform. The modification of u(t) to u'(t) through the addition of v(t) influences z'(t), and thus the Laplace transform of z'(t) is influenced by u'(t), which includes the effect of v(t). The variable omega influences both z(t) and z'(t), and the time t1 marks when the modification occurs, affecting the evaluation of the Laplace transform at T greater than t1.",
