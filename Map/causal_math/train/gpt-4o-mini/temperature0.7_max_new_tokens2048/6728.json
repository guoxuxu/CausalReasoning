  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( z \\\\) a complex number. A Fourier transform transformation \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the transformed function, making it \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We will explore the implications of modifying the power \\\\( n \\\\) and the transformation's effect on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the form of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine if a scaling by \\\\( a \\\\) was applied or if the change was entirely due to modification of \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform's outcome does not allow us to distinctly attribute changes to either scaling by \\\\( a \\\\) or modification of \\\\( n \\\\) unless more information about the spread or amplitude influence is available. The transformation masks the specific causes behind changes in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
