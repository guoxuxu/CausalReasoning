  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is used. We explore the properties as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoes transformations along the real and imaginary axes respectively in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + bi \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers.\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a transformed point \\\\( z' = h(z_0) \\\\), can one deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unambiguously?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-invertibility and non-linearity in the transformation and exponential function, multiple different complex numbers could yield the same output under \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Without exact information about the transformation parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed output.",
