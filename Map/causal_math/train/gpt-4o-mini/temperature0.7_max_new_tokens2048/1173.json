  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), will the transformed state at time t be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without applying the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the resulting function by integrating the modified exponential terms. The outcome, \\\\( \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} e^{iA\\\\tau}z_0 d\\\\tau \\\\), is fundamentally different from the original exponential growth rule, as it includes the effects of both A and B.",
