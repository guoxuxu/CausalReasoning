  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system with a controlled function \\\\(F(x, u) = A x + B u\\\\), where x is the state vector, u is the control input, A is the state matrix, and B is the control matrix. We are interested in the impact of a perturbation transformation \\\\(h(x) = Cx\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on the evolution of the state vector over time under the control strategy that minimizes a quadratic cost function.\n\nIf an additional control strategy adjustment using a feedback matrix \\\\( K \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be solely dependent on the original system matrices A and B, irrespective of the perturbation matrix \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention of applying the feedback matrix \\\\( K \\\\) affects the trajectory and final state depending on its interaction with all previous state transformations, including the perturbation by \\\\( C \\\\). The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on all these matrices.",
