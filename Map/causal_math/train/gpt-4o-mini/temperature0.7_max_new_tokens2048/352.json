  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\) on the real function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) when transformed using the Laplace Transform. Let the original system be governed by \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the resultant function at time T, can we accurately determine which transformations (either \\\\( z(s) \\\\), \\\\( w(s) \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The ultimate Laplace Transform could arise from various combinations of applying \\\\( z(s) \\\\), \\\\( w(s) \\\\), or both. Due to the complexities introduced by these modifications (not simple inverses or cancellations), it isn't feasible to precisely trace back to the specific transformations applied.",
