  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( F(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( F(z) \\), and considering the influence of \\( \\lambda \\) on the evolution, it is not feasible to retrieve \\( z_0 \\) uniquely; the observed \\( z(t) \\) could result from various initial conditions altered by different \\( \\lambda \\) values.",
