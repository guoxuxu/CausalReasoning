  "Problem": "Imagine a physical system that can be modeled by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a region. Consider interventions performed using a boundary condition modification where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) on part of the boundary is altered using a function \\\\(h(t, x)\\\\), which is timedependent.\n\nCan we ascertain which specific modifications (interventions on boundary conditions) were implemented by observing the final state \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) at some \\\\(t > t_1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) could potentially result from numerous similar yet distinct intervention profiles because of the linear nature and boundary condition sensitivity of the Laplace equation. Multiple boundary condition scenarios could lead to the same or indistinguishably close results in the solution domain.",
