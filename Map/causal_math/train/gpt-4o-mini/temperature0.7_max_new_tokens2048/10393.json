  "Problem": "Consider a discrete-time system governed by the equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\\\), where \\\\( f(x) = A x \\\\) with A being a square matrix. We also use a linear operator \\\\( T(x) = B x \\\\), where B is another square matrix, to transform the initial state.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( T(x) \\\\) to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and subsequently let the system evolve according to \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x_N \\\\) at time step N be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to step N under the same system equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( B x_0 \\\\). The new trajectory starting from \\\\( B x_0 \\\\) is evolved by repeated applications of A, resulting in \\\\( A^N B x_0 \\\\). This differs from \\\\( A^N x_0 \\\\) unless A and B commute.",
