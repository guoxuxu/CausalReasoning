  "Problem": "Consider a thermodynamic system where the temperature \\( T \\) inside a reactor is controlled by a function \\( u(t, T) = kT + c \\), where \\( k \\) and \\( c \\) are constants. Here, \\( k \\) represents a proportional control on the temperature, and \\( c \\) is a constant heating term. We explore scenarios applying a linear transformation function \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants, altering \\( T \\) at various instants.\n\nIf \\( v(T) \\) is applied to the reactor temperature \\( T_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( T \\) is allowed to evolve under \\( u(t, T) \\) without further intervention, will the temperature \\( T(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( T_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( u(t, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) modifies the baseline temperature \\( T_0 \\) to \\( mT_0 + n \\), which changes the initial conditions for the control function \\( u(t, T) \\). The proportional and constant terms in \\( u(t, T) \\) will therefore start from and act on this altered initial temperature, leading to a different temperature profile over time.",
