  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then its Fourier transform is taken, will the resulting spectrum be the same as if \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was transformed without multiplication by \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by the Gaussian \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the signal by damping it before the transform. This damping changes the frequency components leading to a different spectrum. The Gaussian acts as a frequency filter, emphasizing some components while suppressing others.",
