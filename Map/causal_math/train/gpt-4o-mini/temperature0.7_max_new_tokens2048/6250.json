  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The domain boundary \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\) has been split into two parts, where on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_1\\\\) the function \\\\(u\\\\) is held fixed at zero, and on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\), a non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is applied involving the function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial n} = h(x)\\\\). We examine the effect of modifying the Neumann boundary condition by a function \\\\(g(x,t)\\\\) which depends on position and time.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(u(x)\\\\) within \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), can we determine uniquely whether the boundary condition was altered to \\\\(h(x) = kx\\\\) on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in \\\\(h(x)\\\\) affect \\\\(u(x)\\\\), inversely determining \\\\(h(x)\\\\) from \\\\(u(x)\\\\) is non-trivial and generally not unique without additional information. The boundary data and domain shape influence the solvability of this inverse problem.",
