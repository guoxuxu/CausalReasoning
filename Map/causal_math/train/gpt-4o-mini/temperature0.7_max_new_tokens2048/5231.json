  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) representing a complex valued function, where \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), and \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real valued functions governed by the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = A u \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = B v \\). We further study the transformation by the integral operator \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{C s} z(s) ds \\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a new operator \\( \\mathcal{S}(z) = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{D s} z(s) ds \\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting function \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), disregarding \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention introduces another modifying layer represented by \\( e^{D s} \\), making the end state \\( z(T) \\) dependent on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), in addition to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). The superposition of integral transformations significantly impacts the resultant state at \\( T \\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(t) is governed by its derivative, which is directly influenced by the parameter A, while v(t) is governed by its derivative, influenced by the parameter B. The transformation of the function z(t) through the integral operator T depends on the constant matrix C and the function z(t). The application of the operator S at time t1 leads to a transformation of z(t) that also depends on the constant matrix D. Therefore, the resulting function z(T) is influenced by both A and B as well as the transformations applied through C and D.",
