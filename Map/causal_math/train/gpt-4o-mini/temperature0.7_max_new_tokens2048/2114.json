  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a vector differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\), where K is a matrix diagonalizing D (i.e., \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\)), and L is a diagonal matrix, is applied to observe its behavior under system evolution.\n\nUpon observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 before \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was potentially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the known properties of D and its association with L through K, it is possible to reverse the transformation and the natural evolution of the system to compute back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), assuming \\\\( z(T) = K^{-1}e^{LT}K z_0 \\\\), implying \\\\( z_0 = K e^{-LT} K^{-1} z(T) \\\\).",
