  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Hx\\\\), where H is a constant matrix. The effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix, is investigated.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Sx \\\\) (where S is a scalar matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on H?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( f(x) \\\\), modifies the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( Sx(t_1) \\\\) and the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will be affected by the matrix S in addition to H. Since \\\\( e^{H(T-t_1)}Sx(t_1) \\\\) reflects this combined impact, the behavior of the system is inherently connected to both S and H.",
