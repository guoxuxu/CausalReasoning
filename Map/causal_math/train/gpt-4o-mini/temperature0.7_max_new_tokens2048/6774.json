  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + q(x)y = \\\\lambda y \\\\), with boundary conditions \\\\( y(0) = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(1) = 0 \\\\). Here, \\\\( q(x) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how transformations \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) (where k is a constant multiplier) affect the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this system.\n\nObserving an eigenfunction \\\\( y(x) \\\\) of the system, is it possible to determine if a transformation \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) was applied to obtain it from another eigenfunction?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiplying an eigenfunction by a non-zero scalar results in another valid eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue, it is not possible to uniquely determine whether the observed function was scaled from another unless additional information about the scale factor k is given.",
