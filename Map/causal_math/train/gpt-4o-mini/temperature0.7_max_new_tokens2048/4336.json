  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this function.\n\nKnowing the transformed signal \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and observing a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\), can we determine if the intervention (frequency shift by \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\)) was indeed applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the original signal characteristics and observing a shift in the Fourier transform's peak from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\), it implies that the signal was subjected to a frequency shift by \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\). This understanding relies on the known behavior of Fourier transforms under frequency shifting, allowing accurate inference about the intervention.",
