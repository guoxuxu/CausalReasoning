  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. To analyze causal inferences, we introduce an integral transform \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the integral transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) influenced its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the impact of Q, the integral transform, it's challenging to reverse-engineer the system accurately to its initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The influence of Q during the transformation process masks the pristine effect caused solely by P.",
