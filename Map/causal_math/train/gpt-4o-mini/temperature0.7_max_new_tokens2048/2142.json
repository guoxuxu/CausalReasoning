  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where initial data points are mapped in a complex plane according to the function \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( i \\\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant, and \\\\\\( t \\\\\\) is time. We examine the effect of another transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\\\) introduced as an intervention, where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the magnitude of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( t = T \\\\\\), can we infer the exact initial value \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) purely based on this magnitude, assuming no intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "While the magnitude of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) provides information about the magnitude of \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\), it does not offer any clues about its phase. Without the phase information, the exact value of \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) in the complex plane cannot be uniquely determined just from its magnitude.",
