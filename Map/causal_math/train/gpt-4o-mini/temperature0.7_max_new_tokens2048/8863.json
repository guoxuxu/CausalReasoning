  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega 't} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is different from \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the integral \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T reflect only the effects of the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in frequency from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at the time of intervention, thus impacting the outcome of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The resulting integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T will incorporate effects due to both the original segment (0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) under frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the intervened segment (\\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T) under \\\\( \\omega' \\\\).",
