  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. Consider the Laplace transform definition \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) = e^{(a+c)t} \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\) in its evolution under \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, will the new transformed function \\\\( \\\\tilde{F}(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = b \\\\) now solely depend on \\\\( a \\\\) and not on \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to \\\\( e^{(a+c)t} \\\\), and thus its Laplace transform becomes \\\\( \\\\tilde{F}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - (a+c)} \\\\). This transformed function now depends on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\). The transformation effect is thus altered by \\\\( c \\\\), indicating dependency not just on \\\\( a \\\\) but on the intervention constant \\\\( c \\\\) as well.",
