  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the variable s.\n\nIf the peak amplitude of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is altered but the position remains the same, can it be determined whether the original time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was scaled, solely from this observation?",
  "Explanation": "The unchanged peak position in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) confirms that the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remains constant. However, a change in amplitude alone in the Fourier domain cannot conclusively determine whether the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was scaled or if the transformation itself was adjusted (e.g., scaling in the Fourier domain directly). This ambiguity arises because multiple causal pathways might result in the same observed effect in amplitude alterations.",
