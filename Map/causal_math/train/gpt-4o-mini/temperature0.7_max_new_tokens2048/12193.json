  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) is the temperature distribution over a domain. We investigate the effect of introducing a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) applied from time t = 0, described mathematically as \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without extra information about the base conditions or the exact characteristics of \\\\( S(x) \\\\), it is challenging to distinguish if the observed temperature distribution at \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) arose purely due to diffusion or due to the influence of \\\\( S(x) \\\\). The presence of natural fluctuations and boundary effects in \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) complicates deducing the presence of the source term from the final state alone.",
