  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We assess the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function, given by the integral \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iwx} e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), analyzing both the direct transformation and its inversion.\n\nIf an additional phase-shift operation \\\\( h(x) = e^{iqx} \\\\) where \\\\( q \\\\) is real, is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) before the Fourier transform, will the result still be a delta function at \\\\( k = w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the phase shift changes the function to \\\\( z(x)h(x) = e^{i(w+q)x} \\\\). The resultant Fourier transform will be \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - (w + q)) \\\\), thus shifting the delta function to be centered at \\\\( k = w + q \\\\), not \\\\( k = w \\\\).",
