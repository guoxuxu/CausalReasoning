  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered over time t, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nBy observing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately back-calculate to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the magnitude could have been scaled initially by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\). The observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result from various scaled versions of potential initial conditions.",
