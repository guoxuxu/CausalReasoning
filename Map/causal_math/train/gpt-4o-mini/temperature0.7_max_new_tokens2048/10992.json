  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) - By(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y}(t) = Bx(t) + Ay(t) \\\\), with A and B being constants. Let's examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely identify what transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used on the system, based solely on the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in effects from different transformations, particularly when dealing with complex exponential scaling factors which impact both amplitude and phase, makes it challenging to disentangle the specific transformations used to arrive at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple potential paths could lead to the same outcome, rendering exact inference of interventions based only on final state impossible.",
