  "Problem": "In the context of continuous-time Markov chains, consider the transition rate matrix Q for a two-state system where state 0 can transition to state 1 and vice versa. Let \\\\(\\\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\\\) be the state-transition matrix used to solve for the probabilities of state occurrences over time t.\n\nIf an intervention at time t = t1 modifies the transition rates in Q to a new transition rate matrix \\\\(Q'\\\\), will the state probabilities at t = T > t1 be solely determined by the new matrix \\\\(Q'\\\\) and not the initial matrix Q?",
  "Explanation": "The state probabilities at t = T will be influenced both by the original rate matrix Q up to t1 and by the new rate matrix \\\\(Q'\\\\) from t1 to T. The transition dynamics before t1 will affect the intermediate probabilities, which in turn influence how Q' acts subsequently.",
