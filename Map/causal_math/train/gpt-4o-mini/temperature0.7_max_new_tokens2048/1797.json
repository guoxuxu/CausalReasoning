  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\), where V is the electric potential. A transformation under a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) (with \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) representing spatial variables) is applied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to modify the potential V at a boundary at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will the potential V at any other point change as a direct result of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the boundary conditions, thereby altering the solutions to the Laplace equation. Since the potential V in the region influenced by these boundary conditions is determined by these new conditions, the potential V at any point is altered by this transformation.",
