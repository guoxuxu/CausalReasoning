  "Problem": "Examine a convolution integral system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} x(\\\\tau) h(t-\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response, a known function. Changes are made to the input signal via transformation \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\), with a being a constant.\n\nCan we accurately establish which transformations (\\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) were applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at different points, solely by analyzing the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations involving \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) can lead to the same output at time T, especially considering the variable behavior of the impulse response function. This plurality in possible inputs and their effects makes it impossible to certainly identify which transformations were applied.",
