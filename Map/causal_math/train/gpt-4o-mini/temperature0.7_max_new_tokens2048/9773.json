  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system that filters an input signal x(t) using a transfer function H(s). We examine how impulse response h(t), which is the inverse Laplace Transform of H(s), affects the output y(t) of the system.\n\nIf an input signal x_0(t) is provided at t = 0, and the system is left to operate with its intrinsic transfer function H(s) without further modification, will the output y(t) at t = T be solely determined by the impulse response h(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The output y(t) is the convolution of the input x_0(t) with the impulse response h(t), representing the system's reaction to the input under the influence of H(s). Hence, without any intervention, the output at t = T is determined by the impulse response applied to the input.",
