  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a series of transformations including a Fourier Transform followed by a linear filter represented by a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then an inverse Fourier Transform.\n\nIf an additional non-linear distortion \\\\( D(t) \\\\) is applied to the signal after the inverse Fourier Transform, will the final output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) still be fully characterized by the linear filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the non-linear distortion \\\\( D(t) \\\\) significantly alters the final output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), meaning it cannot be characterized solely by the linear properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The non-linearity introduced by \\\\( D(t) \\\\) adds additional effects that are not represented by the linear transformation alone.",

Finally, a non-linear distortion D(t) is applied to z(t), affecting the final output signal.",
