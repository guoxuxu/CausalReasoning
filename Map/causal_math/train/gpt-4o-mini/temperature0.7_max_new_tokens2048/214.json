  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing the state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied prevents accurate back-calculation of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could have altered the initial state in such a way that multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed outcome at T, particularly if the real and imaginary parts (A and B) do not commute with C.",
