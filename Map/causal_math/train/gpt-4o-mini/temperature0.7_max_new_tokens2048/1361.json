  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a change in the variable s defined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(t) = t^ke^{At} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and A is a non-zero constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( f(t) = t^k e^{(A+s)t} \\\\) at t = 0 and then transformed using \\\\( I(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( I(s) \\\\) solely depend on s, without being influenced by the change in k?",
  "Explanation": "Initial modification in function from \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{(A+s)t} \\\\) directly increases the decay rate in the exponent affecting the convergence of the integral. The change in k also affects the growth rate of t terms, thereby impacting both the convergence of the integral and the final form of \\\\( I(s) \\\\).",
