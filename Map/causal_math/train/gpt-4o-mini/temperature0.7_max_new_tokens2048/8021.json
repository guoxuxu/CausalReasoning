  "Problem": "Consider a complex system defined by the equation \\( z' = Cz \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex function and C is a constant complex matrix. The system transformation is analyzed through the lens of the integral transform \\( L(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{Mt}z(t)dt \\) across time interval [0, T], where M is a constant complex matrix and T is the endpoint of the considered interval.\n\nIf \\( L(z) \\) is computed for a function \\( z_0 \\) starting at t = 0 and evolves under \\( z' = Cz \\) without further intervention, will \\( L(z)(T) \\) reflect strictly the influence of C without any alteration due to M over the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( L(z) \\) incorporates \\( e^{Mt} \\), inherently altering each instant during the interval by this exponential factor. Consequently, \\( L(z)(T) \\) is not only a reflection of how C affects \\( z \\) but also how M influences the accumulation of \\( z \\) over the interval, altering the final computed transform.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the function z is directly influenced by the constant complex matrix C, which governs the relationship z' = Cz. The calculation of L(z) depends on the function z, indicating that L(z) reflects the influence of z over the interval. However, the constant matrix M also plays a role in the integral transform L(z), suggesting that L(z) is influenced by both z and M.",
