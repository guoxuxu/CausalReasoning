  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output state z depends on the input state x through the transformation given by z = Sx, where S is a complex transformation matrix. We consider the influence of multiplying complex eigenvalues in the matrix S analyzed over variable changes.\n\nConsidering the output z after interventions (multiplying S by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and adding K), can we precisely determine the sequence or types of interventions applied by only observing the final output z?",
  "Explanation": "The output z could potentially be achieved through various combinations of scaling and matrix addition or different sequences thereof. Without further information about the interventions, the effects are not distinguishable solely based on the output, thus reinforcing the non-unique resolution of the transformation procedures.",
