  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), alters the initial condition to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which then evolves differently due to the factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will involve both the effect of the transformation and the original differential equation, yielding a trajectory distinct from mere evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) alone.",
