  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system's evolution is governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a positive real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine if there was an intervention altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios (varying times and magnitudes of interventions) can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), even with a constant original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The final state alone does not provide enough information to conclusively determine if or when the frequency was altered.",
