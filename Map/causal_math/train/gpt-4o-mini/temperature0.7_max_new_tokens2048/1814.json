  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents the angular frequency. We analyze the manipulation of system dynamics by introducing a Laplace transform, defined by the transformation \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\)\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\), can we accurately determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) encodes the frequency and decay information about \\\\( z(t) \\\\), but without knowing the specific value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), multiple original functions can yield the same transform results due to the ambiguity in determining oscillation frequencies solely from the transform.",
