  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output, \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is derived from the input, \\\\( x(t) \\\\), via a complex function and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bx(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential.\n\nIf the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes in a predictable manner over time without any intervention, will this result in a predictable and proportional change in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a fixed time T?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is directly affected by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through a continuous and time-invariant transformation, any predictable change in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will induce a corresponding and computable change in \\\\( z(T) \\\\), following the characteristics of the linear transformation system. The time-invariance and linearity of the transformation ensure this proportionality.",
