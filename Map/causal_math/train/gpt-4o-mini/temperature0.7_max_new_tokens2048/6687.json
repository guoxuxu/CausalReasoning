  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the effect of differentiating this function and the subsequent application of a Fourier transform.\n\nIf we apply a phase shift as an intervention to the function before differentiation, will this affect the Fourier transform of the differentiated function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a phase shift \\\\( e^{i \\\\phi} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( z(t) = e^{i (\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)} \\\\). Differentiating this modified function still affects its Fourier transform by translating its spectrum and altering amplitude characteristics due to the phase change. Thus, the intervention influences the differential operation's impact on the Fourier transform.",
