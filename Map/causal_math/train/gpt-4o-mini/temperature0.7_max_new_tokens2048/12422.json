  "Problem": "In a stochastic process, the change in a variable X is governed by the differential equation \\\\( dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is the drift coefficient, \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is the volatility coefficient, and \\\\( dW_t \\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We study how the application of a transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) impacts the process over time.\n\nIf during the process, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(X) = \\sqrt{X} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the stochastic parameters \\\\( \\mu \\\\) and \\\\( \\sigma \\\\), not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with both \\\\( h(X) \\\\) and \\\\( k(X) \\\\) drastically modify the trajectory of the system. Each transformation affects the scale and effective dynamics of the process in a nonlinear fashion, making the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) dependent on both the transformations and the original stochastic parameters.",
