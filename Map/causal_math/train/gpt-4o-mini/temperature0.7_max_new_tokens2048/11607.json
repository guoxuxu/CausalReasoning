  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is used to analyze its frequency components.\n\nIf a periodic function \\\\( s(t) = cos(\\\\omega_1 t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 as an intervention, and then \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is calculated, will the resulting spectrum's primary frequency components be solely determined by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a cosine function to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) introduces new frequency components at \\\\( \\\\pm \\\\omega_1 \\\\) which will significantly influence the spectrum. However, the spectrum will also still contain the inherent frequency components of \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Thus, the spectrum is a result of both the intervention in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the original characteristics of \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
