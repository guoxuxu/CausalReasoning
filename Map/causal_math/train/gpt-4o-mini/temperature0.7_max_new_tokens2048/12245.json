  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving in time under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) are real constants reflecting oscillatory and exponential behaviors, respectively.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t, can we deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), assuming no intervention other than the initial transformation has occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation is a standard complex exponential function, it is reversible. Knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the parameters \\\\( i\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), we can uniquely compute \\\\( z_0 = e^{-(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}z(t) \\\\), retrieving the initial state.",
