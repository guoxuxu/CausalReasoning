  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\), where w is a complex number. The transformation via Laplace transform \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to different function scenarios and the impact on causal inference is analyzed.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(t) = t^2e^{i(wt)} \\\\) is applied as an intervention before taking the Laplace transform, will the resulting transform dependent primarily on the new function \\\\( g \\\\) and not simply on \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( g(t) = t^2e^{iwt} \\\\) significantly alters the terms involved in the Laplace transform, resulting in a transform that reflects the quadratic term t^2 coupled with the original function. This modification changes both the poles and residues in the transform, making it distinctly dependent on the form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
