  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations given by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We investigate the influence of a transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\), where M is another matrix and c is a constant vector, on the solution x.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(g(x) = Nx + d\\\\) (where N is a constant matrix and d is a vector) is applied as an intervention, will the final solution vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depend only on A and not on M, N, or their constants c, and d?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(x) = Nx + d\\\\) introduces additional factors that alter the equation to \\\\(A(Nx + d) = b\\\\), which depends critically on the values of N and d, in addition to the initial transformation by M and c. As a result, the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depends on these matrices and vectors, altering the solution path.",
