  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing physical quantities. We consider the effects of applying a Fourier transform as an intervention, modifying the function to \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the original complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the transformed domain \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing any prior details about \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "As the Fourier transform provides a one-to-one correspondence for L1-integrable functions suitable for transformation, and knowing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides all the required information to precisely calculate \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform.",
