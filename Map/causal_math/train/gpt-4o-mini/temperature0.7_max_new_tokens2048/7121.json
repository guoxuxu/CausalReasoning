  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{i\\omega z}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\) are constants, in the context of complex function analysis. The scenario will analyze the impact when \\( z \\) is transformed by different contour integrations in the complex plane.\n\nIf the contour of integration around a simple pole \\( z = ia \\) is considered without any deformation or translation, will the value of the integral change if solely \\( \\omega \\) is varied?",
  "Explanation": "Varying \\( \\omega \\) directly alters the exponential function \\( e^{i\\omega z} \\), which implies changes in the oscillatory part of the integrand. Thus, this directly affects the computed value of the integral around the said pole, leading to a different result even though the pole and residue determination remain unchanged.",
