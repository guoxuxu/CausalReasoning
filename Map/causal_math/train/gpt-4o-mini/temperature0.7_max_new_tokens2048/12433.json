  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear operator transformation on a Fourier series representation of a function. Let \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} a_n e^{inx} \\\\), and the transformation is defined by \\\\( T(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\), where \\\\( b_n \\\\) are coefficients modifying the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier-transformed function at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without knowing the coefficients \\\\( b_n \\\\) used in the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the transformation coefficients \\\\( b_n \\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( a_n \\\\) from the modified coefficients \\( b_n a_n \\). Multiple different initial functions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) could result in the same observed output under different sets of \\\\( b_n \\\\).",
