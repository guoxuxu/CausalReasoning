  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The function is subjected to the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-s^2} f(s) ds \\\\). Analyze the implications of applying this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied on a complex plane and then \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is implemented, will the output necessarily be the same regardless of the variations within the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( g(f) \\\\) can change based on how the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) behaves across different parts of the complex plane. The integral transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is sensitive to changes in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) due to variations in \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\) across the domain of integration.",
