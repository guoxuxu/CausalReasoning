  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\), in a region where the potential \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is influenced by the boundary conditions. Investigate the effects of perturbing the boundary condition with an additional complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention changes the boundary condition again to include another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i \\omega z} \\\\), will the resultant potential \\\\( \\\\phi(z, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the new boundary condition set by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and not the initial \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final potential \\\\( \\\\phi(z, T) \\\\) at T > t_1 will be influenced by both the original perturbation using \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The superposition principle inherent in linear partial differential equations like the Laplace equation means that the effects of both modifications will be present and cannot be disentangled to affect only the final outcome.",
