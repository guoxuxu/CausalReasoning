  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\). Consider applying the transformation by \\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention by function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) (where \\( C \\) is another constant matrix) is applied, will the state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory from \\( t_1 \\) onwards resulting in \\( z(T) = e^{C(T-t_1)}e^{BT_1}e^{AT_1}x_0 \\). As all matrices \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) are involved in transforming the state, the end state depends on all three matrices.",
