  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = A x + B u\\\\), with A being the system matrix and B the input matrix. The input \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of time and defined by an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) x(s) ds \\\\), where K is a kernel matrix function.\n\nGiven the state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine the exact form of the kernel matrix function \\\\( K(s) \\\\) used throughout the interval [0, T] without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can result from various configurations of \\\\( K(s) \\\\), and without additional information about how \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was influenced or how \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolved over time, \\\\( K(s) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
