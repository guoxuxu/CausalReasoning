  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution along a rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial heat distribution function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and a later heat source intervention represented by \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention using a new heat source \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) affecting the temperature distribution, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the initial distribution \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and not on the intervention \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an external heat source \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\) modifies the temperature distribution directly, where the influence of the source will propagate through time. Thus, the state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) will depend on both the initial conditions and the characteristics and effects of the heat source intervention.",
