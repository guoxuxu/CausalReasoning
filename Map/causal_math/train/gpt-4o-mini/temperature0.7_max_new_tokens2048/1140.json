  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nAssuming we observe a broad spectrum in the Fourier transform output, can we deduce that an intervention like multiplication by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\) took place?",
  "Explanation": "A broad spectrum or continuous spectrum in the Fourier transform output, in the context of an initially simple exponential function like \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\), strongly indicates an intervention that altered the frequency components. Multiplication by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\) is a plausible intervention that would neutralize the frequency and spread the spectrum.",
