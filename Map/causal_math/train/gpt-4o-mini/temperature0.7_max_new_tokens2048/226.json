  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) in a complex domain where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are complex variables. Analyze how linear transformations \\\\(T(x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)\\\\) (where \\\\(a, b, c, d\\\\) are constants) affect the function.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\(f\\\\) at some time, can we determine the original coordinates \\\\(x_0, y_0\\\\) without knowing whether a transformation \\\\(T\\\\) had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T\\\\) could modify the coordinates in many ways, making it impossible to uniquely determine the original coordinates from the output value alone without additional information.",
