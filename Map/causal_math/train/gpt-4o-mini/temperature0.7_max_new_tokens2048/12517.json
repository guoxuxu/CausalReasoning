  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the variable z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant, and i is the imaginary unit. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is also a real constant.\n\nCan we correctly deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without a definitive knowledge of the application of transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), recovering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is undermined by the potential modification introduced by \\\\( e^{-Bt} \\\\). This transformation can complicate backward deductions due to changes in magnitude and phase of the original state.",
