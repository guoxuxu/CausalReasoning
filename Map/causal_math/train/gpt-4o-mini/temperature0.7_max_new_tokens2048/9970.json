  "Problem": "Evaluate the stability and causal inference of the system governed by the linear partial differential equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We consider the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\}\\\\)\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\), is it possible to accurately determine the initial state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible, meaning that one can retrieve the original state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform, regardless of the initial application of the Fourier transform, assuming no loss of information.",
