  "Problem": "Consider a multivariable control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(x) = D \\\\exp(Mt)x \\\\), with D being another constant matrix, is applied to manipulate the system state over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the exact original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) has been applied without our knowledge, D and M can alter the state in such a way that tracing back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) accurately is impossible without explicit knowledge of D's application.",
