  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v\\\\cdot\\\\nabla u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the state of the system and \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant velocity vector. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) is studied to determine its effect over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_0)\\\\) is implemented on the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\), then the system evolves according to the given PDE without further intervention. Will the state \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\) at time T be the same as if the untransformed \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was evolved to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform as an initial condition alters the spatial frequency components of \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\), and hence the derived solution \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) will differ significantly. The evolution as per the PDE respects these initial frequencies, therefore leading to a distinct state at time T.",
