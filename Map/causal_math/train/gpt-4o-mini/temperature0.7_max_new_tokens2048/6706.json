  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial form of \\\\( z(t) = te^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) integrates effects cumulatively and involves an exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\), which can obscure unique features of the original function, particularly the linear and oscillatory components. The transformation masks specific details making it impossible to reconstruct the original function uniquely.",
