  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore how the response of the system changes under the effect of external operators such as differentiation or integration over time.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = C \\\\) is used and the function is allowed to evolve as \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any external operator acting on it, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T reflect the exact influence of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function evolves naturally according to its definition with no external operations, the output at any time T directly reflects the influence of both the complex amplitude C and angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), preserving the characteristics of its initial state.",
