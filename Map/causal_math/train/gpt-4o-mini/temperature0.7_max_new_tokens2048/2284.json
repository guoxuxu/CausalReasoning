  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We explore the effects on the function after applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain exactly which transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based only on the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex due to the possible overlapping effects of the exponential factors \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\). These transformations can yield equivalent end states from different initial conditions and sequences of application, obscuring the identification of specific interventions.",
