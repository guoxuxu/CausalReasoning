  "Problem": "Consider a nondeterministic control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves over time according to a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) representing the differential of a Wiener process. We investigate how applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}z \\\\) affects the path of the system, where S is a constant, invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) knowing the matrix M but not knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The uncertainty about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the stochastic influence of \\\\( N \\\\, dW \\\\) make it impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without specific information about the initial transformation and the random effects of \\\\( dW \\\\).",
