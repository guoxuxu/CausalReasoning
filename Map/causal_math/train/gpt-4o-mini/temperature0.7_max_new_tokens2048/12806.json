  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is used to modulate an input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The output signal is given by \\\\(y(t) = z(t) \\\\cdot x(t)\\\\). The goal is to study the changes in the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) as compared to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) over time t.\n\nIf we change \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to another value \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) and continue to observe \\\\(y(t)\\\\), will the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still accurately reflect the original frequency content of \\\\(x(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) introduces a new modulation that will again alter the frequency characteristics of the output signal. The Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) for T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect this new modulation, potentially obscuring or distorting the original frequency content of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).",
