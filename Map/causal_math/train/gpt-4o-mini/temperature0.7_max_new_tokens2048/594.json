  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex scalar. A transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(m\\\\) is a complex scalar.\n\nKnowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at some time \\\\(T\\\\), can we unequivocally determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) fundamentally alters the original state \\\\(z_0\\\\). Without knowing if \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied, multiple potential original states could map to the same \\\\(z(T)\\\\) due to the properties of the exponential function in the complex domain.",
