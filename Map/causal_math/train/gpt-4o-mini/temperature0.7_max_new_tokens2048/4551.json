  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature change over time is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\), where k is a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) applied at different times.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new function \\\\( g(T) = e^{kT} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is made, will the end temperature \\\\( T(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the linear coefficient k and not on any transformations applied before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(T) = e^{kT} \\\\) introduces a significant change based on the current temperature at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which is affected by any prior transformations like \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\). Hence, the final temperature \\\\( T(T) \\\\) depends on both the initial transformation and the exponential intervention, as well as the inherent dynamics given by k.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The change in temperature over time, dT/dt, is influenced by the conductivity coefficient k, which in turn affects the temperature T. The transformations f(T) and g(T) are functions of temperature T that can influence the end temperature T(T), but the application of g(T) at time t_1 suggests that the end temperature T(T) will depend on k and the transformations applied before t_1.",
