  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane which is governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on this function over time t.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we accurately determine the initial function value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, we cannot accurately backtrack to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the amplitude scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) would lead to different potential initial states depending upon its presence or absence.",
