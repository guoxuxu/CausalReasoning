  "Problem": "Consider a transformation process where an initial function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[v](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2 + sx} v(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We analyze the causal inference between the input function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) and the transformed function \\\\( w(x) = T[v](x) \\\\) under various scenarios.\n\nGiven the output function \\\\( w(x) \\\\) from the transformation, can we deduce the original function \\\\( v(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation properties?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the integral transformation was applied or understanding the nature of \\\\( T \\\\), the transformation can be convoluted with various plausible input functions \\\\( v(x) \\\\) producing a similar output, making it challenging to uniquely identify the original function.",
