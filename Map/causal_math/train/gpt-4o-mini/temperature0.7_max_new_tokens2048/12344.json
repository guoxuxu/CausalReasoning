  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform on the function, defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time t, and Fourier Transform \\\\(F(z)\\\\) is applied, will the result \\\\( F(z) \\\\) reflect a direct transform of the function without alteration in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) linearly transforms the time-domain signal, \\\\(z(t)\\\\), to the frequency domain, reflecting the true frequency characteristics laid out by \\\\(z(t)\\\\) exactly according to the transform definition without any alterations.",
