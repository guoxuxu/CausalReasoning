  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) representing oscillatory behavior with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). We examine the scenario where we apply a Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thereby transforming the function into the frequency domain.\n\nBased on the observed data in the frequency domain, can we infer the exact time-domain signal \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without knowing the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform converts time-domain data into its frequency components. Without the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), it is impossible to reconstruct the timing or phase information accurately, as \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) determines the periodicity of the original oscillatory function.",
