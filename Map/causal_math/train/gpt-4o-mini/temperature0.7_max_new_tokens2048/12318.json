  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} - ci \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are real constants.\n\nIf at a specified time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z_{new}(t) = e^{(a+di)t} \\\\), will the affected system from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) depend solely on the original differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) in determining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the base function and potentially introduces new dynamics which are not solely determined by \\\\( D \\\\). The new constants and the interaction between old and new parameters dictate the evolved function at \\\\( t = T \\\\), concerning both \\\\( D \\\\) and the modified exponent.",
