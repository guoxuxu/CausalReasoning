  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a constant real matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, influences z(t) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new complex power transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) (where m is a positive integer) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = (k+m)*pi/A still only depend on the natural evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) and not the powers k or m?",
  "Explanation": "Applying complex power transformations as interventions changes the phase and potentially the multivalued nature of the function. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the combination of all transformations (k and m) and their sequence, not just on the natural evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\).",
