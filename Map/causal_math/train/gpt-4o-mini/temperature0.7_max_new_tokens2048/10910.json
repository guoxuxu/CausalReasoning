  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = z^2 + cz \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We study how the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, influences the function over time t.\n\nCan we reconstruct the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or determine initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) precisely at t = 0 just by knowing the transformed function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) up to some time T, without further details?",
  "Explanation": "The information lost through the integral transformation, which aggregates the function over time, complicates if not makes it impossible to uniquely pinpoint \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or \\\\( z(0) \\\\) just from \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Different initial conditions and function forms can lead to same integrated result, obscuring the original function trajectory and details.",
