  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). The function examines evolution under a rotational transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is observed, can we determine the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) at \\\\( t=0 \\\\), solely based on \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}x \\\\), without any additional information on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without exact knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\), specifically its conformation and eigenvalues, the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple matrices \\\\( A \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from different initial vectors, given the periodic nature of complex exponentials and potential degeneracies.",
