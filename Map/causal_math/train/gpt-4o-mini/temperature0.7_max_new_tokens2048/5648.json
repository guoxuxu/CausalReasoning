  "Problem": "Consider an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = -ky(t) + \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\lambda (t-s)} y(s) ds \\\\), where k and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. This models a system where the rate of change of \\\\( y \\\\) depends on both its current state and a weighted integral of its history.\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a specific endpoint \\\\( T \\\\) after an intervention, can we precisely establish whether the parameter changed was \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "The effect observed in \\\\( y(T) \\\\) could potentially result from changes in \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), or both, and these effects might be indistinguishably integrated through the integro-differential dynamics. The system's response making it is impossible to uniquely attribute changes in \\\\( y(T) \\\\) to specific parameter adjustments without additional information.",
