  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation via a linear operator represented by an integral transformation \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\int h(t - \\tau)f(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response function. The output after transformation is denoted \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the input was \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( x(t)+\\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) without further information on the system's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or the nature of any possible distortions (like \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\)), it is impossible to reverse-engineer or distinguish the exact form of the input only based on the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
