  "Problem": "Evaluate the influence of a complex transformation defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) on the stability of solutions to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the final state \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( z \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) is uniquely invertible to \\\\( w = \\log(z) \\\\), and the evolution under the given differential equation is deterministically reversible by solving it backward, \\\\( w(T) \\\\) can be traced back uniquely to \\\\( w_0 \\\\). With knowledge of \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\), \\\\( w_0 \\\\) can be determined regardless of when \\\\( z \\\\) was applied.",
