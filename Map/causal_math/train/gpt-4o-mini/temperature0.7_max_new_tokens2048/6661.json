  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) that is subjected to an integral transformation defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable. This transformation transforms the function from the time domain to the frequency domain. We explore how manipulating the function directly or its transform can affect causal inference.\n\nIf a time-domain manipulation modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = z(t)e^{at} \\\\) (where a is a real constant) at t=0, will this change the transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) compared to the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at all values of s?",
  "Explanation": "The manipulation with \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) introduces an exponential growth factor, resulting in \\\\( Z'(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t)e^{at}dt = Z(s-a) \\\\). As such, the function is shifted in the frequency domain, changing the original transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
