  "Problem": "Examine a convolution integral system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} x(\\\\tau) h(t-\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response, a known function. Changes are made to the input signal via transformation \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\), with a being a constant.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is replaced by the transformed signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve under the original convolution setup without further changes, will \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\) alters the input signal, resulting in the convolution integral producing a different output. The additive term \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) modifies each integral computation throughout the duration to T and affects the resulting output function depending on the properties of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
