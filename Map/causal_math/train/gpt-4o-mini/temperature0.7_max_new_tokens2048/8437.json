  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) the initial complex vector in a system. An integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int e^{-At}z(t) dt \\\\) impacts this setup over a period \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is set at t = 0, and evolves under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without any external intervention, is the transformed output \\\\( T[z] \\\\) solely determined by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) directly integrates the system's evolution, which depends exclusively on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without external influences, thus it is determined solely by these parameters.",
