  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the behavior under complex transformations such as \\( f(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), with \\( \\theta \\) being another real constant.\n\nFrom the observed state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine the initial state \\( z_0 \\) without knowing if \\( f(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the phase shift \\( \\theta \\) was introduced, it is impossible to tell if \\( z(T) \\) originated from \\( z_0 \\) or \\( e^{i\\theta}z_0 \\). The phase \\( \\theta \\) effectively obscures the original starting state given the similarities in the evolution pattern.",
