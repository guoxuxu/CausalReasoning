  "Problem": "Investigate the system behavior under the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( b \\\\) is a vector. We study its response when manipulated with the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z + d \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a matrix and \\\\( d \\\\) is a vector, over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is observed, can we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the absence of any transformation other than \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Simply observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not provide enough information to definitely conclude the absence of any other transformation like \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the potential similarity in outcomes resulting from different initial states and transformations.",
