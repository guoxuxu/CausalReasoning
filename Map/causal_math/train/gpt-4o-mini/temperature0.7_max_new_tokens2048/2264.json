  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over an interval [0, t].\n\nKnowing only the resulting function at time T, can we determine whether transformations \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\) or both were applied during the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at time T is influenced by both transformations in ways that are not easy to disentangle due to their respective integral impacts on the original function. Thus, the exact influence of each transformation, whether individually or in combination, cannot be ascertained without additional context or data.",
