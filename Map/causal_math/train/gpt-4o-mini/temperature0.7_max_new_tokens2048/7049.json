  "Problem": "Consider a linear function \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, used to transform complex vector input \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is determined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and this transformed vector is then evolved using \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}(Cz_0) \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) coincide with \\\\( e^{DT}(z_0) \\\\) had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) been evolved without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) modifies the initial state such that the evolution \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) acts on \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\) instead of just \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The properties and the eigenvalues of matrices C and D determine the new trajectory and generally, \\\\( e^{DT}z_0 \\\\) will not equal \\\\( e^{DT}(Cz_0) \\\\) unless C commutes with D and is a scalar matrix.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial vector z_0 is transformed by matrix C to produce the vector Cz, which is then evolved over time by the matrix D to yield z(t).
