  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of the convolution operation using a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\) with its transform \\\\( K(s) \\\\), on the system function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely determine what convolutions (with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k_1(t) \\\\), or both) were applied by observing the output at time t = T, assuming different kernels could have been used?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple convolution operations and their corresponding outcomes can result in similar outputs at t = T. Diverse kernels can affect the trajectories in non-unique ways, thus we cannot determine precisely the history and type of convolutions just by observing the output.",
