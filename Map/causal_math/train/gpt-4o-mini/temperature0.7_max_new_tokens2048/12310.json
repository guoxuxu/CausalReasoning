  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) evolved under the differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant. Investigations include the effect of executing a transformation given by the integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\), with \\( s \\) being a complex parameter.\n\nIf during evolution at a time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( \\mathcal{G}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-pt}z(t)dt \\) (where \\( p \\) is another complex constant) is applied, will the end state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend exclusively on the initial differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) represents an intervention that alters the development of \\( z \\) post-\\( t_1 \\). The impact imparted by \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) in conjunction with the original \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) manipulates the trajectory and final expression of \\( z(T) \\), making it dependent on both the transformations as well as the differential equation parameters.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) is determined by the differential system, which is influenced by the complex constant c. The function z(t) produces derivatives represented by \\dot{z}, and both the transformations \\mathcal{F}(z) and \\mathcal{G}(z) are derived from z(t), affecting the final state z(T) at time T. However, the end state z(T) is ultimately shaped by the initial differential equation, regardless of the transformations applied.",
