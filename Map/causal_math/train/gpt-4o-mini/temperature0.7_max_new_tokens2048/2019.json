  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) representing a control function. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where A is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new control function \\\\( v \\\\) is introduced at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), replacing \\\\( u \\\\), will the transformed state \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T depend only on the initial conditions and the new control \\\\( v \\\\), assuming no other interactions?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new control function \\\\( v \\\\) mid-process modifies the system's trajectory in conjunction with the earlier control \\\\( u \\\\) and the system matrices M and N. Thus, the outcome \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depends on the entire history of controls applied (both \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\)), the system dynamics, and the matrix exponential transformation \\\\( e^{At} \\\\).",
