  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We examine the influence of an external heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) modeled by the transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + q(x,t) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), which includes the heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\), was applied, it's impossible to reliably trace the original distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). The source could have significantly altered the heat profile, especially if its distribution is non-trivial.",
