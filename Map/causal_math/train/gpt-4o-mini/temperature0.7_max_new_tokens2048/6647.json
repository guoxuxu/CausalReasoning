  "Problem": "Investigate the interplay between two functions, \\\\( p(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\) and \\\\( q(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, and their effects within the integral transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( q(z) \\\\) is applied as an intervention after \\\\( t_0 \\\\) during the transformation process, will the final outcome only depend on the original function and not on the parameters of \\\\( q(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(z) = e^{az} \\\\) introduces exponential growth or decay dependent on \\\\( a \\\\), which will significantly alter the transformed result depending on the value of \\\\( a \\\\). Thus, the final transformation result is sensitive not only to the original function but also to the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) used in \\\\( q(z) \\\\).",
