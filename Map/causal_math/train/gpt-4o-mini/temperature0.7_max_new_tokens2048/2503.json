  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) \\) defined on the complex plane where \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z^t \\, dt \\), and \\( s \\) is a fixed complex number. The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(z) = z + c \\) (where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the output \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\) depend solely on the original function \\( f \\) and not on the transformations \\( g \\) or \\( h \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions \\( g(z) = z^s \\) and \\( h(z) = z + c \\) introduce new dynamics to the input of \\( f \\). The addition and exponentiation manipulate the base input \\( z_0 \\) in ways that significantly alter the result of \\( f \\), rendering the output dependent on all applied transformations.",
