  "Problem": "Consider the discrete-time system defined by the equation \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Bx\\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at n = 1 a new function \\\\(h(y) = Cy\\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied after \\\\(g(y)\\\\) was already applied at n = 0, will the final state \\\\(y(N)\\\\) for N > 1 depend solely on the properties of A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Interventions of \\\\(g\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\) at initial states introduce modifications that are propagated through the subsequent actions of A. The final state \\\\(y(N)\\\\) will bear the marks of all applied matrices: B at n = 0 and C at n = 1, along with the recurring transformations via A, making it dependent on all three matrices.",
