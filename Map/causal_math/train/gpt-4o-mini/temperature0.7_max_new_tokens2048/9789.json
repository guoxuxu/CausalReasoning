  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex number constant. The analysis focuses on the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex number constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and subsequently the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without additional intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) modifies the initial state of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) affects the trajectory of the complex function depending on the relationship between Q and P, it leads to a different final state at time T.",
