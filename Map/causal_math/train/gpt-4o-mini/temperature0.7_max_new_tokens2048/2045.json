  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a Hermitian matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is a fixed complex vector. The transformation evolves a quantum state in time t in a closed system.\n\nIf an initial quantum state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to time T without any external interference, does the evolved state at time T represent an orthogonal transformation from the initial state?",
  "Explanation": "Quantum mechanical evolution governed by a Hermitian matrix through the exponential operator \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) ensures unitarity. Thus, the magnitude and orthogonality relations in the quantum state space are preserved over time, depicting an orthogonal transformation from the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at time T.",
