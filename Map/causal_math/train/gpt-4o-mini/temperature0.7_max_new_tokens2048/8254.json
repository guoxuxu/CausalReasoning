  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The effect of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\), is applied to analyze the frequency components of z(t).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed signal \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the initial condition z(0) and the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used in z(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform gives information on the frequency components, but the phase and the original amplitude of z(0) are lost in this transformation. Only the magnitude and frequency can be determined, not the complete initial condition.",
