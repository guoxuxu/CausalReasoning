  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a function \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\) on a complex variable \\( z \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\), where \\( k \\) is a complex constant, and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nIf \\( h(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( z \\) evolves according to \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( h(z) \\) changes the initial state by a rotation of \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\), which directly influences the trajectory of the solution \\( z(t) \\). Thus, \\( z(t) \\) at T will be \\( e^{i\\omega T}z_0 e^{kT} \\), different from \\( z_0 e^{kT} \\) had \\( h(z) \\) not been applied initially.",
