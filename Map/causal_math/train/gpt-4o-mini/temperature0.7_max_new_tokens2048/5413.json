  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a vector space involving a matrix \\\\( P \\\\) representing a projection operator onto a subspace. Let us explore the changes in vectors under the operations defined by another matrix \\\\( Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is an orthogonal matrix representing a rotation.\n\nIf a vector \\\\( v \\\\) is first projected by \\\\( P \\\\) and then rotated by \\\\( Q \\\\), will the final vector be the same as rotating the vector first and then projecting it?",
  "Explanation": "Because projection and rotation are generally non-commutative operations, the order in which they are applied affects the resulting vector. Specifically, a projection reduces the vector's dimensionality, potentially changing aspects that are preserved or altered by the subsequent rotation.",

Both sequences of transformations lead to two different final vectors: Final_Vector from the projection followed by rotation and Final_Vector from rotation followed by projection.",
