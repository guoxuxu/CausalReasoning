  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) representing a controlled input.\n\nDoes modifying the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from its initial function to a different continuous function \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) affect the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) if no other intervention is performed?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) directly depends on the input function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) via an integral transformation. Changing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) alters this integral, thus affecting the output at any time \\\\( T \\\\). The linearity and dependency on the input are explicit in the integral's operator.",
