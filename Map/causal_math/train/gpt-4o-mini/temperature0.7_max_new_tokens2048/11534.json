  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in complex domain as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a mapping function given by \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\). We explore the impact of their composition \\\\( h(z) = g(f(z)) \\\\) and transformations related to the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) over a contour C, can we deduce the exact shape and nature of the contour C without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The value of an integral in the complex plane may not uniquely identify the contour, especially when multiple contours could encompass poles or avoid them similarly. Specific additional information about the residues enclosed by the contour is required.",
