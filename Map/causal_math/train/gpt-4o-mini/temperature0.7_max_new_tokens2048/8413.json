  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) operating on the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. We explore how linear transformations given by matrices affect this function through Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\), characterized as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) operates on a simple harmonic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional transformations, does \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) remain invariant under the Fourier Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is a delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), which means it effectively captures and preserves the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without altering it. Hence, the complex function remains invariant under the Fourier Transform in the frequency domain.",
