  "Problem": "Let's examine a thermal system where temperature \\( T \\) at any point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\), with \\( k \\) as the thermal diffusivity constant. We study the impact of a sudden temperature change applied using a function \\( f(T) = T + h \\), where \\( h \\) is a constant heat increment.\n\nUpon observing \\( T(x,T) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we determine whether the function \\( f(T) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) without other data?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional data about the initial state \\( T_0(x) \\) or the constant \\( h \\), it isn't possible to definitively infer if \\( T(x,t) \\) resulted from evolution of \\( T_0(x) + h \\) or \\( T_0(x) \\) alone, since diffusion could equally distribute the initial heat increment over time.",
