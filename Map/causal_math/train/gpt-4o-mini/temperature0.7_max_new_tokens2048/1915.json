  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is studied under different transformations. Here, C and D are matrices, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the outcome when transformations \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) are applied, where F and G are also constant matrices.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on D or also on F and G?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another variable to the dynamics of the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will thus depend on the interplay and effects of F, G, and D. The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) mid-evolution suggests changes in trajectory influenced by G, making the end state dependent on all matrices involved.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The variable t influences the state of z at time t, and the initial state defined by matrix C directly affects z(t). The matrix D also directly influences z(t). The transformation function h(z) applies matrix F to z, leading to a change in the state of z, which subsequently affects the end state z(T). Similarly, the transformation function g(z) applies matrix G to z, resulting in a change that also influences the end state z(T). Therefore, the end state z(T) depends on the matrices D, F, and G.",
