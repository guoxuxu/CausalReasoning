  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, under the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\). The transformation is considered at two intervals: initially at time t = 0 and after applying an intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\) is applied at a time t = T/2, does the frequency spectrum of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T depend solely on the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\), when applied, modifies the original function to become a constant (since \\\\( e^{i\\omega t}e^{-i\\omega t} = 1 \\\\)), effectuating a change in the frequency spectrum. Hence, the spectrum at t = T no longer reflects just the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), but now also depends on the intervention applied.",
