  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + At + B \\\\), where A and B are constants. Analysis is done on the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Uz \\\\), where U is a constant matrix, that modifies the trajectory of z.\n\nGiven the observed transformed function \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it feasible to accurately identify whether only U was applied at t=0 and/or V was applied at T_1, just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions used (U alone, V alone, both, or in sequence) from the function at T is not feasible as different combinations of U and V can yield similar transformations, particularly without knowledge of their specific matrix values and the precise times of application.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The time variable t directly influences the function z(t), while the constants A and B also contribute to z(t). The function z(t) is transformed by applying the linear transformation h(z), which involves the constant matrix U, leading to the transformed function z(T). Additionally, the application of another variable V can also affect z(T), indicating that both U and V can influence the final output z(T).",
