  "Problem": "Consider a system where the variable \\\\(z\\\\) is transformed by the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\\\). We analyze the outcome of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) where \\\\(n = 0, 1, ..., N-1\\\\) and its implications on the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(f(z_n)\\\\) is applied to each element in the sequence, and then the DFT is taken of this transformed sequence, will the spectrum be the same as if the DFT was directly applied to the original sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z_n) = e^{iz_n}\\\\) before the DFT transforms each element by adding a phase shift dependent on the value of each \\\\(z_n\\\\). This alteration changes the magnitude and phase of the spectrum, resulting in a different frequency representation compared to applying the DFT directly to the untransformed sequence.",
