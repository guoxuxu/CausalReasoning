  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant coefficients. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system over time t, where C is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the complex initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing the system's state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some later time T, not knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied originally?",
  "Explanation": "Without clarity on whether transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was employed, and considering its potential impact on the trajectory, you cannot uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The modification introduced by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could mask or alter the initial state sufficiently to prevent a backward calculation.",
