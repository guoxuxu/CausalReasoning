  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) which maps complex numbers under the transformation \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\). We study its effects on waves modeled by the integral transformation \\\\(x(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} z(w)e^{iwt} dw\\\\).\n\nAfter observing \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T, can one determine the initial form of the wave function before the transformation \\\\(z(w)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\(e^{iw}\\\\) modifies each frequency component's phase, it is generally not possible to uniquely reconstruct the original wave form solely from the transformed waveform at a later time, especially without knowledge of the phases affected by the initial transformation.",
