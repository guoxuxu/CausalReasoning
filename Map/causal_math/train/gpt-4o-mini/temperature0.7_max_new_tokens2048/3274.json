  "Problem": "Consider the operation of convolution on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) with a system impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) producing the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\). We explore the causality implications of this convolution under a transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * F(t) \\\\) where \\\\( F(t) \\\\) is another kernel function.\n\nCan we uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by knowing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) obtained from the convolution of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation by \\\\( F(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * F(t) \\\\) transforms the input in such a way that it cannot be reliably reversed without explicit knowledge of \\\\( F(t) \\\\). The presence of \\\\( F(t) \\\\) alters the characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), producing a \\\\( y(t) \\\\) that is non-invertible back to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) alone.",
