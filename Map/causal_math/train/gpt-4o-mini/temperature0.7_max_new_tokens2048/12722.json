  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving in time according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. The system's evolution is further examined under an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Ps} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-Qt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where Q is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces a cumulative effect influenced by Q, altering how the function is integrated and evolves, which affects the final state at time T, making it dependent on both P and Q.",
