  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + k^2 u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x)dx\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and its alteration after a transformation defined by \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of \\\\(v(x)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(v(x)\\\\), \\\\(w(x)\\\\), or both) only by observing the Fourier transform results?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of linear combinations of functions, such as those with added linear or quadratic terms, can result in similar spectral features that are difficult to parse out distinctly. Hence, the specific forms of \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\) and their presence in the final observed transform cannot be uniquely determined.",
