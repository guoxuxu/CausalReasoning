  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing the system's state over time. We analyze the impact of a Hilbert transform \\\\( H \\\\) which transforms a real function into another real function, typically shifting each frequency component by \\\\(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\).\n\nCan the original function state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be accurately deduced from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the Hilbert transform \\\\( H \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Hilbert transform was applied, one cannot definitively infer \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The phase shift introduced by \\\\( H \\\\) can significantly change the evolution path, making back-calculation to the original state ambiguous.",
