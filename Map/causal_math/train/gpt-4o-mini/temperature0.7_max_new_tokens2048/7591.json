  "Problem": "Evaluate the system of differential equations characterized by the Laplace transform of functions and their inverse. Let \\\\( X(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of a function x(t), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) the transfer function of a linear system. The response of the system is given by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied to the system output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) affects the final system response by altering the overall system characteristics. The final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), as these transformations modify the output in sequence, impacting the frequency and time-domain characteristics of the response.",
