  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( R(z) = z + c \\\\) (where c is a constant complex number) is applied, will the outcome of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( s \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( R(z) \\\\) adds a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\) to the function, altering both the form and trajectory of the integral transformation onwards from \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Thus, the final state of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) reflects the influences of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( s \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\), and not solely \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
