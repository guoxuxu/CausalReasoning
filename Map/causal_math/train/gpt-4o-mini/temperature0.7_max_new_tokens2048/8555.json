  "Problem": "Imagine a mechanical system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + p\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. An external force described by a function \\\\(f(t) = A\\\\sin(ωt)\\\\) is potentially applied to the system, affecting its behavior.\n\nIf the external force \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is applied at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), say \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), can the system's response at time T be found by only solving the homogeneous equation?",
  "Explanation": "With the application of the force, the system's behavior is influenced by both the inherent characteristics of the system and the external intervention. The response at time T will be described by both the homogeneous and particular solutions, where the latter directly considers the impact of the external force.",
