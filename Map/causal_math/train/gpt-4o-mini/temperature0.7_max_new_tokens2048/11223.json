  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function describes the evolution of a complex number over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T{[z]} = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to study the cumulative effect over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( z(t) = z(t) e^{-i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\) depend solely on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( e^{-i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) adds another frequency component to the function, affecting the overall behavior and the result of the transformation. The outcome of \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), as their interaction modifies the function’s evolution.",
