  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\\\overline{z}} \\\\), where A and B are complex constants and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of z. We investigate the impact of a subsequent transformation \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), where C is a non-zero complex constant, applied over the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( v(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane and allowed to evolve without further transformations, will the value of \\\\( v(z) \\\\) at any point \\\\( z \\\\) be proportional to \\\\( u(z) \\\\) at that point?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), for any point z, \\\\( v(z) \\\\) remains directly proportional to \\\\( u(z) \\\\) by the constant factor C. The properties and evolution of \\\\( u(z) \\\\) on the complex plane are preserved up to a scaling by C, with no change in underlying behavior or distribution.",
