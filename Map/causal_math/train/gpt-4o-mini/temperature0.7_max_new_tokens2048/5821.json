  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{tA}x\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix with complex eigenvalues and \\\\(x\\\\) is an initial complex vector. We investigate the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied initially to \\\\(x\\\\) so that the initial condition becomes \\\\(z_0 = Ux\\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) equal \\\\(e^{TA}x\\\\) when calculated without the application of \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) changes the initial state, which affects the entire evolution of the system under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\). Since \\\\(U\\\\) is unitary, it preserves the norm but can modify eigenvector directions, thus leading to a different endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) compared to just evolving \\\\(x\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\).",
