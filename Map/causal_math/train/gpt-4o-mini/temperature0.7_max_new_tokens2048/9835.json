  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing oscillations influenced by a damping constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). The function is transformed using the Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the functions to \\\\( x'(t) = ax(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y'(t) = ay(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a scalar amplification, does this alteration change the subsequent form of the Laplace transform \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) as compared to the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
