  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional region. An external source modifies the boundary conditions at specific points through a function represented by \\\\(v(x, y) = e^{i\\\\omega(x+y)}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nBy knowing the internal potential \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine if \\\\(v(x, y)\\\\), \\\\(w(x, y)\\\\), or both were applied on the boundary?",
  "Explanation": "The internal potential \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) does not retain distinct traces of which specific functions were applied at the boundary, especially considering their potential to produce equivalent or overlapping effects within the two-dimensional region governed by the Laplace equation.",
