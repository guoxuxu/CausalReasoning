  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the dynamics of this function under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally according to its definition without any external intervention, will the Fourier transform result at \\\\( s = w \\\\) be qualitatively different compared to other values of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( s = w \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(s-w) \\\\), indicating a spike at \\\\( s = w \\\\). This is qualitatively distinct from its behavior at other values of \\\\( s \\\\), where the integral essentially evaluates to zero due to the oscillatory nature of \\\\( e^{i(w-s)t} \\\\).",
