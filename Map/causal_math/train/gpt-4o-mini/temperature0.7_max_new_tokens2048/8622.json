  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional space where we deal with the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace Transform. We analyze the causality and effect relations within signals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and their Laplace Transforms \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\).\n\nGiven a Laplace Transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at some \\\\( s = T \\\\), can we always uniquely determine the original time function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that generated it?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the necessary and sufficient conditions are fulfilled for the function and the Laplace transform to be well-defined and inversely transformable, yes, it is possible to uniquely determine the original time function. The Laplace Transform is a bijective operation in its domain of interest, mapping each unique time-domain function to a unique complex function in the frequency domain.",
