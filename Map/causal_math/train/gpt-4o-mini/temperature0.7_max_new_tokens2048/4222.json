  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing if transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), it is unclear whether the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\) resulted from a transformation related phase-shift or solely from the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\). The phase factor \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) could have altered the state in ways that cannot be easily disentangled without additional information.",
