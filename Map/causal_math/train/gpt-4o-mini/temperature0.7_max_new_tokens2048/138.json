  "Problem": "Consider a vector field given by \\\\( v(z) = iz \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transformation of the form \\\\( f(z) = \\int_{\\gamma} e^{zt} dz \\\\), where \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, is applied to this vector field over time t.\n\nGiven a vector in the field at time t = T, can we uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it might have altered the trajectory of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) substantially depending on the properties of \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) and t. Without this information, retracing the vector's path to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can lead to erroneous conclusions.",
