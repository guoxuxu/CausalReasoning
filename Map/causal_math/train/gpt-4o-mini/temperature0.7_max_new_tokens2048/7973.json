  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function represents a signal in the complex plane, oscillating with time. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function to analyze its spectral properties.\n\nIf the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is computed without intervention, will the resulting function indicate a single frequency component at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) yields a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), reflecting that the original time-domain signal is a pure tone at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Thus, the effect directly displays this frequency component without any interventions altering the outcome.",
