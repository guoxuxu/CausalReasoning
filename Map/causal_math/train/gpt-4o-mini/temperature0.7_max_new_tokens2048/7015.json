  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit represented by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the frequency complex variable, and circuit behavior is regulated by this impedance function. The circuit undergoes a Fourier transformation which impacts the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf, at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new signal modification through a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( R(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( K(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through convolution with \\\\( K(t) \\\\) alters the output response, which now becomes a convolution of the response due to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and the kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\). This changes the endpoint \\\\( R(T) \\\\), making it dependent on both \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( K(t) \\\\).",
