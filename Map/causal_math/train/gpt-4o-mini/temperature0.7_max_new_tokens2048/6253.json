  "Problem": "A physical system's temperature distribution, u(x,t), satisfies the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + Ce^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where C and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants, is studied to evaluate its effect on the system.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 and letting it evolve under the heat equation change the temperature distribution at a later time t = T compared to just letting \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) evolve under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding \\\\( C \\\\) which evolves exponentially with time. This impacts the distribution, making it deviate from the path it would follow under the heat equation alone, accounting for the integration of the transformation over time.",
