  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a circular motion in the complex plane. We then examine the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nGiven the state at \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\), and knowing an intervention occurred, can we determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the value of \\\\( z(\\pi) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the transformations and intervention can overlap in the complex plane due to their respective impacts on phase and magnitude. Multiple combinations of applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could yield the same endpoint, especially given the periodic nature of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This non-uniqueness prevents clear inference of the interventions used.",
