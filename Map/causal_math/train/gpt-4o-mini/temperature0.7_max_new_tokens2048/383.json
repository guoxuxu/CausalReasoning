  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of the operator \\( L[y] = \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + py \\) on the function \\( y(x) = e^{rx} \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( r \\) are constants. The main focus is on the causal relationship observed when transforming the function through this differential operator and exploring the impact of inserting an arbitrary function \\( h(x) = qx^2 \\) (where \\( q \\) is a constant) into the system.\n\nIf the function \\( h(x) = qx^2 \\) is added as an intervention to \\( y(x) \\) before applying \\( L[y] \\), will the output still be a simple scalar multiple of \\( e^{rx} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding \\( h(x) = qx^2 \\) to \\( y(x) \\) results in \\( y(x) + h(x) = e^{rx} + qx^2 \\). Applying \\( L \\) gives \\( L[y+h] = L[e^{rx}] + L[qx^2] = (r^2 + p)e^{rx} + (2q + pqx^2) \\), which is not a scalar multiple of \\( e^{rx} \\). It includes additional polynomial terms.",
