  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = iAz \\\\), where A is a constant real number that dictates the rate of rotation in the complex plane. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{-At}z \\\\) over time t.\n\nFrom observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time t = T, can we infer the initial complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowledge of whether transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, the inherent properties of the rotational differential equation and the nature of the transformation (which just shifts phase temporally) ensure that the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) converges back to a path that would be consistent with one started directly from \\\\(z_0\\\\). Thus, the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) can be deduced from \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
