  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers. The transformation is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We examine the differential effects of this transformation on the trajectories of points in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allows the point to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the point's trajectory at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply left to evolve naturally to time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the initial condition by applying the complex exponential, which impacts both the growth rate and rotation of the point's trajectory in the complex plane. This leads to a different trajectory than if the point had evolved without the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
