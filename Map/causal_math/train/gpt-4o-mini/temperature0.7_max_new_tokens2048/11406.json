  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across an object is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity, and \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effects of applying a thermal source function described by \\\\( f(u) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} u \\\\) on the temperature distribution over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we determine the original temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\), the changed initial conditions due to the thermal source function could significantly affect the subsequent evolution of temperature, rendering unreliable any retracing to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) only based on \\\\( u(t) \\\\) under the heat equation.",
