  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), on this function over the frequency domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) directly and uniquely from observing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) produced by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)(z(t))?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a peak in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) at a specific point directly indicates the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The relationship is 1-to-1, allowing for a direct inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without ambiguity.",
