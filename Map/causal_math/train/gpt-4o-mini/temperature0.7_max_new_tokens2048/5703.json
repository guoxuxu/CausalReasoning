  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant representing the angular frequency and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an initially real-valued function. The impact of Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is studied to understand its transformation properties and the system behavior.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the new transform \\\\( Z''(s) \\\\) solely reflect the change in \\\\( u(t) \\\\) with original \\\\( \\omega \\\\), without showing effects from the new \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the angular frequency to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\), which affects both the phase and the frequency components of the output signal represented in the complex plane. Therefore, \\\\( Z''(s) \\\\) will manifest changes due to both the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the new frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\), altering the properties of the transform significantly.",
