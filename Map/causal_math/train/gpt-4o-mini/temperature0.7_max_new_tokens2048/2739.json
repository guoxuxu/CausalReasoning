  "Problem": "We examine a system governed by the heat equation in a rod, \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(x\\\\) is the position along the rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal conductivity. Consider an initial sinusoidal temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\pi x)\\\\). Suppose an external heating function \\\\(h(x, t) = H e^{-t}\\\\sin(\\\\omega x)\\\\) is applied, modifying the temperature.\n\nIf the heating function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is applied continuously from the start, will the temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > 0 represent a superposition of the initial condition's influence and the effect of the external heating?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of the external heating function, the temperature profile evolves as a superposition of the solution to the homogeneous equation and the particular solution driven by \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\). This results in a profile influenced by both the initial sinusoidal distribution and the external heating.",
