  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation considered is applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\) is applied to the initial function and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the resulting temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) was directly evolved to T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the initial condition from \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) to a different function, altering the initial spectrum of temperature distribution. This change in the spectral composition modifies how heat propagates along the rod, leading to a different temperature profile at time T.",
