  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and the function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane. This function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) which is the Laplace transform, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the result without knowing \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\). Without the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\), the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined since any change in \\\\( s \\\\) affects the outcome of the transform dramatically.",
