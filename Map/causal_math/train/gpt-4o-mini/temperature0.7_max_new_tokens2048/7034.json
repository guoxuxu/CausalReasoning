  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the equation \\\\(z'(t) = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit, and \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix. We are examining the role of the operator \\\\(T(z) = e^{Bt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, in transforming the state of the system over time.\n\nIs it possible to exactly infer the initial state \\\\(z(0)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) by observing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\(z(0)\\\\), because the transformation \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) might have modified the initial conditions in ways that cannot be exactly reversed without additional information.",
