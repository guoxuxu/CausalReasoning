  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation describing heat transfer \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We study the impact of applying a Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from observing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time t without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) was applied, it's difficult to uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution, as the transformation into the frequency domain may alter characteristics that are not recoverable uniquely after evolution, especially if there was any information loss or practical alteration like numerical computation impacts.",
