  "Problem": "Let's consider the complex plane where the function is defined as \\( z \\mapsto w = e^z \\). Investigate how the transformation of this function affects the analytical structure of a complex domain, specifically whether causal inference about the original complex value (z) can be derived from its transformation (w) under various circumstances.\n\nGiven the final observed outcome \\( w \\) after applying the intervention \\( w = e^{z+C} \\), can we uniquely identify the intervention (the value of C) and the original z?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the no-intervention case, the final result \\( w \\) can result from various combinations of C and z due to the periodic nature of the exponential function. Hence, the outcome \\( w \\) alone cannot uniquely decide both C and z without additional information or constraints.",
