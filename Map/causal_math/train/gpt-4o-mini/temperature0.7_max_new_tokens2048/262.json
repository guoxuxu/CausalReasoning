  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. This setup is used to analyze the interaction between the two exponential terms over time.\n\nIf the resultant complex function value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is known, can one uniquely identify the original vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) without prior knowledge of their involvement?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) because the contributions from \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}y \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can overlap, allowing multiple potential combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) that could result in the same observed outcome.",
