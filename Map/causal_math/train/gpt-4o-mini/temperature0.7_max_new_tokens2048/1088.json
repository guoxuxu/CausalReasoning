  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane which is governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on this function over time t.\n\nUsing knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitively state whether transformations such as \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( k(z) \\\\) were applied, and in which sequence, solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of \\\\( alpha \\\\) and \\\\( beta \\\\) values, and different sequence timings for applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\). The interplay between the exponential growth factors and the intrinsic rotations makes it ambiguous and non-trivial to unravel the exact interventions from the final state alone.",
