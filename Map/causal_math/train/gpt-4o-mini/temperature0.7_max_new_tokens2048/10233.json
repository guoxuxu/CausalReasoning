  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore how different transformations influence this function, specifically transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different times.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and allow the system to evolve naturally, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if it were evolved without applying \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( T_1(e^{it}) = e^{e^{it}} \\\\) substantially modifies the growth and oscillatory behavior of the function, the path and final state at time T are altered compared to the natural evolution of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\).",
