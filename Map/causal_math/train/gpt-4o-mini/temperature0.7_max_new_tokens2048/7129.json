  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on a vector space, where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, analyze how the Fourier transform affects the signal when represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-2\\\\pi ist}x(t) dt \\\\). We examine the transformation sequences and their reversibility in different intervention scenarios.\n\nDoes applying the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) to a vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then computing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) yield the same result as applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) first and then applying a transformed version of \\\\( M \\\\) in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( M \\\\) prior to the Fourier transform modifies the time-domain signal and thus alters the frequency spectrum. A subsequent Fourier transform on the modulated signal \\\\( Mx(t) \\\\) does not correspond to just transforming the frequency components by \\\\( M \\\\), as the Fourier transform of a matrix transformation is not simply the matrix applied to the transformed data.",
