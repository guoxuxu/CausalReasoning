  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is determined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. The transformations used are \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and an external force represented by \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to the position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\) without further intervention, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( x_0^2 \\\\), this nonlinear transformation alters the trajectory of the particle under the differential equation, affecting the position at time T.",
