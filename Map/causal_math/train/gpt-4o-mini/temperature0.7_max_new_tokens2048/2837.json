  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nIf \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any given \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation and the system's equation is linear and time-invariant, so the evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the subsequent transformation by \\\\( F(x) \\\\) commute. Thus, \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) remains unaffected by the order of operations.",
