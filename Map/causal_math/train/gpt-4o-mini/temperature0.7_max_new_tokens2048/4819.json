  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{gz} \\\\) where g is a complex constant. This function is used to transform the path of integration in the complex plane for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_C e^{z^2} dz \\\\), where C is initially the real axis from -∞ to +∞.\n\nIf a new transforming function \\\\( h(z) = e^{mz} \\\\) (where m is another complex constant) is applied at a midpoint during the integral's evaluation along \\\\( C' \\\\), will the final value of \\\\( I \\\\) solely depend on the original function \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\) without influence from g or m?",
  "Explanation": "The application of another transforming function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces further modification to the path and potentially to the domain characteristics relevant for the integral. The ultimate value of \\\\( I \\\\) will thus depend not only on the original function but also critically on the influence of both transformations imposed by g and m, affecting how the poles, residues, or branch cuts are navigated.",
