  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(t\\\\) is real time variable. We study the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{is}ds * z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function form at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the presence of the integral transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\), the changes brought about by multiplying the exponential by the integrated function make it impossible to distinctly retrieve the original function unless additional information about the intervention is provided.",
