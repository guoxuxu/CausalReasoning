  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The role of the Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) on this system is analyzed.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the constants \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) in the original differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the algebraic form of the Laplace transform of the differential equation. The function's s-domain form directly depends on these parameters, allowing their values to be extracted by evaluating the relations given by the transformed equation.",
