  "Problem": "Evaluate the influence of a complex transformation defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) on the stability of solutions to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( h(w) = e^{cw^2} \\\\) (where c is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final value \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely based on the behavior of the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(w) = e^{cw^2} \\\\) introduces non-linear complexities into the system. As a result, the final state \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\) involves interactions dependent on the initial state, the nature of the differential equation, and the non-linear effect of the intervention, changing the trajectory and output of the system in a manner not solely predictable by the original \\\\( kw \\\\) dynamics.",
