  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + xu_x = 0 \\), where \\( u(t, x) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) and space \\( x \\). Investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\xi x}u(t, x)dx \\) on the system over time.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial function \\( u(0, x) \\) from \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the initial Fourier transform, the back transformation might yield erroneous results, particularly considering phase shifts and the possibility of loss of information in frequency space, depending on \\( \\xi \\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(t, x) evolves over time, influencing its time derivative u_t and its spatial derivative u_x. The relationship u_t + xu_x equals zero describes the dynamics of u(t, x). The Fourier transform of u(t, x), denoted as hat{u}(t, ξ), is derived from u(t, x), allowing us to analyze the system in the frequency domain. The ability to reconstruct the initial function u(0, x) from hat{u}(T, ξ) is contingent on whether the Fourier transform was applied at t=0.",
