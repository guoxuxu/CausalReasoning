  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) in the complex plane, representing circular motion with unit radius and angular velocity of 1 radian per unit time. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), particularly focusing on the Laplace transform for different values of the complex variable s.\n\nIf the system is observed begining from \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) and evolves naturally without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > 0 remain unchanged if the Laplace transform is computed as described?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of the system \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is independent of the Laplace transform computation. The transform is an analysis tool and does not affect the real-time evolution of the system.",
