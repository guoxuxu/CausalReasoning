  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) in which both x and y are differentiable real-valued functions of t. We apply a transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) where A is a constant real number and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then permitted to evolve under the operation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = az \\\\) without further manipulation, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = az \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) modifies the initial phase and amplitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), impacting how it evolves under the differential operation. Since \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) adjusts the phase of the complex number, the resulting trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ.",
