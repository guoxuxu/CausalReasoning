  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\), can we infer the exact original function, specifically its frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The form of the Laplace transform \\\\(T[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega}\\\\) uniquely determines \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) as the imaginary part of the pole, allowing for exact inference of the original function's frequency.",
