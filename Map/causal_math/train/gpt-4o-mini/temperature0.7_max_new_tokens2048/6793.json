  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = T^{-1}e^{Dt}Tx \\\\) is considered, where T is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the starting vector, altering the trajectory under the system's dynamics. Since \\\\( h(x) \\\\) applies an exponential operation that modifies the phases and growth rates different components of \\\\( x \\\\), the state at time T will generally be different unless \\\\( T^{-1}e^{Dt}T \\\\) commutes with \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\).",
