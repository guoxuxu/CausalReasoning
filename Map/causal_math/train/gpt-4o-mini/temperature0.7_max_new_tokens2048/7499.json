  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation being considered is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention. Will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively rely on the dynamics \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) adds another layer of complex exponential rotation, making the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the first transformation and the intervention frequency \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), alongside the inherent dynamics of the system.",
