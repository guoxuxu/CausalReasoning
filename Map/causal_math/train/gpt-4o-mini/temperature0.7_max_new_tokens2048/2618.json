  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation over complex functions, where the input function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed via a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\), resulting in output \\\\( y(t) = (K * z)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(t-\\\\tau)z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to both the kernel and the input function is considered.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing the Fourier transform was applied to \\\\( K(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the nature of the kernel transformation (Fourier transform in this case) is unknown, the deconvolution problem can be ill-posed, meaning that without knowing the form of \\\\( K(t) \\\\) after transformation, accurately retrieving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is infeasible.",

The kernel K(t) is transformed into its Fourier representation, and similarly, z(t) is also transformed into its Fourier representation. The Fourier transform of K(t) results in the Fourier transform of the output y(t). If the Fourier transform of K(t) is known, it can help in determining z(t) from its Fourier transform.",
