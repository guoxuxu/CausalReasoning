  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over time t, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number. We are interested in the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds\\\\) applied to z.\n\nGiven the transformation output \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\), can we definitively determine the time \\\\(t_1\\\\) at which an intervention (such as applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\)) occurred, just by examining \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the transformation output \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) accumulates evidence of any interventions, its integral nature obfuscates the exact moment of transition unless additional information, like the nature and effects of specific changes to z(t), are known. The transformation's output by itself lacks specificity about when changes occurred.",
