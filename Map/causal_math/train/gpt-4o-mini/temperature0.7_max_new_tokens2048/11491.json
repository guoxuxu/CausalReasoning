  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant. Analyses concern how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant, affect the function's behavior over iterations.\n\nAssuming at a certain iteration \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the behavior of the trajectory at iteration t for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be independent of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and depend only on \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The behavior will depend on both \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), as well as the constant \\\\( c \\\\). Both \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduce rotations which influence the trajectory in the complex plane in different ways, thereby affecting each subsequent iteration under \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) depends on the complex constant c, and the transformation g(z) affects the output of f(z). The intervention h(z) influences the trajectory of the iterations. The angle θ affects g(z) and thus the trajectory, while the angle φ directly influences h(z) and the trajectory as well. Therefore, the trajectory at iteration t for t > t_1 is dependent on φ and c, but also on θ due to its effect through g(z).",
