  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf an additional matrix transformation \\\\( S(A) = C^{-1}AC \\\\) is applied after \\\\( T(A) \\\\) at some point, will the eigenvalues of the final matrix depend only on the eigenvalues of \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation, involving \\\\( C \\\\) after the initial transformation by \\\\( B \\\\), will still result in a matrix that has the same eigenvalues as \\\\( A \\\\), despite going through two different transformations. This is because both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) transformations are similarity transformations, and eigenvalues are invariant under such transformations.",
