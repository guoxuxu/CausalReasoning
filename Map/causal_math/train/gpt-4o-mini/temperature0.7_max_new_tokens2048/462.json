  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing an oscillatory system. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output, can we precisely deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t without knowing its initial form?",
  "Explanation": "The information in the Fourier transform is limited to frequency content and neglects phase information. Without additional specifications such as initial conditions or phase information, the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined just from \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",
