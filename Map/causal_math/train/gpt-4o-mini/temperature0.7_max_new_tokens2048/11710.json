  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions describing a signal. The signal undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nCan the original signal \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be accurately reconstructed from \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) without knowing the transformations or operations applied in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is reversible through its inverse, and the transformations corresponding to operations in the time domain have specific, known effects in the frequency domain. Therefore, \\\\(z(t)\\\\) can be reconstructed reliably as long as the nature of \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) is preserved.",
