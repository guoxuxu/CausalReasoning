  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(z(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a given function and \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the behavior of this transformation, specifically how it behaves under modifications of \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is modified to \\\\(af(x)\\\\) for some scalar \\\\(a\\\\), and then \\\\(z(w)\\\\) is computed without further intervention, will the resulting transformation \\\\(z(w)\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(f(x)\\\\) was not scaled by \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling \\\\(f(x)\\\\) by \\\\(a\\\\) directly scales the integral, resulting in \\\\(z(w) = a\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\). This implies a scaling effect on the transform, so the outcome will be scaled by \\\\(a\\\\), not unchanged.",
