  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nGiven the final transformation output \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\), can we determine the original complex number z without knowing whether the squaring transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the squaring function, the mapping from \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) to a resultant value can either be direct or squared, each mapping to potentially different original values. Different values of z might yield the same output due to the periodic nature of the exponential function.",
