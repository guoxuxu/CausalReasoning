  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. Let us examine the impact of an integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, over the time interval [0, t].\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the lack of knowledge about the application of \\( g(z) \\), the integration involving \\( D \\) modifies the trajectory in a manner that may not be reversible, particularly if \\( D \\) and \\( C \\) have different eigenvalues or do not commute.",
