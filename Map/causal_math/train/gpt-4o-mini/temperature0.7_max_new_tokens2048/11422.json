  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its impact on an integral transform described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We explore how the Laplace Transform of this function changes under different scenarios.\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be deduced by observing the poles of the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after transformation without information about the initial value?",
  "Explanation": "The poles of the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) are directly influenced by the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) due to the relation \\\\( s = -i\\\\omega \\\\). Observing the location of the poles can thus reveal the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), even without knowing the exponential term's initial phase or magnitude.",
