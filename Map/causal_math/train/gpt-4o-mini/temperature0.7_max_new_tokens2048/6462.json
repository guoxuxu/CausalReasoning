  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of the integral transformation \\\\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\\\) on the function \\\\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\\\( f(t) \\\\\\) from \\\\\\( F(s) \\\\\\) after transformation by \\\\\\( T \\\\\\), knowing the type of \\\\\\( f(t) \\\\\\) (sine function), without additional information on \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though we know \\\\\\( f(t) \\\\\\) is a sine function, the exact frequency parameter \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) cannot be determined solely from \\\\\\( F(s) \\\\\\) unless we have specific values or additional constraints on \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\). Multiple \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) values can satisfy given \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) values depending on the configuration of \\\\\\( s^2 + \\\\omega^2 \\\\\\) in the denominator.",
