  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the square root of -1 and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the transformation under a subsequent function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nKnowing the function result \\\\( h(z(T)) \\\\), can the original integration parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be determined at T without knowing the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z^2 \\\\) changes both the modulus and argument of the original integral result, making it non-trivial to extract the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) accurately without knowing that the squaring transformation has been applied.",
