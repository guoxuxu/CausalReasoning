  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) applied to elements in the complex plane. We analyze the effects of performing a linear transformation on z via a matrix M before and after applying the function.\n\nIf a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) is first transformed by the matrix \\\\(M\\\\) and then the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied, will the outcome at some point t be the same as if \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied first and then transformed by \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation sequence affects the outcome because matrix multiplication is not generally commutative with function application. Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) first and then \\\\(M\\\\) would yield different results as the exponential function would have already mapped the values to different locations in the complex plane before the linear transformation.",
