  "Problem": "Consider the system described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). The system is analyzed for the impact of multiplying by a polynomial function \\\\( p(t) = t^k \\\\) and then taking the Laplace transform again. Here, \\\\( k \\\\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nGiven \\\\( H(s) \\\\), the transform of \\\\( h(t) = t^k g(t) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) without the value of \\\\( k \\\\) does not uniquely specify \\\\( g(t) \\\\) because the differentiation of order \\\\( k \\\\) in the transform domain (which derives from the multiplication by \\\\( t^k \\\\) in the time domain) is essential for correctly inverting the transform to recover \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
