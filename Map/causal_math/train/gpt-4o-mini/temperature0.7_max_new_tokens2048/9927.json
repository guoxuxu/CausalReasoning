  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Let's analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number with positive real part.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), causing a new function \\\\(z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t}\\\\), will the resulting transformed function \\\\(T[z'(t)]\\\\) be solely determined by \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) and independent of the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function \\\\(z'(t)\\\\) after the intervention distinctly depends on \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\), and upon applying the transformation \\\\(T\\\\), the outcome \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega'}\\\\) reflects only the new frequency \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\). Therefore, the outcome is independent of the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of omega influences the function z(t), which in turn affects the transformed function T[z(t)]. When omega is modified to omega prime, it leads to a new function z'(t), which then influences the transformed function T[z'(t)]. Thus, T[z'(t)] is determined by omega prime and is independent of the original omega.",
