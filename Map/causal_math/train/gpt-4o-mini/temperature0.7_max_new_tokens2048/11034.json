  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( T \\\\) applied to the initial conditions over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation T was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of matrix T, any inference about the original \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is underdetermined because the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) could have modified the initial conditions in multiple possible ways, particularly if M and T do not have simple algebraic relations like commutativity.",
