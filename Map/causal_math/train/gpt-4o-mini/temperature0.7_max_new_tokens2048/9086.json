  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) representing a heat distribution over a rod along the spatial variable x and time t, governed by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effects of applying a source term \\( S(x,t) \\), which varies along x and t.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\( u(x,T) \\) at time \\( t = T \\), can we determine whether the source term \\( S(x,t) \\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information on the presence or absence of the source term or details about the initial conditions, it is challenging to attribute changes in the distribution \\( u(x,T) \\) directly to \\( S(x,t) \\) or the initial setup.",
