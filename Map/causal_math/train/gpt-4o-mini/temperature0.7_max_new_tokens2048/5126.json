  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network involving a complex impedance function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where s is the complex frequency, and a, b, c are constants. An impulse response h(t) of this network is obtained through the inverse Laplace transform of Z(s).\n\nCan we determine the precise value of 'a' after measuring the impulse response h(t) at time T without knowing the original function Z(s)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the complete knowledge of the function Z(s), specifically constants b and c, the specific contributions of these parameters to the observed h(t) cannot be isolated, making it impossible to unambiguously determine 'a' from h(t) alone.",
