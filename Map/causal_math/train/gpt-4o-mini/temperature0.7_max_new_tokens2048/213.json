  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under the system described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to what would have been obtained if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) significantly alters the initial conditions. Since \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) affects both real and imaginary components differently, depending on C, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will likely differ from the untransformed trajectory.",
