  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + p(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a position-dependent velocity field. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a specific time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\), such as a convolution with a Gaussian kernel, is applied as an intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial PDE and not on the actions of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform will reflect both the effects of the initial evolution due to the PDE and the convolution intervention. As \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) can significantly alter the energy distribution across the Fourier modes, its effect cannot be isolated from that resulting from the initial PDE.",
