  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), on this function and analyzing its impact on the system's dynamics.\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be uniquely identified by observing its Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\), and the pole at \\\\( s = i \\\\omega \\\\) directly indicates the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This information is explicitly preserved and can be uniquely identified from the transform, allowing for accurate inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the effect back to the cause.",
