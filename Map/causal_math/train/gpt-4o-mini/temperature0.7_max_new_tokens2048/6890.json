  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) by observing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) and assuming no intermediate transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "By knowing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) and the properties of the Fourier transform under the heat equation, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) = e^{-Dk^2T}\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\), it is possible to solve for \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\) and apply the inverse Fourier transform to retrieve \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",
