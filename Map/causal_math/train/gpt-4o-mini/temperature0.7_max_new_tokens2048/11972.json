  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant matrix, and z a complex variable. We explore how the function transforms under the action of a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\), where B is another complex constant matrix and C is a closed contour in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is defined at some initial complex point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evaluated at another point \\\\( z = z_1 \\\\) under its own dynamics, will it reflect solely the effects of the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) inherently includes only the dynamics of the matrix A as it maps the complex variable z. There's no intervention or external modification from matrix B involved, hence it will solely reflect the effects of A.",
