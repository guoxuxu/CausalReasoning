  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex scalar. A transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(m\\\\) is a complex scalar.\n\nIf an intervention with another function \\\\(k(z) = z + p\\\\) (where \\\\(p\\\\) is a complex scalar) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be independent of the transformations \\\\(m\\\\) and \\\\(p\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(k(z)\\\\) affect the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). The exponential transformation and the addition of a complex scalar will uniquely alter the path and thus the endpoint, making it dependent on both \\\\(m\\\\) and \\\\(p\\\\).",
