  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nGiven the final transformation result, can we conclusively determine the sequence of functions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) then \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or their combinations) used, by just knowing the output?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the exponential function's periodic nature and the squaring transformation's effect on amplitude and phase, the same output could potentially be obtained from multiple different sequences of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). This ambiguity prevents a definitive back-calculation of the operations or their order.",
