  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a space of functions, with the Fourier transform being used to transform these functions. An operator \\\\(M\\\\) modifies the function using transformation \\\\(Mf(x) = f(x-c)\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a constant. We examine how the spectrum of the functions is affected over the transformation by \\\\(M\\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\(M\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and then the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) of \\\\(Mf(x)\\\\) is taken, does the resulting spectrum shift?",
  "Explanation": "The shift operator \\\\(Mf(x) = f(x-c)\\\\) results in a phase shift in the Fourier spectrum by \\\\(e^{-i\\\\omega c}\\\\). Thus, applying \\\\(M\\\\) before taking the Fourier transform indeed shifts the spectrum, indicating a causal effect of the transformation on the spectral characteristics.",
