  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing a physical system. We utilize a Fourier Transform to analyze frequency components, defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an external force modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), introducing a new frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega_1 \\\\), then does the Fourier Transform solely depend on the natural evolution and not on the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The imposition of an external force that modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\), especially by introducing a new frequency component, will certainly affect the Fourier Transform. The Transform at any time post-intervention will reflect both the natural frequencies of the system as well as the induced components.",
