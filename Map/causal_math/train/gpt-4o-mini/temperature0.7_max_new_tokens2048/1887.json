  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and analyze its effects over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new heat source is introduced as an intervention, changing the system according to a Dirac delta function added at a specific point, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial Fourier transformed condition and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new heat source introduces a significant localized change in the temperature profile, affecting the diffusion process. This makes the final distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) dependent not only on the initial Fourier transformed condition but also significantly on the intervention applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
