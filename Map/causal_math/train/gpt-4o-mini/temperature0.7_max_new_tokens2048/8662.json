  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) evolving over time \\( t \\) with \\( \\omega \\) a real constant. An operation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) transforms \\( z(t) \\) into \\( z'(t) = \\mathcal{T}(z(t)) = z(t) + ce^{dt} \\) where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven \\( z'(T) \\), can we determine the initial function \\( z(0) \\) without knowledge about \\( c \\) and \\( d \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\( z(0) \\) accurately from \\( z'(T) \\) would require knowledge of both \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) since the added exponential term \\( ce^{dT} \\) alters \\( z(T) \\) significantly, masking or modifying the contribution from \\( z(0) = e^{0} \\).",
