  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( T \\\\) applied to the initial conditions over time.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is transformed by matrix \\\\( T \\\\) to become \\\\( T x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by T alters the initial conditions. The new initial state \\\\( T x_0 \\\\) evolves differently unless T commutes with \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\), the matrix exponential of M times t. Generally, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will differ unless T and M have specific relations such as commutativity.",
