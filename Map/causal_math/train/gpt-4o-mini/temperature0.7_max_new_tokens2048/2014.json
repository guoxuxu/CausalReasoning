  "Problem": "Consider the linear integro-differential equation governing a system: \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(x, t) y(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) are known functions. We're investigating the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( y(x) \\\\) and then studying the system's behavior under transformations.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) from the transformed state \\\\( Y(X) \\\\) after time \\\\( t \\\\) without knowing the form of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) or \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) within an integro-differential setup complicates back-calculating to \\\\( y(x) \\\\). The transformation and the evolution distort the pathway from effect to cause, and without precise knowledge of the operational functions, reconstruction of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) is indeterminate.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function p(x) influences the first derivative of y with respect to x, which in turn affects the second derivative of y. The function g(x, t) is integrated with respect to y(t) to produce a term that affects the overall equation governing y(x). The combination of the second derivative of y, p(x), and the integrated term from g(x, t) leads to the determination of y(x). The Fourier transform of y(x) results in Y(X), which can be used to deduce the original function y(x) if the forms of p(x) and g(x, t) are known.",
