  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions describing a signal. The signal undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nWould applying a differentiation operation on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before performing \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) yield the same result as performing \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) first and then multiplying by \\\\(-i\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the properties of the Fourier Transform, differentiating a signal in the time domain corresponds to multiplying its transform by \\\\(-i\\\\omega\\\\) in the frequency domain. Therefore, the order of these operations does not alter the outcome.",
