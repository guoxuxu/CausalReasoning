  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time system represented by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( u(s) \\\\) a varying vector function of time. Study the effect of applying a temporal shift transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\), with \\\\( \\tau \\\\) a time shift constant and \\\\( B \\\\) another matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer the original input function \\\\( u(s) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\) modifies the original input in a way that changes how the output is integrated over time. Without knowledge of whether this shift transformation was applied, it's not possible to unambiguously recover the original form of \\\\( u(s) \\\\) just from observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\).",
