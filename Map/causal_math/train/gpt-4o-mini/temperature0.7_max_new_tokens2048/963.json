  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represents a temporal signal transformed into the complex frequency domain by \\\\( s \\\\). We explore the effects of multiplying \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is a pole.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( s_0 \\\\) the transfer function is modified by adding another function \\\\( G(s) = s+k \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( H(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The original transformation by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the subsequent modification by \\\\( G(s) \\\\) both contribute to altering the behavior of the system in the frequency domain. The resulting time-domain signal, \\\\( y'(t) \\\\), is influenced by the initial signal properties, the pole in \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and the characteristics introduced by \\\\( G(s) \\\\), thereby making \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) dependent on all transformations.",
