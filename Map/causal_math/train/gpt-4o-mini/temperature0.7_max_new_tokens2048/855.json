  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time given by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system is subject to a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAssuming that at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( S(z) = z e^{\\\\mu t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the original dynamics \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and the subsequent intervention \\\\( S(z) \\\\) contribute adjustments to the trajectory and final state. The transformations introduce additional scaling and phase adjustments, dependent on both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\), alongside the original frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The time variable t influences the state z(t), which in turn determines the rate of change dz/dt. The rate of change dz/dt affects the state z, and the state z is transformed by the function T(z) and the intervention S(z). The transformation T(z) is influenced by the constant λ, while the intervention S(z) is influenced by the constant μ. The parameter ω directly affects the rate of change dz/dt.",
