  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Let \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition and \\\\( F(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, represents an integral transformation applied to \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied, reconstructing the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) becomes ambiguous. The potential modification by \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) at t = 0 means the original condition could have been one of multiple possible states depending on the specifics of the exponential matrix \\\\( M \\\\).",
