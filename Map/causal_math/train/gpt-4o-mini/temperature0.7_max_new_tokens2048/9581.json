  "Problem": "Consider a function $z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}$ where $i$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is a real frequency parameter. We analyze the effect of a differential operator $D = \\frac{d}{dt}$ on the function over time $t$, and consider the impact of linear transformations such as $L(z) = az + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers.\n\nIf the linear transformation $L(z)$ is applied to $z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}$ at $t=0$, and then allowed to evolve under the differential operator $D$ without further intervention, will $z(t)$ at $t=T$ be the same as if $e^{i\\omega t}$ was directly evolved to $t=T$ under $D$?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation $L(z) = az + b$ modifies the initial state to be $ae^{i\\omega t} + b$ at $t=0$. When evolved under $D$, the additional term $b$ contributes a constant, substantially changing the trajectory from what would be purely oscillatory behavior to possibly include growth or decay based on the properties of $a$ and $b$. Therefore, $z(t)$ at $t=T$ will not solely reflect the behavior of $e^{i\\omega t}$.",
