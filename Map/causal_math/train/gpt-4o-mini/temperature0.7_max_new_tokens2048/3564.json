  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents temperature distribution in a material and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To test the effect of a spatial transformation, let's apply a rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) to the spatial coordinates.\n\nGiven the distribution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we precisely resolve all actions (including any spatial transformations) applied to the system, from its initial state to time \\\\( T \\\\), by knowing only the final distribution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the thermal diffusion properties being largely smoothing and potentially isotropic, it's particularly challenging to back-calculate any applied spatial transformations from the temperature distribution alone at time \\\\( T \\\\). The transformations could have overlapping effects, enhancing the complexity of unambiguous determination.",
