  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constants. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system, where C is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where D is another constant), is the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 dependent solely on the dynamics defined by A and B, and not by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) introduces a new dynamic element, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interplay of A, B, C, and D. The system's trajectory and endpoint are influenced by both initial and intervened complex exponential transformations, leading to a result that reflects all these factors.",
