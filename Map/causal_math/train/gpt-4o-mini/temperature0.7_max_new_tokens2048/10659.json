  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate how transformations defined by the integral transformation \\\\(T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{\\\\alpha s} f(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with constant \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), affect the function over time t.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(G[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{\\\\beta s} f(s) \\\\, ds\\\\) with a new constant \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final function \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by the original transformation parameters \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of consecutive transformations introduces complex layering of the original function with different exponential terms. The output at any time T > t_1 will therefore be a result of the interactions among \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), reflecting a composite of all transformations rather than just the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
