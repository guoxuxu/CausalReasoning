  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor having capacitance C described by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\\\omega^2 q = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q\\\\) is the charge on the capacitor and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. Investigate the transformation of the system state when subjected to an external sinusoidal voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nIf the voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is applied to the circuit at t = 0 and continues indefinitely, will the charge on the capacitor \\\\(q(t)\\\\) for large t only depend on the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "At steady state, the response of the circuit is controlled by its natural frequency and the driving frequency of the voltage source. In this linear system, the charge \\\\(q(t)\\\\) will oscillate with a frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) matching the sinusoidal source, indicating dependence primarily on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
