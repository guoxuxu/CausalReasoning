  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the current I(t) depends on the applied voltage V(t) through the differential equation \\\\(L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. Analyze different scenarios when mathematical transformations are applied to the voltage by a function \\\\(g(V) = e^{st}V\\\\) representing a scaling of the voltage by an exponential function over time t, where s is a constant.\n\nGiven only the information about the current I(T) at time T, can one determine what transformations were applied to the voltage function, specifically distinguishing between \\\\(g(V)\\\\) and \\\\(h(V)\\\\), or whether both were used?",
  "Explanation": "The terminal current I(T) can potentially be achieved through different series of modifications to the voltage sourced by both \\\\(g(V)\\\\) and \\\\(h(V)\\\\). The overlap in possible dynamical pathways due to the differential nature of the system and the wide range of potential exponential interactions disguises the specific interventions applied.",
