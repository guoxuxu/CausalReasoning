  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nGiven a final Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied, and in what sequence?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) shows the cumulative phase shift, but does not provide information on the sequence or individual contributions of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Both transformations affect the phase spectrum uniformly, and without additional temporal information, the individual and sequential effects cannot be uniquely determined from the final Fourier transform alone.",
