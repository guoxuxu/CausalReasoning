  "Problem": "Investigate the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}w \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are complex constant matrices, considering the integral transformations over a time interval [0, T].\n\nObserving \\\\( w(T) \\\\) after it has evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the subsequent applications of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation through B was applied before A?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant vector \\\\( w(T) \\\\) incorporates transformations influenced by both A and B. Without clarity on whether and how B was applied before A, the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the final observed state.",
