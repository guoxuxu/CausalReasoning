  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, and the effect of a Fourier transform on functions within this space. Specifically, examine the case where \\\\( Lf = -if' \\\\), and the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( f \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nIf known that the function was subjected to the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and then to an adding of a constant \\\\( c \\\\) before Fourier transforming, can we determine the exact original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{Lf}(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\) affects the Fourier transform only at \\\\( k = 0 \\\\). Because the action by L (differentiation) removes any constant component in \\\\( f \\\\), the original function \\\\( f \\\\) can't be uniquely determined if only the transformed derivative is known. At \\\\( k = 0 \\\\), critical information about \\\\( f \\\\)'s baseline level is lost.",
