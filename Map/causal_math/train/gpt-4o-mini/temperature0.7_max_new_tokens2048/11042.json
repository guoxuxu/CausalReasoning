  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analysis is conducted on the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), which transforms the function of time \\\\(u(t)\\\\) into a function of complex variable s.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) at some s after evolving under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\(u_0(t)\\\\) at t = 0 without other information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform can be applied to \\\\(F(s)\\\\) to recover \\\\(u_0(t)\\\\) due to the properties of the Laplace transform being bijective for functions meeting certain conditions like causality and exponential boundedness, which are assumed here.",
