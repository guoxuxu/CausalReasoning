  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system's state is transformed by a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), which modifies the state into its frequency domain representation.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation to the frequency domain occurred, it is challenging to reconstruct \\\\( u_0 \\\\) accurately. The transformation could have altered the state drastically, making it ambiguous to trace back to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without this knowledge.",
