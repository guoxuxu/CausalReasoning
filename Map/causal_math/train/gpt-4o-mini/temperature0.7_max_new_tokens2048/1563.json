  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of resistors, inductors, and capacitors governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\\\alpha \\\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\\\beta v = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. We explore the influence of an input signal transformation defined by \\\\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\\\) where s is a complex constant, investigating its effect over time t.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(v) = e^{kt}v \\\\) (where k is another complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant voltage \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\) and not on s or k?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\( h(v) \\\\) introduces another dimension of change. This adjustment, when combined with the initial transformation and the intrinsic properties of the equation, will most certainly affix the influence of both s and k on the circuit's behavior. Therefore, \\\\( v(T) \\\\) depends on these transformations in addition to the original parameters.",
