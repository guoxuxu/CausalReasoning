  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output signal \\( z(t) \\) is determined by applying a Laplace transform \\( L \\) to an input signal \\( x(t) \\). The transfer function in the Laplace domain is given by \\( H(s) = \\frac{s + a}{s + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\nIf the input signal \\( x(t) \\) is modulated by a function \\( m(t) \\) before applying the Laplace transform, resulting in \\( L(m(t) x(t)) = M(s)X(s) \\), will the overall transformed output \\( Z(s) \\) be affected solely by the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation \\( m(t) \\) changes the original signal \\( x(t) \\) before the Laplace transform is applied, resulting in a modified Laplace domain representation \\( M(s)X(s) \\). Thus, the outcome \\( Z(s) = H(s)M(s)X(s) \\) is influenced by \\( M(s) \\) alongside \\( H(s) \\), affecting the output differently than just \\( H(s)X(s) \\).",
