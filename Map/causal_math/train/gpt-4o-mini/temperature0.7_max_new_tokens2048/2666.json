  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\\\), where k is a positive constant. The system undergoes an analysis involving a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing the system's history?",
  "Explanation": "The linear nature of the decay and the Fourier transform allows exact recovery of the initial condition from the decayed spectrum at any time T. The transform is reversible, preserving information about the initial condition.",
