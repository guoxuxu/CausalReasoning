  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. Examine the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( k(z) \\\\) as an intervention adds another layer of complexity, causing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to depend not only on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also significantly on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). These transformations affect both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), consequently influencing the final outcome.",
