  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\), affects the function and the implications of different transformations.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform without any modifications, will the resulting function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\) have the same poles as if \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) was transformed separately?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)}\\\\), which has a pole at \\\\(s = a+bi\\\\). This is different from the Laplace transform of \\\\(e^{at}\\\\), which is \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\), having a pole at \\\\(s = a\\\\). The presence of \\\\(b\\\\) introduces an imaginary component affecting the pole's location.",
