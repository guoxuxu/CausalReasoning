  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are components following the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effect of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied at t = 0, the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result from multiple possible initial conditions, especially since the matrix C could have nontrivial effects such as rotations and dilations that cannot be simply reversed without knowledge of its form.",
