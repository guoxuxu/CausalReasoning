  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over time t obeys the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. Assume further that a transformation \\\\(g(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u(x,t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant, is applied to study the temperature decay due to radiative loss.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new function \\\\(h(u) = u(x,t) - v(t)\\\\), where \\\\(v(t)\\\\) is an externally controlled cooling effect, is introduced at some time t_1, will the system's state at time T > t_1 only depend on the original heat equation properties and not on the transformation \\\\(g(u)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\(h(u)\\\\) introduces an external cooling that changes the system’s temperature distribution alongside the impacts of \\\\(g(u)\\\\). Therefore, the final state at time T is influenced by both the heat conduction and the compounded effects of the transformation and cooling, making the outcome dependent on \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and the nature of \\\\(v(t)\\\\).",
