  "Problem": "Consider a function represented in the complex plane as \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\), which is transformed by the integral \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{z} dz\\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane that encircles the origin once and t is a parameter.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is transformed to \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at parameter t=0, will \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at t=0 be the same as if the transformation was not applied and the function was directly evaluated?",
  "Explanation": "At t=0, the transformation simplifies to \\\\(e^{zt} = 1\\\\), making the integral \\\\(\\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{1}{z} dz\\\\), which results in 2\\\\pi i. This is equivalent to directly evaluating the integral of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) along C, thus both achieving the same result.",
