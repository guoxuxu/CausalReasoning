  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyse the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}z \\\\, dt \\\\) (where Q is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of transformation through the integral of another matrix exponential. This makes the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on M, N, and Q, as the transformations do not simply add linearly but interact through their respective effects on the trajectory of the complex function.",
