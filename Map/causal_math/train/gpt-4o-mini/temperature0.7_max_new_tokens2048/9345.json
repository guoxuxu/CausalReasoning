  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and its inverse operation.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and evolved based on the transformed heat equation without further modifications, will the inverse-transformed \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for any T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) were directly evolved using the original heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the Fourier and inverse Fourier transformations are exact and lossless, leaving the evolution process unaltered. Therefore, the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) remains consistent with the direct evolution using the heat equation.",
