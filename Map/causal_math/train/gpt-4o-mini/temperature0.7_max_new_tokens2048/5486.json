  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. This system is influenced by transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nCan the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be determined accurately after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The inability to ascertain the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and its potential influence with the unknown factor \\\\( Q \\\\) makes it impossible to reliably infer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely based on the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), particularly given the complex exponential dependency.",
