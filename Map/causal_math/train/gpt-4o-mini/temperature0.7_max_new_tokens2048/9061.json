  "Problem": "We analyze a heat equation \\(\\partial u/\\partial t = \\alpha \\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2\\) for a rod initially subject to a temperature distribution \\(u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) with \\(\\alpha > 0\\). Let's evaluate the effects of applying a Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine component.\n\nIf at \\(t = 0\\), the Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s(u(x, 0)) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) is applied without further transformation, will the temperature distribution \\(u(x, t)\\) at a later time \\(t = T > 0\\) be different from direct evolution under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine components leaves the initial condition unchanged as \\(\\mathcal{F}_s(\\sin(\\pi x)) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\). Therefore, the temperature evolves solely based on the original heat equation, unchanged by the transform.",
