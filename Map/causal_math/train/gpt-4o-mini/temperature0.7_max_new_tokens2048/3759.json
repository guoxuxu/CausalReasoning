  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. This function represents a simple harmonic motion on the complex plane. We examine the effects of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a constant integer, on the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) (where m is another constant integer) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's state at time T > t_1 be solely dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) irrespective of n or m?",
  "Explanation": "The final state depends on both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). After applying \\\\( g \\\\), the function evolves as \\\\( z(t)^{nm} \\\\) for t > t_1, resulting in a state dependent on both n and m, affecting the frequency and amplitude differently than \\\\( \\omega \\\\) alone.",
