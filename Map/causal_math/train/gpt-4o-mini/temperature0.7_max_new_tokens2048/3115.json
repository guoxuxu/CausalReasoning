  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{ct}z_0\\\\) applied on initial complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. The system is further governed by another complex function \\\\(w(z) = e^{dz}w_0\\\\), where \\\\(d\\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\(w_0\\\\) is the initial state of another dependent complex variable.\n\nIf a new complex function \\\\(u(z) = e^{kt}z\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant, is introduced at a certain \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\(w(z(T))\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(d\\\\), disregarding \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\(u(z) = e^{kt}z\\\\) alters the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), therefore affecting the subsequent evaluation of \\\\(w(z)\\\\). The final state \\\\(w(z(T))\\\\) consequentially depends on all constants \\\\(c\\\\), \\\\(d\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\), specifically how they interact through the complex exponential functions in the range \\\\(t_1\\\\) to \\\\(T\\\\).",
