  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents temperature distribution in a material and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To test the effect of a spatial transformation, let's apply a rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) to the spatial coordinates.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, y, 0) \\\\) undergoes a spatial transformation by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) and is then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the distribution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if no spatial transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) modifies the start distribution geometrical configuration, which changes how heat diffuses throughout the structure over time. This rotation can alter isotropy and symmetry properties of the initial condition, leading to a different temperature distribution at any later time.",
