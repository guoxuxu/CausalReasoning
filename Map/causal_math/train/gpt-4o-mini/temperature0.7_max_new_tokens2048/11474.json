  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) as a signal through a linear system described by the transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-ix}z(x)dx \\\\). We explore the causal inference ability by analyzing the system's response using advanced calculus and integral transformations.\n\nGiven the output from the system, \\\\( T(z) \\\\), can one infer the exact function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such as \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), assuming no knowledge of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple functions could theoretically yield the same result under the integral transformation due to properties of the Fourier transform and orthogonality in function space, making it impossible to conclusively determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
