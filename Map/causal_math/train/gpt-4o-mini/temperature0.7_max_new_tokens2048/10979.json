  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are functions of time, t, subject to a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) with constant matrices A and B. The function z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = Dz + E \\\\) is applied as an intervention, where D and E are constant matrices, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the matrices A, B, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( U(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further alters the state to a new value modified by D and E, and the resulting state evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) also depends on the initial application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\). Therefore, the final state at T depends on A, B, C, and the subsequent intervention parameters D and E.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The variable x(t) and y(t) both contribute to the formation of z(t). The variable z(t) is transformed by the linear transformation T(z) to produce an output that is dependent on the matrices A and B. The evolution of z(t) is governed by the differential equation represented by \\\\dot{z}, which relies on the matrix C. At time t_1, the intervention U(z) modifies z(t) through the constants D and E. After applying U(z), the state z(T) for T > t_1 will be influenced by this new transformation, making it dependent on D and E, unlike the previous transformations which relied on A, B, and C.",
