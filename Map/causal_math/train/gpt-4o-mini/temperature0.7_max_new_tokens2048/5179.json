  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), where \\( t \\) is time. We evaluate the integration of this function transformed by a differential operator \\( D \\) such that \\( Dz = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}z \\), for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new operator \\( E \\) defined by \\( Ez = \\frac{d^m}{dt^m}z \\), where \\( m = 3 \\), is applied as an intervention, will the function \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be solely dependent on \\( t \\) and not on the actions of \\( D \\) or \\( E \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( E \\) alters the state further by transforming \\( z \\) into a higher derivative (third derivative in this case). Thus, \\( z(T) \\) will depend on both \\( D \\), \\( E \\) (the first and third derivatives) and how these derivatives interact over the interval from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\).",
