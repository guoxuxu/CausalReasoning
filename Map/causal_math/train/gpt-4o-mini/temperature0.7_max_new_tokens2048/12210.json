  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at t = t_1 a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the transformations A and B but not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) imports another level of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on C and D in addition to A and B. The influence of both C and D through the transformations affects the trajectory and the eventual state at time T.",
