  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BdW \\\\), where \\\\( W(t) \\\\) is a standard Brownian motion and A, B are matrices. Let's analyze the influence of a deterministic control policy \\\\( u(t) = Ce^{Dt}X(t) \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices integrated over a time interval.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T, can it be determined whether the policy \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was applied at any time on the interval or not by just observing \\\\( X(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of the deterministic matrices A, C, D and the stochastic term \\\\( BdW \\\\), multiple trajectories could result in the same final state. Hence, detecting specific interventions from the final state alone is not feasible due to the combination of deterministic and stochastic influences.",
