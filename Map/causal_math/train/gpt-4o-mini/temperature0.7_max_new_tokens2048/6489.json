  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + i v(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), respectively. We aim to explore the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is calculated and then the inverse Laplace Transform is applied, will the resulting function match \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform and its inverse are theoretically perfect operations for reconstructing a function when all conditions for the transforms are met (such as function being piecewise continuous and of exponential order). Thus, applying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) followed by its inverse will exactly reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
