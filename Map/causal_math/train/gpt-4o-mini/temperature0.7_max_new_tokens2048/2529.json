  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} f(s) ds \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to operate under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the transformed signal \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time T mimic the original signal behavior of z(t) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) fundamentally changes the signal characteristics. The operation of \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) causes the resultant integral to introduce phase shifts and amplitude modifications, leading to a signal that differs from the original \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
