  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We review the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), and how it translates to solve the equation in the transformed domain.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the system's state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the intervention with \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) as an intervention can alter the evolution dictated by \\\\( L \\\\). The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( L \\\\) and the effects of the new operator \\\\( M \\\\), reflecting the compounded influence of both operations.",
