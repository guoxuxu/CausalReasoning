  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) applied to the components \\\\( (x, y) \\\\) of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the system evolves under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if the initial conditions \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) had been directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( M \\\\) alters the initial conditions, which in turn changes the evolution of the system. Since the system's behavior is linearly dependent on the initial conditions and the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ from the trajectory starting from untransformed initial conditions.",
