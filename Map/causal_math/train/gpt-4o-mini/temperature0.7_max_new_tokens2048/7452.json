  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) according to the integral transformation \\\\( V(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)/RC} I(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where R and C are constants representing the resistance and capacitance, respectively.\n\nBy knowing the output voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) and the times of intervention, can we accurately deduce the exact changes made to \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at those interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The output voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) is a result of a complex integration over the entire history of input currents adjusted by the exponential decay factor, making it difficult to exactly pinpoint the nature and extent of changes made to \\\\( I(t) \\\\) merely based on the final output voltage. There are potentially many different input histories that could result in the same output due to the mathematical properties of integral transformations.",
