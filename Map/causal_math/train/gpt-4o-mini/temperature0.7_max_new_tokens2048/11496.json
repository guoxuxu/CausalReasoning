  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{Aw} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and w is a complex variable. Suppose we perform an integral transformation on z(w) given by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sw}z(w) dw \\\\), where s is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the resultant output \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\), can we specifically identify whether the original function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) or the intervened function \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was used throughout, only based on the endpoint value of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) might not clearly differentiate if \\\\( e^{Aw} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{Cw}e^{Aw} \\\\) (from the intervention) was applied due to overlaps in potential effects caused by A and C in the exponential terms. The complex integration involving s can further obscure the precise contributions of either function to the endpoint.",
