  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real number representing frequency. Evaluate the transformation by applying the Laplace transform to z(t).\n\nIf a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is introduced into the function after applying the Laplace transform, influencing the dynamics, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\alpha z(t) \\\\) differ from simply scaling the output Laplace transform by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform's linearity dictates that transforming \\\\( \\\\alpha z(t) \\\\) and scaling \\\\( L{z(t)} \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) will yield identical results. Such an intervention, despite altering system dynamics, aligns with the properties of linearity of Laplace transforms.",
