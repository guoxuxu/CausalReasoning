  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\( \\\\Delta T \\\\) in a body is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We examine the effect of an external heating process described by \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}\\\\Delta T_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature difference.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another external cooling process \\\\( c(t) = e^{-Ct}\\\\Delta T \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final temperature difference \\\\( \\\\Delta T(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the natural cooling constant k and not on A or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( c(t) \\\\) introduces an additional external factor, making the final state \\\\( \\\\Delta T(T) \\\\) dependent on the constants A, C, and k. The interplay between the exponential heating and cooling adjustments affects the trajectory and final state of the temperature difference.",
