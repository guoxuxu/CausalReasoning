  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We study the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the transformation via \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could have altered the initial states of x and y. The presence of non-commuting matrices A, B, and C complicates backward determination of the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

The function g(z) transforms z into a new form, which can also lead back to z_0. The functions x(t) and y(t) contribute to the formation of z(t), while the matrices A and B govern the dynamics of x and y, respectively. The constant matrix C is involved in the transformation g(z) and has a direct role in the relationship between g(z) and z(t).",
