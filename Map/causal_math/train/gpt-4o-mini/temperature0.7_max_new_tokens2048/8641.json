  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We evaluate how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the equation evolves under its original dynamics up to time T, is the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under the original differential equation without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) changes the initial state by scaling it, which affects its future trajectory under the dynamics of \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). The scaling due to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) introduces an exponential growth or decay, modifying \\\\( z(T) \\\\) compared to its natural evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
