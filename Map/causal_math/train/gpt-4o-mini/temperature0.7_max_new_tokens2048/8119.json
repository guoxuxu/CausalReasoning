  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing the motion of a particle in a plane, influenced by the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf an intervention altering the phase by multiplying by \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still be predictable solely based on the initial dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new phase factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) alters the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting the subsequent evolution. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the initial dynamics and the nature of the intervention, so it's not solely predictable from the initial conditions.",
