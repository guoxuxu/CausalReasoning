  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = c e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), transforming it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nWill the Fourier transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be affected if the function is altered by a constant phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) before applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), compared to applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) directly to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without the phase shift?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a phase shift to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before the Fourier transform modifies the phase of the resulting transform. The original and the phase-shifted functions will have transforms that differ by a phase factor, thus affecting the result of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\).",
