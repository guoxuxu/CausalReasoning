  "Problem": "Consider the influence of an external magnetic field B on a particle with charge q and the trajectory described by the vector position function \\\\( r(t) \\). Assume the magnetic field introduces a force per unit charge represented by the vector function \\\\( F(t) = qv(t) \\\\times B \\), where \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is the velocity vector of the particle at time t and \\\\times denotes the cross product.\n\nIf at time t_1 a force \\\\( F_1 = -qv(t_1) \\\\times B \\\\) equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the magnetic force is applied, will the pathway of the particle from t_1 onwards be identical to its path had there been no field from the start?",
  "Explanation": "The applied opposing force at t_1 cancels the magnetic force exactly, eliminating its influence and allowing the particle to continue as though it were in free motion from that point forward, identical to its initial unaltered trajectory.",
