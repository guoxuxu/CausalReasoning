  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real scalar and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex number value. We apply continuous linear transformations \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex number, to this function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(g(z) = dz\\\\) (where \\\\(d\\\\) is another complex number) is applied, will the final state of the system at \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be independent of the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) will depend on both transformations. The transformations \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) and \\\\(g(z) = dz\\\\) alter the trajectory of the state at different times, resulting in a final state that is a product of both transformations and the natural evolution, indicated by \\\\(dc e^{iAT}z_0\\\\).",
