  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\), where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of implementing a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) on x(t) and then applying an inverse Fourier transform to observe the effects on the evolution of x(t) over time.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) is applied to \\( x(t) \\) at t = 0, followed by an immediate inverse Fourier transform, and then \\( x(t) \\) is evolved under \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform followed by an immediate inverse Fourier transform restores the function to its original form. The state of \\( x(t) \\) remains unchanged initially, thus the evolution under \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\) will proceed as if no transformation was applied.",
