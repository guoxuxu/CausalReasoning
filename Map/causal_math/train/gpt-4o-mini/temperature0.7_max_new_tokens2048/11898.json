  "Problem": "Consider a complex function in the form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) where x is a constant complex vector and A is a constant real matrix. We assess the behavior of the function after applying a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an external vector function \\\\( y = e^{-Bt}w \\\\) (where B is a constant matrix and w a constant vector) is added, will the resulting transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s > 0 purely depend on A and ignore the effects of B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( y = e^{-Bt}w \\\\) introduces an additional term to z(t), which affects the overall Laplace transform. The resulting transform function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will depend both on A and B due to the additive nature of the functions in the time domain affecting the frequency domain representation.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function z(t) is influenced by the constant real matrix A and the constant complex vector x, while the external vector function y is impacted by the constant matrix B and the constant vector w. The Laplace transform Z(s) of z(t) is derived from z(t), indicating that Z(s) is primarily influenced by A, but the introduction of y shows that the effects of B may also play a role.",
