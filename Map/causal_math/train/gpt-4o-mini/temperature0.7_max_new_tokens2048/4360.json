  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the influence of the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at some endpoint \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(-t) \\\\) or no transformation), based strictly on the observed value of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) can manifest similar characteristics for either direct evolution or an intervention like \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(-t) \\\\), particularly when the base function is symmetric or when frequency components overlap. This ambiguity prevents unique determination of prior interventions.",
