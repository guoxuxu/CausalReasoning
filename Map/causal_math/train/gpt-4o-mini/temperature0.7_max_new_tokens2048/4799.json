  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{j\\omega t} x(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) is a time-dependent input signal and \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. The dynamics of \\( x(t) \\) in the system are described by a complex function \\( x(t+1) = L x(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear transformation.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( q(t) = e^{j\\theta t}x(t) \\) (where \\( \\theta \\) is a constant phase shift) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( L \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\theta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( q(t) \\) introduces an additional phase shift, thereby influencing the future states of the signal \\( z(T) \\). Therefore, the final state depends on \\( \\omega \\) (from the initial transformation), \\( \\theta \\) (from the intervention), and \\( L \\) (dynamics of the system). The combined effect of these factors determines the trajectory and the final state of \\( z(T) \\).",
