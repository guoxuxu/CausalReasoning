  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the changes in the output when a transformation defined by \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) by observing \\( y(t) = g(z(t)) \\) without knowing the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t z(s) \\, ds \\), the derivative \\( \\dot{y}(t) = z(t) \\) allows reconstruction of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). The unique antiderivative nature of the exponential function coupled with its frequency component allows the original function to be recovered from its integral.",
