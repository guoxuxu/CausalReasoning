  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effects of modifying the system with a transformation represented by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nAssuming a function \\\\( j(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( j(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, causing the final state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) to rely on D, F, and M. These combined effects of the transformations can alter the system's trajectory such that the endpoint relies on all matrices involved.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly influences the state x, while the transformation h(x) modifies x and impacts the final state x(T). The function j(x) also influences x(T) through its application at time t1. Therefore, both M and j(x) affect the final state x(T), indicating that x(T) does not depend solely on M.",
