  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the function V(x), and governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\). We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(x)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\xi x} x(t) dt \\\\) on the trajectory of the particle.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), after knowing that an external potential U was introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely whether a Fourier transformation was applied at t = 0 only by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the initial Fourier transformation and the introduction of a new potential U makes it difficult to uniquely ascertain the influence of the Fourier transformation alone. Both actions modify trajectories in ways that are complex to disentangle by observing the endpoint alone.",
