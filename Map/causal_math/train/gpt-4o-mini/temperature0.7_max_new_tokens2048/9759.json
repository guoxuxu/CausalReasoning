  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention in the form of a different transformation \\( G(u) \\) is applied, will the end state \\( u(x, T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original heat equation and not on the Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) or the intervention \\( G(u) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\( G(u) \\) as an intervention adds another degree of manipulation to the system. The final state \\( u(x, T) \\) becomes dependent not only on the evolution of the heat equation but also on how the original \\( F(u) \\) and the intervention \\( G(u) \\) interact with the dynamics of the system, potentially altering the trajectory and the final state.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, t) evolves over time based on its time derivative u_t, which is influenced by the Laplacian Δu. The Fourier transform F(u) modifies the function u(x, t), while the intervention G(u) also applies to u(x, t) at time t_1 and affects the state at a later time T. Therefore, the end state u(x, T) is influenced by both the intervention G(u) and the original heat equation.",
