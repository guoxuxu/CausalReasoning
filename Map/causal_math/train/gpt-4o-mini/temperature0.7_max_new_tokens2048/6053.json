  "Problem": "Consider a system which can be modeled by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), shifting through complex numbers in a unit circle over time. An external transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = 1\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and the system is then left to evolve according to \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be on the unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) will scale the magnitude of \\\\(z_0\\\\) by \\\\(|c|\\\\). Unless \\\\(|c| = 1\\\\), the resultant trajectory will not stay on the unit circle, since \\\\(z(T) = c e^{iT}\\\\), and \\\\(|ce^{iT}| = |c|\\\\).",
