  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), where \\( t \\) is time. We evaluate the integration of this function transformed by a differential operator \\( D \\) such that \\( Dz = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}z \\), for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nGiven the outcome \\( Dz(t) \\) for \\( n = 2 \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we infer the original function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Having the second derivative \\( Dz(t) = -e^{it} \\) does not provide enough information to completely reconstruct the original function \\( z(t) \\) without initial state information, as multiple functions could exhibit the same second derivative over time.",
