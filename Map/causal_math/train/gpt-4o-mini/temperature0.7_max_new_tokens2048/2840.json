  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nKnowing the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) after the intervention, can we determine precisely which intervention was applied (whether \\\\( G(x) \\\\) was used, or a different one)?",
  "Explanation": "Different interventions could result in similar spectrum modifications, especially if they are linear and additive. Without additional information on the specifics of the function modifications or the nature of these interventions, it’s not possible to pinpoint which intervention was used based solely on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
