  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The impact of Laplace transformation on this system is analyzed by transforming \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) separately.\n\nGiven new Laplace transformed outputs \\\\( X'(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\), can the original scaling function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) applied to both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be determined uniquely?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations to the Laplace domain introduce complexities such as convolution effects and shifting poles/zeros which can obscure direct inference of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), especially if its effects are not uniquely distinguishable from inherent dynamics governed by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",
