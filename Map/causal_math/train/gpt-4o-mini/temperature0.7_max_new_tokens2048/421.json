  "Problem": "Given a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( x \\\\) is a spatial variable. The function is initially defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = (K * f)(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f \\\\) is an initial function. We study how the transformation evolves under the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( (K * f)(x) \\\\) and evolved according to \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t=T \\\\) be affected by the specific choice of the kernel function \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The kernel function \\\\( K \\\\) initially transforms the function \\\\( f \\\\), altering the starting configuration of \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). Because the transformation by \\\\( K \\\\) affects the initial value condition of the PDE, it influences how the function diffuses over time, impacting the profile of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\).",
