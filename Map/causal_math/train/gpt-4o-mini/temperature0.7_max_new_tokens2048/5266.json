  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\), where L is a differential operator. Consider how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system's behavior.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if any transformations or interventions were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is invertible and retains all necessary information about the function, the initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) can be reconstructed from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) irrespective of how the solution was evolved, provided no additional transformations are applied.",
