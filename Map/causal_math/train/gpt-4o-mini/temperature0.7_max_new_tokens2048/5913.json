  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical system where the rotation of a vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\) is defined by a complex function \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant representing angular velocity. The impact of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\), defined as scaling by a factor \\\\(s>0\\\\), is used as an intervention.\n\nIf the rotation function \\\\(f(t, v)\\\\) is applied to vector \\\\(v_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t=0\\\\) and allowed to evolve naturally until time \\\\(t=T\\\\), will the final position of the vector be the same as if it were directly subjected to rotation for the same period without initial application of \\\\(f\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of applying \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\) directly from the beginning and allowing it to evolve naturally is consistent with applying it at any initial time as the function describes a pure rotation with a constant angular velocity, leading to the same end position at time \\\\(T\\\\).",
