  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the system under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix performing a linear transformation.\n\nCan we recover the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) was initially applied, it is impossible to ascertain whether the state observed at t = T originated from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). Lack of this critical information about initial transformation hinders proper backtracking to \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
