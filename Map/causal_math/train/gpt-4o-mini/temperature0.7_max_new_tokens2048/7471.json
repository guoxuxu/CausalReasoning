  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\), which converts it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf during the interval of transformation, a modulation by \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\beta \\\\) is another constant) is introduced, will the dominant frequency component of the Fourier transform still be at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\) acts as an additional periodic modulation, shifting the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) by \\\\( \\beta \\\\) due to the properties of frequency modulation in Fourier analysis, resulting in a dominant component at \\\\( \\omega + \\beta \\\\).",
