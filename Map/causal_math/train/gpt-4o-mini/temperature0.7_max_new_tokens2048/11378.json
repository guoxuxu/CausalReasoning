  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform on this function.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with no additional data, can we reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is known and is a proper Laplace transform of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), then the inverse Laplace transform can be used systematically to retrieve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) accurately, assuming all the necessary conditions for convergence are satisfied.",
