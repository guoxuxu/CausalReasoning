  "Problem": "Consider a controlled linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and B is the control input matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation of the states defined by the operator \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we reverse engineer the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T assuming no control inputs were applied, without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation on the application of the integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\), and considering its modification of state dynamics, it is not feasible to uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\). It is due to the added complexity and effect of M in the integral transformation.",
