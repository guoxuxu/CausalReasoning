  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We will study the changes in the function with respect to the integration operator over time defined as \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), and analyze the influence of modifications by derivative with respect to time.\n\nGiven the final value \\\\( F(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine if the intervention (application of g(t)) took place, and at what time it was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( F(T) \\\\), it is not possible to determine uniquely whether the intervention occurred, much less the specific time of its application. The intervention could result in various modifications of the integral result depending on its time and nature, and other function parameters or interventions could equivalently result in the same \\\\( F(T) \\\\).",
