  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) describing heat distribution along a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) with constant diffusivity k. Investigate the implications of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x, t)e^{-i\\\\omega x}dx \\\\) applied to this model.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) knowing it evolved according to the Fourier-transformed heat equation without knowing the exact form of Fourier transform applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) relies critically on knowledge of the Fourier transform applied at t = 0. Without this, the transformation does not uniquely determine the initial state because multiple initial conditions can lead to similar transformed states over time due to diffusion effects.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The heat distribution u(x, t) evolves over time as described by its rate of change with respect to time, which is influenced by the spatial distribution of heat as described by its second spatial derivative. The Fourier transform of the heat distribution, denoted as hat{u}(ω, t), is dependent on the time derivative of u(x, t). The state of hat{u}(ω, t) at time T can be used to reconstruct the initial condition u(x, 0) from its value at time 0. Additionally, the initial condition reconstruction relies on the value of hat{u}(ω, 0).",
