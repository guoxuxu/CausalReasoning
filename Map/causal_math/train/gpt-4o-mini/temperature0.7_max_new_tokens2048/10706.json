  "Problem": "Consider a closed loop feedback system where the output function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\\\) involving a Laplace transform variable 's'. We evaluate the introduction of a disturbance function \\\\( d(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real number, affecting the output.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time t, is it possible to conclusively trace back to determine whether the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) was introduced, without prior knowledge of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represents a convolution with the disturbance, and without the specific value of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), it is impossible to disentangle the components contributed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone from those altered by \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), the spectral characteristics influenced by the disturbance can't be uniquely determined.",
