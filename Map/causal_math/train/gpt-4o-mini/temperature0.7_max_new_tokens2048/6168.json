  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which represents a unit circle parametrized by time t. Analyze how the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), is influenced by the introduction of a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) in the function, defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\).\n\nBy observing the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some point s, can we conclusively identify all phase shifts (initial shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and any intervention shift \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\)) that were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, even when observed at a specific value, encompasses effects from all applied phase shifts, but it does not individually distinguish the times or magnitudes of those shifts without additional temporal information or constraints.",
