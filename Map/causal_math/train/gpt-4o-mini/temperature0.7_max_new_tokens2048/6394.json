  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\), involving a complex matrix F, is applied at different instances.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), any inference about \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could be inaccurate as the transformation \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) which could have been applied may involve complex rotation and scaling, leading to multiple potential initial states that could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
