  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) satisfy the system of differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\). The system is subjected to a Fourier transform defined as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), where \\( Z(s) \\) is the transformed function in the complex s-domain.\n\nGiven \\( Z(s) \\) for a specific \\( s \\), can we uniquely determine \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) just from \\( Z(s) \\) without additional information about the coefficients \\( A, B, C, \\) and \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformations involved in obtaining \\( Z(s) \\) from \\( z(t) \\) are not typically invertible uniquely without knowing the relationship between \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) imposed by the coefficients. The transformation loses information about individual trajectories of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) over time, which are essential to calculate initial conditions.",
