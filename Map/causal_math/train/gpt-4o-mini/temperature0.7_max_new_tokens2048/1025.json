  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real function of time t and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\), with A being a real constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T be affected by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) does not directly depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but the transformation to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) introduces a dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Although the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) itself follows its natural dynamics independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the observed output in the form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is directly influenced by the angular frequency, affecting the apparent behavior and phase of the outcome.",
