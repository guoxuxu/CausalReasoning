  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, complex matrix, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We analyze how the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a constant matrix, changes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine whether the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) does not change the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) which matches \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) indicates that the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) did indeed have no effect when applied; this can be concluded directly.",
