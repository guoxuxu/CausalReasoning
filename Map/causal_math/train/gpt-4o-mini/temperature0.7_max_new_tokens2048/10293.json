  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s) u(s, t) ds \\\\) on the solution u(x, t), with K being a kernel function.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) undergoes the transform \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), will the form of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > 0 be equivalent to that obtained by evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under \\\\( Lu \\\\) without the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( T(u) \\\\) changes the initial condition effectively and alters how the solution evolves under the operator L. Depending on the properties of K and how it interacts with L, the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) may be significantly different.",
