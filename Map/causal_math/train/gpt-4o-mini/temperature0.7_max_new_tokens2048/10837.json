  "Problem": "Consider the complex plane where functions are mapped using a transformation \\\\( z' = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) indicates time. Analyze the impact of this transformation under the integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), reflecting a periodic adjustment over time T.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z' = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and this mapping is continued without intervention up to time T, does the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( z' \\\\) is consistently applied, the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is a deterministic function of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given that these parameters dictate the oscillation rate and extent without alteration from external actions.",
