  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a constant complex vector. We are interested in evaluating the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally without any transformation, will its state at time T be different after application of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves as \\\\( e^{iAt} w \\\\) irrespective of the transformation until an explicit application of \\\\( I(z) \\\\). The natural evolution path remains unchanged by the definition of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) until it’s applied.",
