  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the equation of motion is derived from the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + v(x) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is momentum, \\\\( m \\\\) is mass, and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is a potential energy function. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to the position function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + \\\\delta x \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta x \\\\) is a small perturbation) is applied as an intervention, will the waveform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend on the initial Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(0)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state of the system by a definable perturbation \\\\( \\\\delta x \\\\), affecting the trajectory and consequently the state at any time T. Thus, the Fourier Transform at time T will depend both on the initial conditions and the intervention.",
