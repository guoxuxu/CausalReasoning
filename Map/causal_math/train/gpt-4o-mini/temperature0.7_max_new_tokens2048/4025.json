  "Problem": "In a control system, the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant system represented by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = H(s)X(s) \\), where \\( H(s) \\) is the transfer function and \\( X(s) \\) is the input in the s-domain. Consider the effect of an additive control intervention \\( u(t) \\) on the system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( U(s) \\). The modified system output is \\( Y(s) = H(s)(X(s) + U(s)) \\).\n\nIf \\( X(s) \\) is set, and the system evolves without any control intervention \\( u(t) \\), will \\( Y(s) \\) at a later time \\( T \\) be equal to \\( H(s)X(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, the system output \\( Y(s) \\) is governed solely by \\( X(s) \\) and the system's transfer function \\( H(s) \\). Therefore, the output will be exactly \\( H(s)X(s) \\), as the intervention \\( U(s) \\) is zero.",
