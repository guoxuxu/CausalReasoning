  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the heat diffusion over a plane is studied. The temperature distribution is represented by the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), which satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. The experiment manipulates this distribution via a sudden localized heating at point \\\\( x_0 \\\\), represented by the function \\\\( \\\\delta(x - x_0) \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a cooling process represented by a function \\\\( \\\\gamma(x - x_1) \\\\) is introduced, does the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the heat diffusion equation and not on the earlier heating at \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The cooling intervention at \\\\( x_1 \\\\) does not negate the previous heating at \\\\( x_0 \\\\); thus, the final temperature distribution relies on both the effects of the initial heating and the subsequent cooling, as well as the properties of the heat diffusion equation. The localized effects and the subsequent spread can create complex interactions in the temperature field.",
