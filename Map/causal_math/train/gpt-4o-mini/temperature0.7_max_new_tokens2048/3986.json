  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(w) \\) mapping complex numbers where \\( z(w) \\) is defined as \\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega w} \\), with \\( \\omega \\) being a real constant. We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( Z(v) \\) on \\( z(w) \\), defined by \\( Z(v) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(w) e^{-ivw} dw \\).\n\nCan we uniquely determine \\( \\omega \\) from \\( Z(v) \\) without additional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( Z(v) \\), which is a Fourier transform, results in \\( 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - v) \\). This clearly identifies \\( \\omega \\) as the singular spike in the frequency domain identifies the dominant frequency component of \\( z(w) \\).",
