  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by Laplace Transformations, where an initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}\\\\), and an intervention involves multiplication by the function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer.\n\nGiven \\\\( G(s) \\\\) resulting from a direct transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we uniquely ascertain the initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) without considering other possible functions?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) suggests the original function could be \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), other functions, e.g., combinations involving delta functions or other exponentials multiplied by certain factors, might also yield the same transform. Without additional details, the original function isn’t uniquely determined.",
