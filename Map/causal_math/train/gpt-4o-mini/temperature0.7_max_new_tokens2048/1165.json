  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the complex initial condition. We evaluate how the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant, affects the evolution over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and it then evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T equal \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\) as if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition, resulting in a new starting point \\\\( z(0) = e^{D \\\\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) but as it evolves, its trajectory changes due to the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) depending on \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Therefore, the trajectory and final state at time T are altered.",
