  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = My\\\\), and M is a constant matrix. We study the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt}y \\\\) applied at different instances, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( y_0 \\\\) be inferred exactly from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether \\\\( h(y) \\\\) was applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( h(y) \\\\) might have been applied, altering the trajectory of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and hence \\\\( z(t) \\\\), knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not allow us to uniquely deduce \\\\( y_0 \\\\) unless we know about the application of \\\\( h(y) \\\\). The uncertainty in the trajectory due to potential application of \\\\( h(y) \\\\) obscures the original condition.",
