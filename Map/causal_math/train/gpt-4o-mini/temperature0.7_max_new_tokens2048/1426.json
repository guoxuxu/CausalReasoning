  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We are interested in how the application of a Fourier transform affects this function and the consequences of its application on the behavior of the system.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) resulting from \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible for functions like \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), which allows for the precise reconstruction of the original function from its frequency domain representation, \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\).",
