  "Problem": "Consider two complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(t)\\\\) where \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and \\\\(w(t) = \\\\log(t)\\\\). The scenario examines the relationship between these functions under different operations and transformations such as differentiation and integration in the complex plane.\n\nCan the behavior or state of \\\\(w(t)\\\\) at a given t > 0 be derived or affected by the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at the same t value, without any composite functional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The states of \\\\(w(t)\\\\) and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) are independent in their fundamental definitions; \\\\(w(t)\\\\)'s value at any time is strictly derived from \\\\(\\\\log(t)\\\\) and is unaffected by \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), which operates over a different domain (circular motion in the complex plane) and has a different mathematical nature.",
