  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a scalar field, and \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant vector. We investigate the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the resulting function is then allowed to evolve according to the equation without further transformations, will the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if the equation evolved normally?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition alters the representation of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to the frequency domain. The resulting evolution in the spatial domain is affected by this transformation, and would differ from the evolution of the original \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) due to the change in initial conditions after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).",
