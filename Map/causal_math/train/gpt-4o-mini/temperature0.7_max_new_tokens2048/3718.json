  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a divergence-free condition. Study the effect of introducing a scalar field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) = T(x)e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), where T(x) represents a temperature distribution and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a growth rate, on heat transfer characteristics of the flow.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( \\\\theta(x, T) \\\\) at a time T, can we accurately deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( T(x) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing the details of the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The changes in the temperature distribution due to advection and diffusion effects caused by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) make it infeasible to retrieve the exact initial distribution without knowledge of the flow influences and parameters.",
