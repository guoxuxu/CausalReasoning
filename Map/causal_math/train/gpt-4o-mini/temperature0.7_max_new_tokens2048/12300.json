  "Problem": "In a control system analysis, the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) acts on a state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. We explore the changes in state space when applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) at different points in time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t=0 and the system is left to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) until t=T, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) modifies the initial state, changing the system’s trajectory from the outset. Unless C and D are proportional such that their exponentials commute effectively, the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will diverge due to the multiplicative impact of matrix exponential dynamics.",
