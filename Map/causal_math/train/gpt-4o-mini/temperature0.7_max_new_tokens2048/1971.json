  "Problem": "Investigate the interaction of a discrete dynamic system characterized by the linear mapping equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), in which M is a constant matrix. Consider the transformation induced by the function \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix that acts at a specific moment.\n\nAssuming a second function \\\\( h(x) = Ex \\\\) (where E is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\( n = k \\) where \\( k < N \\), does the end state at \\( n = N \\) only depend on M and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The state evolution depends on all transformations applied. Though the system evolves primarily under M, interventions \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) = Ex \\\\) modify it, affecting the final state at \\( n = N \\). Therefore, the end state depends on M, D, and E and their interactions.",
