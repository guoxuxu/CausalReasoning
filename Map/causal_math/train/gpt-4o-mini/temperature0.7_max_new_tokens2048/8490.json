  "Problem": "Assume that a function \\\\( h: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) is defined as \\\\( h(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We investigate the effects of this transformation on complex-valued functions and their corresponding Fourier Transforms.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\xi) \\\\) of the modified function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az}g(z) \\\\), can we infer what the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was without knowing \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) in the transformation \\\\( e^{az} \\\\), retrieving the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\xi) \\\\) is ambiguous. The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) crucially influences the shifting and scaling in the Fourier domain, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without it.",
