  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane over time t. Analyze the transformations applied by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and the implications of these transformations over time.\n\nIf we observe the evolution of the system to be \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), can we conclude that the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) was not applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) suggests a typical evolution of the original system without any transformations. Since applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the system's evolution to \\\\( e^{2it} \\\\), observing \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) indicates that the transformation was not applied.",
