  "Problem": "Consider a closed loop feedback system where the output function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\\\) involving a Laplace transform variable 's'. We evaluate the introduction of a disturbance function \\\\( d(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real number, affecting the output.\n\nIf the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) is introduced into the system at t = 0, and the output evolves governed only by \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the final output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time t be solely governed by the original transfer function H(s) without the inclusion of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the disturbance \\\\( d(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) modifies the input to the system, which then alters the output through the transfer function. The new output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will not only depend on \\\\( H(s) \\\\) but will have contributions resulting from the convolution of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), affecting the system dynamics overall.",
