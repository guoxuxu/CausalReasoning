  "Problem": "Consider the application of a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We analyze the impact of this transformation over time when the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is combined with another transformed function under different scenarios.\n\nIf an operation such as differentiation is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, will the resulting \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) still directly reflect the original characteristics of \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening operations like differentiation alter the original function, which affects the Fourier transform result. Differentiation changes \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to a new function whose transform will reflect these changes, thus modifying the original characteristics in \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
