  "Problem": "Consider the evaluation of the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\\\cos(tx) \\\\, dx \\\\) changing the variable x through the transformation \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants and analyzing the impact on the function's behaviour.\n\nKnowing the final integral result after several interventions, including shifting and scaling by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), and changing the function form, can we determine what specific transformations were made?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome from the integral transformation after multiple interventions is influenced by each step's specifics, which can cause similar effects in the integral's value. Given the multiplicity and variability in how each parameter can affect the result, determining the exact transformations from the integral's final value is implausible.",
