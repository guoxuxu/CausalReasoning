  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) operating in the complex plane. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this function, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier spectrum with a peak at an arbitrary \\\\( \\\\omega = c \\\\), can we definitively determine the specific values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in the intervened function \\\\( z'(x) = \\\\exp(i(ax+b)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the peak at \\\\( \\\\omega = c \\\\) confirms that the frequency of the original function was adjusted to \\\\( c \\\\), it does not provide any information about the phase shift \\\\( b \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) might produce the same frequency \\\\( c \\\\) without revealing specific values.",
