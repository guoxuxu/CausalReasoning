  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an inductor L and resistor R in series connected to an alternating voltage source given by \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The voltage across the inductor is described by the equation \\\\( V_L = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} \\\\) and the resistor by \\\\( V_R = RI \\\\). We study the effect of altering the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the source on the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) in the circuit.\n\nFrom observing a decrease in the current amplitude \\\\(I(t)\\\\), can we definitively infer that there was an increase in the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the voltage source?",
  "Explanation": "While an increase in frequency can cause a reduction in current amplitude due to increased impedance, other factors such as changes in resistance, or even a reduction in the source voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\), might also lead to a similar effect. Therefore, decrease in current doesn't uniquely imply an increase in frequency.",
