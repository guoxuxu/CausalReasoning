  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) applied over time t, with C being another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at t = 0 modifies both x and y components of z, thus altering the trajectory from the initial conditions. Since C can affect each component differently, this typically leads to a distinct endpoint at time T.",
