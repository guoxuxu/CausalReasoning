  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex constant vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to this function over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modulation by \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another real constant) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as an intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be independent of \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces an additional frequency component to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) reflected in its transform. The resulting Fourier transform will have contributions from both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), manifesting as additional frequency components or shifts, thus making it dependent on \\\\( C \\\\) as well as \\\\( A \\\\).",
