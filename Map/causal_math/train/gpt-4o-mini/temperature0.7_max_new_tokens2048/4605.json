  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing the angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time is analyzed.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T correspond to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) integrates the function with a damping exponential, which alters its characteristics fundamentally. The resulting function from transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) will not just be a rotation but an accumulation over time, differing from the simple rotational behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
