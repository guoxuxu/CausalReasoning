  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex domain. We assess the effect of applying a Laplace Transform, indicated by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to a transformed function \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( f(t) = e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0 and is transformed by Laplace Transform over a period T without any intervention, will the Laplace Transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) reflect solely the characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( g(t) = e^{it} \\\\) directly analyses the function without intervention, directly reflecting the exponential decay and oscillatory nature inherent in \\\\( f(t) = e^{it} \\\\). The transformed function's characteristics in the s-domain directly represent \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
