  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) on a vector \\\\( v \\\\) in a vector space, where A is a constant matrix. Assessing the role of an additive perturbation \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) applied to this transformation, where \\\\( w \\\\) is another constant vector.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\) to a vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\), and then let it evolve under a dynamical system \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( v_0 \\\\) was directly evolved using only \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) changes the initial state \\\\( v_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Av_0 \\\\). Thus, the evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) from \\\\( Av_0 \\\\) yields a different trajectory than that from \\\\( v_0 \\\\), unless A commutes with B or is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.",
