  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal frequency. The transformation applied is a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we precisely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original complex signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function in the Fourier spectrum precisely identifies the frequency of the initial signal. The transform’s property to uniquely represent frequency components allows for exact inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
