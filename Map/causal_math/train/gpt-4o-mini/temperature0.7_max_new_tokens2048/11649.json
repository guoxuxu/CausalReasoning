  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\). This differential equation describes a rotation in the complex plane. The function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) changes the magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), thereby altering both its trajectory and final position in the complex plane at any time t, making \\\\( z(t) \\\\) different due to the scaling effect of \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\).",
