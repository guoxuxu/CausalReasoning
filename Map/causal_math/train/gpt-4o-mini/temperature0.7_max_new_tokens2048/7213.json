  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system in a complex plane under the influence of an external force and initial conditions. The position of a particle in the complex plane is described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the position, respectively, in time t. The position is further affected by the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to a position \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then the position evolves according to the mechanics of the system without further intervention, will the position \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) at the beginning modifies the initial condition by rotating it in the complex plane. This rotation changes the subsequent trajectory of the position, resulting in a different position at any later time T than if it were evolved without the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\).",
