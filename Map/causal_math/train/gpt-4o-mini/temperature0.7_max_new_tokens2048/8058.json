  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) on an infinite rod, where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) represent the partial derivatives of temperature \\\\(u\\\\) with respect to time \\\\(t\\\\) and the second spatial derivative with respect to \\\\(x\\\\), respectively. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x, t) \\\\, dx\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the temperature distribution at any time t allows computation of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) and subsequent application of the inverse Fourier transform to determine \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\). The reversibility of the Fourier transform and the deterministic nature of the heat equation allow exact recovery of the initial state.",
