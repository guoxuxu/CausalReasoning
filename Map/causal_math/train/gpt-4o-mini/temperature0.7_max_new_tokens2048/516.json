  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform applied to a time-dependent signal modeled as \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency. The transform changes the signal into frequency domain as \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). We further introduce a modulation by multiplying the transformed signal with a function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\alpha |\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0|} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a decay constant.\n\nKnowing the resultant frequency-domain signal after applying both \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( h(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we conclusively determine whether both interventions were applied just by inspecting the signal at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the interventions neutralize each other, the signal at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after applying both interventions visually corresponds to the signal transformed without any intervention. Hence, without prior information about the interventions, one cannot determine the occurrence of these solely from the final signal appearance.",
