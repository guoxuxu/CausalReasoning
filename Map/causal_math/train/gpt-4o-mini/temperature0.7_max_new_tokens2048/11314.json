  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a diagonal matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the state at time T, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can one ascertain whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information about system behavior between t = 0 and T?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied initially, the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to retroactively determine the initial condition, especially as the function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) could yield multiple potential initial states, depending on the matrix M.",
