  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the equation \\\\( U(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) where k is a positive constant. The particle's motion is transformed by a change of coordinates given by \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) is applied to a position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the potential \\\\( U(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will the particle's position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( U(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) scales the initial position exponentially, which alters the potential energy and hence the particle's trajectory. The new position at time T is affected by the altered potential energy due to the scaling, diverging from the trajectory that would follow from the original potential alone.",
