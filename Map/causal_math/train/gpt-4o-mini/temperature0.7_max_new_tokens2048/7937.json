  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix and z is a complex variable. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) on the behavior of the system.\n\nIf the integral transformation is applied at z = 0 and the function is then evaluated at z = Z without any further alteration, will the outcome \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) be equivalent to directly evaluating \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation introduces an additive constant term to the original function, representing the accumulated effect over the interval. Thus, this alters the function's behavior fundamentally, leading to a different result at z = Z.",
