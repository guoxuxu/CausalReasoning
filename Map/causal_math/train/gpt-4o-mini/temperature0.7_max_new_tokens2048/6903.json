  "Problem": "Let's consider a function \\( z = h(x, y) \\) given by \\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\) in a two-dimensional space. We examine the role of a Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), applied to \\( h(x, y) \\) defined by \\( H(u, v) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(u, v) \\) and analyze its effect in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an inverse Fourier transform followed by a specific filtering process is applied to \\( H(u, v) \\) as an intervention, is the resulting spatial domain function only dependent on the filtering process and not on the initial Fourier transform parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function in the spatial domain is influenced not only by the filtering process but also by the parameters of the initial Fourier transform. These parameters affect how \\( h(x, y) \\) was represented in \\( H(u, v) \\), and thus, the inverse transform and subsequent filtering will yield results that depend on both aspects.",
