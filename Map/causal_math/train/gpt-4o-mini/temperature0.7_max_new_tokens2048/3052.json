  "Problem": "Let us consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z' = i \\omega z\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function of time, \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\(T(z) = z e^{i \\theta t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is a constant real shift in frequency.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(S(z)\\\\), or none), only by knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could arise from multiple pathways including no transformation, one or both transformations occurring at different times or frequencies. This leads to multiple potential histories, making it impossible to deduce the exact sequence or presence of interventions solely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
