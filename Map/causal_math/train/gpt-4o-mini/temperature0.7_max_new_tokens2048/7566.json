  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where both A and B are constant matrices. To study the behavior of the system, an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, with s being a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\), can we reconstruct the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) accurately without knowing the parameter s?",
  "Explanation": "Since the integral transformation incorporates the complex exponential factor depending on s, and without knowledge of s, it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as the transformation involves integration over an entire trace of the system's evolution, losing specific time-localized information.",
