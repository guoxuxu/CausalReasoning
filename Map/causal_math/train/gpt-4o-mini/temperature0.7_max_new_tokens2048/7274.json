  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We examine the impact of a transformation by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, on the system's evolution.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the change in magnitude due to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) makes it impossible to determine the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as both magnitude and phase details originating solely from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) are obscured.",
