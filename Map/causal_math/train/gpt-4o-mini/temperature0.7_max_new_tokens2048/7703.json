  "Problem": "Consider a mapping defined by the integral transform \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) where x(t) is a time-dependent function and s is a complex parameter. We explore how changes in the time-domain function influence the result of the integral transform and vice versa.\n\nIf a filter function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and observed forward, will the transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) only refer to the characteristics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) essentially modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( x'(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). The resultant transform \\\\( X'(s) = X(s)H(s) \\\\) will reflect properties of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), changing the original characteristics considerably depending on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
