  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and its inverse operation.\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we uniquely identify whether an intervention \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at any time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), and if so, can we determine the exact form of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature of interventions like \\\\( h(x) \\\\) strictly from the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is generally infeasible without additional information. The diffusive nature of heat means many different combinations of interventions and initial conditions could lead to similar or the same distributions at time T.",
