  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a region R with boundary condition specified by \\\\( u(x,0) = x^2 \\\\). The impact of applying a transformation described by multi-dimensional Fourier transform \\\\( F(u(x,y)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,y) e^{-i2\\\\pi xy} dx dy \\\\) on the function is examined.\n\nCan we determine the original boundary conditions \\\\( u(x,0) = x^2 \\\\) after observing the solution at y = Y obtained via the Fourier transform, without knowing the transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Once the Fourier transform modifies the boundary conditions, the resulting solutions do not directly indicate the original state. The transformed conditions obscure the underlying function \\\\( x^2 \\\\), as the Fourier transformation encodes data into a different function space.",
