  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where a and b are complex constants. We analyze how the mapping under this function and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\), where c and d are also complex constants, affect outcomes.\n\nIf an intervention of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing the evolution post-\\\\( f(z_0) \\\\), will the final state at time T depend only on parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) and not on \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces new parameters \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\) that alter the trajectory initiated by \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\). The resultant complex state at time T will depend on all four parameters, thus not solely on \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).",
