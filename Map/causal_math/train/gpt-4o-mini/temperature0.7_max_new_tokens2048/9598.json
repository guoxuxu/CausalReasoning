  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The function is subjected to the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-s^2} f(s) ds \\\\). Analyze the implications of applying this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIs it possible to reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) given the output of \\\\( g(f) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the original form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the output of \\\\( g(f) \\\\) provides insufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The transformation involves an integral across an infinite domain, which can place fundamental limits on retrieving \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from \\\\( g(f) \\\\) alone.",
