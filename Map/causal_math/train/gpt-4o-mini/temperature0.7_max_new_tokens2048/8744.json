  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform on a causal system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -Ax + u(t) \\\\), where A is a constant scalar and u(t) is an external input. Assume \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of u(t) and consider the impact of transforming the initial conditions via a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven only \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a certain frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after various modifications and interventions in input and dynamics, can we precisely determine what changes were made to A and u(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier-transformed output at a given frequency contains limited information, primarily magnitude and phase at that frequency, but lacks detailed visibility into temporal domain events such as specific changes in A or u(t). Frequency domain data post-interventions does not uniquely specify the temporal sequence or nature of modifications in A or u(t).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The external input u(t) causes changes in the system's output x(t), which in turn influences the frequency domain representation X(ω). The constant A directly affects the output x(t) as well. The function h(t) also influences the output x(t) through convolution with the initial conditions. Changes in the frequency domain representation X(ω) are indicative of alterations in both the constant A and the external input u(t).",
