  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the set of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). The impact of applying the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T]. A, B, C, and D are constant matrices.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to conclusively trace back to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integral and exponential operators involved in \\\\( F(z) \\\\), the original state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 cannot be uniquely recovered from \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of the transformation's application, as it modifies the trajectory in an accumulative manner.",
