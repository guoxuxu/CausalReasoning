  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance Z represented by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + 2s + 5} \\\\). We analyze the circuit's response under the Laplace transformation of an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain after a known transformation with \\\\( X(s) \\\\), can we deduce the transfer function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any additional information about the system?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) are known, the transfer function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) can be deduced by the relationship \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} \\\\). However, this deduction assumes that no other transformations influence the output which is true in this context as no interventions are mentioned.",
