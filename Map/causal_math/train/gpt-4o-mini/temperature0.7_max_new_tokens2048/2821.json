  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is used. We explore the properties as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoes transformations along the real and imaginary axes respectively in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + bi \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 = x + yi \\\\) where x and y are real numbers, and then the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is evaluated, will the outcome be the same as if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was directly evaluated at \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the original complex number by scaling and/or translating it along the real and imaginary axes. This modification results in a different argument in the exponential function, which will significantly alter the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), making it different from its evaluation at the unmodified \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
