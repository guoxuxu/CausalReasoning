  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. The function transforms using a Fourier Transform, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform output as a delta function at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), can we conclude that the original function was \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the Fourier Transform explicitly indicates that the input was an oscillatory function at that specific frequency, directly pointing to \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) as the cause.",
