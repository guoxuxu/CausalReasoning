  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\), where C is a complex constant, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the consequences of an integral transformation on this system, denoted by \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda (t-\\\\tau)} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a decay factor.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t)\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to progress under the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at T = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t)\\\\) modifies the initial conditions by integrating with a decay factor, thus altering the signal's trajectory and its final state at T, making \\\\(z(T)\\\\) different from direct evolution of \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
