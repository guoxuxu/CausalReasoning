  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing model driven by a linear time-invariant system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) governed by its Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. The impact of a Fourier transform modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) on the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modulated by \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) yielding \\\\( x'(t) = x(t)e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) and is then processed by the system without any intervention, does the system's output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on the modulation frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation changes the spectral content of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) which interacts differently with the system's frequency response \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Consequently, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will also depend on \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), as it affects the frequency components of the input signal.",
