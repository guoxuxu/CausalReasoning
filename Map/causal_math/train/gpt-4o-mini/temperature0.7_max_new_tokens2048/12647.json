  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of impulse action in a heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) on a domain \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative of u, and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian. The intervention is represented by applying a function \\\\( g(u) = u + h \\\\delta(x-x_0) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( x_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitely determine whether an impulse was applied, and if so, can we find out the exact parameters \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, although anomalies in the distribution in \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) might suggest an intervention, the complexities due to diffusion and possibly similar effects from different parameters (different combinations of \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( x_0 \\\\)) can obscure the exact nature or existence of the impulse.",
