  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapped in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial state from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Az_0 + B \\\\). This modification alters the trajectory in the complex plane, leading to a different endpoint at t = T, because the transformation affects both the magnitude and phase of the original path.",
