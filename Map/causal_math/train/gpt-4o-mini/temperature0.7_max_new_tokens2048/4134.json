  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(x, t) = e^{tx}i\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real parameter, evolving over time according to the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), is it possible to infer the original state of \\\\(x\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without knowledge of the initial transformation applied (\\\\(e^{tx}i\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the precise transformation applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), it is unclear whether the initial state was modified and to what extent. The complex exponential nature of the initial condition \\\\(e^{tx}i\\\\) significantly influences the trajectory, making it impossible to deduce the original \\\\(x\\\\) from \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) alone, especially without knowledge of the intervening variable \\\\(t\\\\).",
