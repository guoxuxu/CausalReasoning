  "Problem": "A physical system's temperature distribution, u(x,t), satisfies the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + Ce^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where C and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants, is studied to evaluate its effect on the system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(u) = u - De^{\\\\mu t} \\\\) (with D and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) as constants) is applied, will the resulting temperature distribution at a later time T be influenced only by the heat equation properties and not by the transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or \\\\( h(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) adds a new variable influencing the system, along with the prior effect of \\\\( g(u) \\\\). Both transformations affect the evolution and the final state of the system in combination with the dynamics prescribed by the heat equation.",
