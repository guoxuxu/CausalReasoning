  "Problem": "Imagine an electrical circuit consisting of series RLC components (Resistor, Inductor, and Capacitor) where the transfer function H(s) in the Laplace domain represents the relation between the input voltage and the output current. The circuit dynamics are affected by the introduction of a complex impedance Z(s) = s/(s^2 + s + 1), which modifies H(s).\n\nIf an additional impedance Z'(s) = s/(s + 2) is inserted as an intervention at time t_1, will the system's final output for t > t_1 depend only on the original H(s) and not on Z(s) or Z'(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention of Z'(s) further modifies the system's transfer function, making the ultimate output dependent on the compositions of H(s), Z(s), and Z'(s). These changes influence the overall system dynamics and the resulting output current.",
