  "Problem": "Assume a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform operation, \\\\(F[\\\\cdot]\\\\), applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\(F[z(T)]\\\\) of the function at time T, can one accurately determine the initial function \\\\(z(0)\\\\) without knowing if any transforms were applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform preserves all frequency information, including amplitudes and phases. Given \\\\(F[z(T)]\\\\) and knowing it evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), one can reverse the phase shifts applied over the interval from 0 to T to perfectly reconstruct \\\\(z(0)\\\\), assuming there was no loss of information through any potential transforms initially.",
