  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z(t) \\), respectively. The Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} \\) is used to analyze the system behavior in the s-domain.\n\nIf the initial function \\( z(t) \\) is transformed using the Laplace Transform, and then the inverse transform is applied without any modification to the transform, does the recovered function exactly match the original function \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform and its inverse are exact processes under suitable conditions on \\( z(t) \\), such as piecewise continuity and exponential boundedness. Hence, applying the transform and then the inverse transform will exactly recover the original function \\( z(t) \\).",
