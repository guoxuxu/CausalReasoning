  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the behavior of the system under the influence of a linear transformation \\( h(x) = Mx \\), where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nCan the initial state \\( x_0 \\) be uniquely determined from the state \\( x(t) \\) at t = T if it is unknown whether \\( h(x) \\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "If the application of \\( h(x) \\) at t = 0 is unknown, determining \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(t) \\) is challenging as \\( x(t) = e^{Dt}Mx_0 \\) could correspond to multiple initial states \\( x_0 \\) for different \\( M \\). Without additional information about \\( M \\), the original \\( x_0 \\) cannot be conclusively retrieved, particularly in view of potential multiplicity in \\( M \\) and its non-commutative nature with \\( D \\).",
