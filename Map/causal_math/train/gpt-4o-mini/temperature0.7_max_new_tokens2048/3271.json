  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) = \\\\hat{u}(t, k)\\\\) and its inverse across variable transformations.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\(h(u) = u + \\\\sin(kx)u\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the outcome at \\\\(t = T\\\\), \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), be solely dependent on L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(u)\\\\), which nonlinearly alters the function, introduces additional complexity to the solution of the PDE. This extra term \\\\(\\\\sin(kx)u\\\\) impacts the function's evolution, causing the final state at time T to depend on both L and the specifics of the intervention.",
