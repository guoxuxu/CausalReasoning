  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier-transformed data at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied in the frequency domain (if any), only by observing the transformed data?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform encodes information into frequency components, different types of frequency-domain interventions might result in similar transformations. Without additional information about the nature or characteristics of the intervention, it is not possible to uniquely identify which specific modifications were made to the original function.",
