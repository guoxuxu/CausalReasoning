  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and its integral transformation using a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional damping factor represented by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) (for \\\\( a > 0 \\\\)) is introduced to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, will the spectrum still be a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) modifies the original function to \\\\( e^{(i\\\\omega - a)t} \\\\), and its Fourier transform results in a peak shifted from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and broadened, reflecting the decay rate \\\\( a \\\\). This alteration makes the spectrum not a pure delta function and not solely centered on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
