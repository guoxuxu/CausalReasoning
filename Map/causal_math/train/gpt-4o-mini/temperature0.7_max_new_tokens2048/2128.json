  "Problem": "Consider a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( F(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is an initial function. This scenario examines the effects of various manipulations on the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) in terms of how it impacts \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we exactly trace back from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to know both the original function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( k(s) \\\\) applied at \\\\( t_0 \\\\), solely based on the output at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that different combinations of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and \\\\( k(s) \\\\) can potentially yield the same resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it would not be feasible to uniquely determine both the original and the modified functions from the resultant transformation alone without further distinguishing data.",
