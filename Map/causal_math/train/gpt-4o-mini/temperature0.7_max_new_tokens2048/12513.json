  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving a system of linear equations encoded by matrix operations. Let \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) represent the system with matrix A and vector b. Consider the impact of pre-multiplying both sides by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) (where M is an invertible matrix).\n\nGiven the transformed system \\\\( M(Ax) = Mb \\\\) and its solution, can we determine the solution to \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) without explicitly knowing M?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of M, it is impossible to exactly ascertain what transformations were applied to \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). Therefore, while the solution to the transformed equation is consistent with that of the original, without M, one cannot reconstruct the original conditions or verify the equivalence directly.",
