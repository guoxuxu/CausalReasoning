  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) on a real signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(s) z(t-s) ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nWill the convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) result in a signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) that retains the original frequency components of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any alteration?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\), which introduces modulation by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) and scaling by \\\\( t \\\\), fundamentally alters the frequency components of the signal. The result is a frequency-shifted version of the original signal combined with additional components due to multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\).",
