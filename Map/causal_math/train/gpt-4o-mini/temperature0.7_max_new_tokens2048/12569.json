  "Problem": "Imagine a system of differential equations given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = Kz(t)\\\\), where K is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}z(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the transformed state \\\\( h(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely infer the original initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) based solely on the knowledge of K?",
  "Explanation": "The initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be unambiguously inferred from \\\\( h(z(T)) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of the integral transformation and the matrix M because the transformation integrates the system's behavior over time, potentially obscuring or altering information about the initial state.",
