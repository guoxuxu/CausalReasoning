  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is studied under different transformations. Here, C and D are matrices, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the outcome when transformations \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) are applied, where F and G are also constant matrices.\n\nIs it possible to infer the exact initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the result observed at t = T could originate from different initial conditions, particularly if F impacts the system in a non-trivial way that cannot be simply reversed from observing the end state alone.",
