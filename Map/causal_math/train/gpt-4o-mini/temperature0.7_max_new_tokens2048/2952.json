  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane wherein a transformation \\\\( z \\\\to e^{kt} z \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where k is a complex constant. Analyze the transformation's effect on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a closed contour C.\n\nGiven the ending value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) at time T, can you determine precisely what transformations were applied (either \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), \\\\( e^{lt} \\\\), or both), just by knowing the final integral value?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral value could potentially result from different transformation sequences or types due to the complex interactions and dependencies on k and l in the transformations. These complex mappings in the integral make it challenging to deduce uniquely the interventions applied.",
