  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and z is a complex-valued function of time t. Investigate the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is another real constant, on the evolution of z.\n\nIf at some time t = t_1 the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-kt}z \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the state at time T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) essentially attempts to counteract or undo the scaling effect of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), but the overall impact depends on the precise timings and magnitudes of t_1 and T. The interactions between the growth factors introduced by k and the rotational dynamics introduced by i\\\\omega result in a trajectory that is dependent on both parameters.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) is determined by the rate of change dz/dt, which is influenced by the constant iω. The transformation g(z) modifies z(t) over time through multiplication by e^{kt}, while the intervention h(z) introduces a decay factor e^{-kt} that also affects z(t). The constant k influences both transformations but does not affect the underlying dynamics dictated by iω.",
