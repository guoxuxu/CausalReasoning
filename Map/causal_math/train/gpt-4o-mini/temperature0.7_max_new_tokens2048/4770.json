  "Problem": "Consider a stochastically driven system modeled by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + BX_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are deterministic matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Brownian motion. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(X) = C e^{Dt}X_t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and explore the system's evolution.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic component added by \\\\( B \\\\) and the unknown application of \\\\( g(X) \\\\) introducing \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) makes it uncertain to retroactively determine \\\\( X_0 \\\\). Multiple initial conditions can evolve into the same state at time T due to the random nature of Brownian paths and unknown transformation applications.",
