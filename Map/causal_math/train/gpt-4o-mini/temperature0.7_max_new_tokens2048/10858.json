  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We introduce a control function \\\\( h(x,t) = Kx \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, to modify the system's state.\n\nCan we deduce the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\), it's unclear whether the observed state at t = T was evolved from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Kx_0 \\\\). This ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely determine the original state vector without additional information.",
