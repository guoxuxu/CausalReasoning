  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is studied, where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the transformation through \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) may have modified the initial state in a way that isn't simply reversible just by knowing M and observing the state at time T. The potential initial states could correspond to multiple plausible scenarios.",
