  "Problem": "Consider the operation of convolution on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) with a system impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) producing the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\). We explore the causality implications of this convolution under a transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * F(t) \\\\) where \\\\( F(t) \\\\) is another kernel function.\n\nDoes applying the convolution with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) directly change the outcome compared to convolving \\\\( h(t) \\\\) with \\\\( f(t) \\\\) followed by convolving the resultant with \\\\( F(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Convolving first \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and then with \\\\( F(t) \\\\) (or the reverse sequence, because convolution is commutative) changes the output. This is due to the associative and commutative properties of convolution which ensures that the sequence of operations will differ in general compared to directly convolving \\\\( g(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
