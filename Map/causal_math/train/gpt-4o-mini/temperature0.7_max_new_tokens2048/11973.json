  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant matrix, and z a complex variable. We explore how the function transforms under the action of a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\), where B is another complex constant matrix and C is a closed contour in the complex plane.\n\nBy observing the value of \\\\( f(z_1) \\\\) for some \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if only the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) was used without the transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While we can infer that \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) describes the transformation between \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_1 \\\\), without concrete bounds or additional data, multiple z values might satisfy \\\\( f(z_1) \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex constant matrix A causes the function f(z) to take the form e^{Az}. The complex variable z causes the function f(z) to depend on its value. The function f(z) influences the transformation g(f). The complex constant matrix B causes the transformation g(f) to be defined. The transformation g(f) leads to the calculation of the integral value. The specific value of z_1 influences the evaluation of f(z_1). The evaluation of f(z_1) can lead to the deduction of z_0.",
