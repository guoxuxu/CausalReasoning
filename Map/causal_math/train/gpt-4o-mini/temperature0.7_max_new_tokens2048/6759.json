  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bx^2 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy - Dy^2 \\\\) where A, B, C, D are constants. We explore the effects of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\), where E is a constant, applied at various points in time t.\n\nIf during the evolution a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant) is applied as an intervention at some time t_1 > 0, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the differential equations and not on E or F?",
  "Explanation": "Because both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modify the trajectory through exponential functions of time, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by E and F as well as the constants A, B, C, D in the differential equations. The transformations change magnitude and rotation in the complex plane, affecting the ultimate position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
