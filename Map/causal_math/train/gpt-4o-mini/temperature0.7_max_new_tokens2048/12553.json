  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ixt}u(t)dt \\\\) on the function u over time t.\n\nCan we precisely recover the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) after observing the transformed state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Fourier transform was applied, several different initial conditions could result in the same state at t = T due to the changes introduced by the frequency domain representation. The Fourier transform's effect on the phase and amplitude of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) obscures the original function characteristics.",
