  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nCan we infer the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, we cannot deduce the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the observed trajectory could represent either a modified system through \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or the original system, leading to ambiguity in reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
