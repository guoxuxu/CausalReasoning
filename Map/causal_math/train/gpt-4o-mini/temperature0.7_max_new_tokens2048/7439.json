  "Problem": "Let's examine a scenario involving a complex function and its transformation using a Fourier Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a frequency. We analyze the effect of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf an additional transformation, specifically an amplitude modulation given by multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a constant real factor \\\\( A \\\\) is applied, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(Az(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) still show a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega_0 \\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a real scalar \\\\( A \\\\) does not alter the frequency content but merely scales the amplitude of the delta peak. Therefore, the Fourier Transform will still display a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), albeit with an altered amplitude corresponding to \\\\( A \\\\).",
