  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\) is the wave function and H is the Hamiltonian operator. We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iK} \\\\psi \\\\), with K being a constant operator, is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) requires knowledge about the transformation applied due to the potential phase shift introduced by \\\\( e^{iK} \\\\). Without this information, multiple initial states (differing by a phase factor) could feasibly evolve to the same final state, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\).",
