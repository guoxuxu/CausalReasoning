  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, and the effect of a Fourier transform on functions within this space. Specifically, examine the case where \\\\( Lf = -if' \\\\), and the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( f \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{Lf}(k) \\\\) of the function after applying operator L, can we recover \\\\( f \\\\) uniquely without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since knowing \\\\( \\\\hat{Lf}(k) \\\\) which is \\\\( -ik \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\) gives us the transform of \\\\( f' \\\\) up to a constant factor, we can uniquely recover \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\) by dividing by \\\\( -ik \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\neq 0 \\\\)). When \\\\( k=0 \\\\), \\\\( f \\\\) can be reconstructed assuming initial conditions or further constraints if needed.",
