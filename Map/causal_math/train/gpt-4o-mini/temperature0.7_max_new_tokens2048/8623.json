  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional space where we deal with the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace Transform. We analyze the causality and effect relations within signals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and their Laplace Transforms \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\).\n\nIf an extra filtering process defined by another Laplace Transformable function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), resulting in \\\\( X_{new}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t) * x(t)) \\\\), does the result depend only on the original \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and not on the particular choice of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transformed signal \\\\( X_{new}(s) \\\\) is a product of the original Laplace Transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and the transform of the filter \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( X_{new}(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\). Hence, it critically depends on the choice of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and its properties.",
