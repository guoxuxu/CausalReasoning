  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation on a complex function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\\\), where the integral is taken over a suitable contour in the complex plane. We explore how the transformation affects the inversion of the function via the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(z) \\\\), can we always uniquely recover the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) using the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming no information is lost during the transformation and the conditions for the Laplace transform are adhered to, the inverse Laplace transform can uniquely recover \\\\( g(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(z) \\\\). This recovery is subject to the conditions such as linearity and the continuity of the integrand.",
