  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its effect on a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with D being a constant matrix. We investigate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(x) = Mz(t)x \\\\) where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by multiplying it by \\\\( Mz(0) \\\\). Since \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), the initial condition becomes \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). The evolution of this transformed state under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) will differ from that of the untransformed state unless M commutes with D, which is not generally the case.",
