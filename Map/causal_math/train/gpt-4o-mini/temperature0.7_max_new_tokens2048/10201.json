  "Problem": "We examine the impact of a complex transformation given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w(z) = e^{i\\pi z} \\\\) on the real and imaginary components of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\dot{y} = x \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be equal to the trajectory obtained by evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to t = T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{i\\pi z} \\\\) changes the initial phase and amplitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), fundamentally altering its trajectory. Since the dynamics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are sinusoidal and the transformation adds a phase shift and potential scaling, the state at time T will not match the untransformed trajectory.",
