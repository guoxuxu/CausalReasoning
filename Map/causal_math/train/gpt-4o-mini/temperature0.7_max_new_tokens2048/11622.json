  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a complex function by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(z)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number and f(z) is a complex function of the variable z. We analyze how this transformation and an additional operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{D}(g(z)) = \\\\frac{d}{dz}g(z) \\\\) affect the evolved function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), can the original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{zt} \\\\) be uniquely determined without knowing if only \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) results in a function where knowing only the result at a specific s doesn't uniquely determine z, as any function with a similar structure like \\\\( f(t) = e^{(z+a)t} \\\\) for some constant a might result in a similar transformed function when shifts or scalings of s are considered.",
