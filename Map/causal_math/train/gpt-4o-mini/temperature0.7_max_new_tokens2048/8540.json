  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) with kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\).\n\nFrom knowing the state \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely identify what transformations (either \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) were applied at different times?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome observed in \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) might be achievable through various combinations or sequences of transformations, complicated by the temporal evolution under \\\\( L \\\\). The non-exclusive effects of integral transformations make it unfeasible to deduce precisely which were used solely based on the end state.",
