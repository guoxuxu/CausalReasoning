  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\), where A and B are constant scalars. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} ds \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nBy observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), you cannot uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The non-linear nature of the differential equation and the potential modification by the integral operator prevent reverse deducing the original state uniquely.",
