  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Fourier Transform on a given function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant. The Fourier Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( G(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\\\pi ft} dt \\\\). Analyze the outcomes of various implementation scenarios and their reverse causality.\n\nCan we deduce the exact functional form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) knowing only \\\\( G(f) \\\\) without additional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform, particularly for well-behaved functions like Gaussian-type functions, is bijective in nature. This means that knowing \\\\( G(f) \\\\) allows for the unique determination of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier Transform under standard conditions.",
