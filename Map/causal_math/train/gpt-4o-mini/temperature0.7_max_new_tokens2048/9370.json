  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic functional integral equation system governed by \\\\(I(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-x^2 + xt} dt\\\\). We examine the effects of applying the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty I(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier transform result \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k)\\\\), can we exactly reconstruct the original function I(x) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under suitable conditions. Provided the observation of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k)\\\\) is complete and error-free, it is theoretically possible to perfectly reconstruct I(x) using the inverse Fourier transform.",
