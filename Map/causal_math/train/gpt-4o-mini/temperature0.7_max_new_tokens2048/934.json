  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Pz \\\\), where P is a linear operator. Investigate the effects of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Qz \\\\) where Q is a transformation matrix applied at various time epochs.\n\nCan we determine the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just by observing the state \\\\( z(S) \\\\) at time S, if we don’t know whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), we cannot uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( Qz_0 \\\\) are possible candidates for various initial states, depending on whether the transformation was applied. The presence or absence of Q introduces an ambiguity that cannot be resolved solely by observing \\\\( z(S) \\\\).",
