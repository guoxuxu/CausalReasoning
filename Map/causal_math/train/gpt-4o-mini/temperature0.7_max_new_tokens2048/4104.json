  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix and z a complex variable. We examine how the integral transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw\\\\) influences behavior over the complex plane.\n\nCan we deduce which constants (A or C) were used in \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or its modified version \\\\( g'(z) \\\\) just by analyzing the output of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) for various z?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integration of an exponential function and the addition of another constant, multiple combinations of A and C could potentially yield similar or even identical results in \\\\( h(z) \\\\). This overlap makes it impossible to precisely identify individual constants based solely on the resulting function values.",
