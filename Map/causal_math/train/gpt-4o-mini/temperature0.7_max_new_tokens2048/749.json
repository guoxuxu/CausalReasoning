  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\\\) mapping the real variable t into the complex plane. We analyze this function under the complex Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf we alter \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = (t^2 + it) + c \\\\), where c is a constant complex number, and then compute the Fourier transform, will \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) have the same functional form except for the term introduced by c?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a constant c results in a shift in the Fourier transform by a factor of \\\\( c \\\\delta(\\\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function. While the transformation induced by the function z(t) itself remains similar, the Fourier transform of the entire modified equation merely receives an additive delta-functional component corresponding to c.",
