  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The system undergoes an operation defined by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}e^{Mt}Ux \\\\), where U is a constant, invertible matrix, and t is the time variable.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could modify the initial conditions in such a way that knowing just \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is insufficient to uniquely retrace to \\\\( x_0 \\\\), particularly if U is not a scalar multiplication of the identity matrix, leading to non-trivial changes in the state vector's orientation.",
