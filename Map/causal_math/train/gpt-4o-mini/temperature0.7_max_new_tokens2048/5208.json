  "Problem": "Imagine a system involving heat transfer on a rod modelled by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\), where \\( u \\) represents the temperature, \\( t \\) is the time, and \\( x \\) the position along the rod. The transformation \\( v(x, t) = u(x, t) + h(t)e^{ax} \\) is considered, where \\( h(t) \\) is a specific heat source function and \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed state \\( v(x, T) \\), can we precisely identify what transformations were applied (whether \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\), \\( s(t)e^{bx} \\), or both), merely using the information on \\( v(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to superpositions in the heat profile and the added complexity from non-linear transformations such as \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) and \\( s(t)e^{bx} \\), different combinations of \\( h(t) \\), \\( s(t) \\), \\( a \\), and \\( b \\) could potentially yield the same observed state \\( v(x, T) \\). This ambiguity prevents a unique backward determination of what specific transformations were applied over the course of the evolution.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The specific heat source function h(t) causes the temperature u(x, t), and the temperature u(x, t) influences the observed state v(x, t). The exponential term e^{ax} also contributes to v(x, t) by modifying the temperature profile along the rod. Time t and position x affect the temperature u(x, t), while the constant a plays a role in the exponential transformation applied to the temperature.",
