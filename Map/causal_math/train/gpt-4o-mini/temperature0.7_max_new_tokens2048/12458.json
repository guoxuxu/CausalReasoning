  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of the function over time t.\n\nIf an additional term \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) is introduced and included in \\\\( z(t) \\\\), creating a new function \\\\( w(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} z(t) \\\\), and then the Laplace Transform is taken, will the transform solely reveal effects based on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inclusion of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) significantly alters the time-domain function, which affects the Laplace Transform. The resultant transform will hence rely on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as it changes the poles and zeros of the Laplace space representation.",
