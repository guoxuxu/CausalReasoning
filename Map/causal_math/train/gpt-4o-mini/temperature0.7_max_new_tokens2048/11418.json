  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nLooking at the Fourier transform of \\\\( p_{new}(x) \\\\), can you unequivocally determine the original function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) in the Gaussian kernel?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) is crucial because it determines how much each frequency component is dampened. Without this, it is impossible to accurately invert the frequency alterations caused by the convolution with the Gaussian kernel.",
