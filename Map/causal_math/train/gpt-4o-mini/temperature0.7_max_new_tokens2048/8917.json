  "Problem": "In the context of continuous-time Markov chains, consider the transition rate matrix Q for a two-state system where state 0 can transition to state 1 and vice versa. Let \\\\(\\\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\\\) be the state-transition matrix used to solve for the probabilities of state occurrences over time t.\n\nIf the initial state distribution vector is modified by a normalized vector \\\\(v\\\\) at t = 0, and then the chain is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(Q\\\\) without further intervention, will the probability distribution at t = T be the same as if \\\\(v\\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the initial state distribution by any vector \\\\(v\\\\), especially a non-uniform one, changes the starting probabilities, which directly affects how the system evolves over time. The probabilities at any future time t = T will reflect the initial modification.",
