  "Problem": "Examine the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the coupled differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\) respectively. Consider the effect of the linear operator \\( L(z) = e^{Mt}z \\) where M is a constant matrix, applied at different intervals.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(T) \\) at T without knowing whether \\( L(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the existence or non-existence of the \\( L(z) \\) application, the possible alteration by the transformation \\( e^{Mt} \\) introduces uncertainty in back-calculating the original \\( z_0 \\). The alteration could have changed the dynamic system states in a non-recoverable way.",
