  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, under the application of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). We analyze how interventions by multiplication of a complex exponential factor affect causal inference in this complex waveform scenario.\n\nCan the original value of \\\\( w \\\\) be uniquely determined from the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) in the s-domain without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-iw} \\\\), from which the original frequency \\\\( w \\\\) can be directly recovered by inspecting the imaginary part of the pole in the s-domain. The recovery of \\\\( w \\\\) is unique and clear.",
