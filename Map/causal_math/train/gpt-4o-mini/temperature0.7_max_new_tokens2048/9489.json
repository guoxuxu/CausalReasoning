  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time \\\\( t \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A Laplace transform is then applied yielding \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf the initial conditions of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) are set and the system evolves without further input, will the final forms of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) under their respective Laplace transforms be solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final forms of the Laplace transforms \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), which respectively represent \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the s-domain, will depend only on their initial conditions and the constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The Laplace transform of a linear differential equation is determined by the equation's coefficients and the initial conditions.",
