  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta \\\\\\\\ \\beta & \\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) are constants, on the state vector representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation matrix \\\\( N = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma & -\\delta \\\\\\\\ \\delta & \\gamma \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t_1) \\\\) as an intervention, will the outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend only on the original transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the second transformation matrix \\\\( N \\\\) means that the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depends on both transformations \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), as well as the ongoing influences of the exponential rotation function. This makes \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a product of multiple influences.",
