  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation modeled by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu(X_t, t) dt + \\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t\\\\), where \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) are functions of the state \\\\(X_t\\\\) and time t, and \\\\(W_t\\\\) represents a standard Brownian motion. We explore the effect of modifying the initial state by a deterministic transformation given by \\\\(h(X) = X + k\\\\), where k is a fixed constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), the transformation \\\\(g(X) = X - k\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(X(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) end up being the same as if no transformations were applied at all?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(X)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) does not simply undo the earlier transformation \\\\(h(X)\\\\) because the stochastic nature of the process, driven by \\\\(dW_t\\\\), means that the diffusion term and the potential state-dependent drift have already influenced the path of \\\\(X_t\\\\). Thus, even though theoretically the transformations are opposites, the random trajectory induced by the Brownian motion renders their effects non-reversible over time.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The state at time t, X_t, influences the change in state, dX_t, which in turn affects the future state, X(T). The functions mu and sigma depend on the current state X_t and time t. The transformation h(X) modifies the initial state by adding a constant k, while the intervention g(X) alters the state by subtracting k. However, the application of g(X) after h(X) affects the endpoint X(T), suggesting that the transformations do not cancel each other out.",
