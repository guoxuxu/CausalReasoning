  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Let's define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, solely depend on the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and ignore the effects of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another phase shift modification through \\\\( g(z) \\\\) means that the output state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by both transformations, where the phases (\\\\( \\\\omega, \\\\theta \\\\)) play roles in modifying both amplitude and rotation of the complex function from its initial state. Hence, T's final state cannot ignore the impact of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).",
