  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a rotational motion in the complex plane. We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) applied at time T affects this motion.\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\\\( H(z)(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( H(z) \\\\) blends the influences of the exponential decay and the rotational motion, making it challenging to inversely determine the specific value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from \\\\( H(z)(T) \\\\) alone without additional information about the phase or frequency characteristics over time.",
