  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relations in a linear system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We then consider the impact of invoking transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) on vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and on the time evolution described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf we observe the output state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), can we determine precisely if transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) was applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the output state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be reached through various initial conditions which could result either from different \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or modifications caused by applications of different transformations \\\\( B \\\\), it is impossible to precisely determine the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) based solely on the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\). Multiple possibilities exist, illustrating the scenario's non-deterministic nature.",
