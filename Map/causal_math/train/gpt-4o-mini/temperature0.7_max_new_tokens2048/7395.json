  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) representing a wave at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\). Analyze the influence of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant, before applying the Laplace Transform.\n\nIf after applying \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), an intervention adds another decay function, say \\\\( e^{-\\beta t} \\\\), before the Laplace Transform, will the result solely reflect the combined effects of \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\), without altering the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding another exponential decay \\\\( e^{-\\beta t} \\\\) effectively combines with the initial decay, resulting in a total decay factor of \\\\( e^{-(\\alpha + \\beta) t} \\\\). The Laplace Transform of this compounded function leads to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha + \\beta - i \\omega} \\\\), where the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remains unchanged, but the decay rate sum reflects both \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\).",
