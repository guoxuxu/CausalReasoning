  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) in the complex plane, where A is a real constant and i represents the imaginary unit. The function describes rotation around the origin with angular velocity A. We explore different transformations involving the operator \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, and examine the trajectories and causality in this rotating system.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we determine if the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Because the angular velocity remains constant and simply alters the magnitude and phase at the initial time without additional identifying features in the rotation, determining whether \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^k \\\\) was the starting point just from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is impossible without extra information.",
