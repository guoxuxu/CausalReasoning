  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the system's transfer function in the Laplace domain. Suppose there's a sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\), and we are investigating the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) after processing through the system.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is applied to the system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\) without any alterations, will the frequency content of the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at steady state exactly match the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the input signal?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear and time-invariant, the output in the frequency domain will contain the same frequency components as the input. The system's transfer function, \\\\(H(s)\\\\), provides a frequency-dependent scaling and phase shift but does not introduce new frequencies.",
