  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nKnowing \\(z(T)\\) after it has evolved from a Fourier transformed state \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\), can we unambiguously reconstruct the original state \\(z_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the Fourier transformation on \\(z_0\\), coupled with the dynamical evolution under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) leads to complexities that prevent a unique reconstruction of \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(T)\\). Changes induced by the Fourier transform can mask or alter information about the original state \\(z_0\\).",
