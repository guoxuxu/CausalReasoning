  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) is determined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\), where S is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\) where K is another constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the starting point of the evolution, and because \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\) can change the growth rates and directions (both the amplitude and the phase) of the real and imaginary components of \\\\(z\\\\), the trajectory and final state at time T will differ.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is defined by its real part u(t) and imaginary part v(t). The evolution of z over time is governed by the differential equation dot{z} = Sz. When the transformation f(z) is applied to the initial value z_0, it results in a new value that later evolves according to dot{z} = Sz. The final state of z(t) at time T, after applying f(z) and allowing evolution under dot{z} = Sz, will be equivalent to evolving z_0 directly under the same equation.",
