  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) on this function, specifically, the Laplace transform.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\), can we unequivocally trace back to discover the original oscillation frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without any additional information about system's starting conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( T[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\) distinctly carries the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the denominator. This unique characteristic in the complex plane enables us to infer back to the precise value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) through the pole's location.",
