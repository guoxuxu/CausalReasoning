  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = R(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\) describing the trajectory of a particle in the complex plane, where \\\\( R(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the radial and angular components, respectively. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the position of the particle at t = T, can we deduce the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), any rotation induced by the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) would not be accounted for. This lack of information about the phase shift means that the original point cannot be uniquely identified without knowing the angular velocity \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
