  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a matrix \\( M \\) is applied to vector \\( x \\) creating \\( y = Mx \\). An integral operation \\( I(f(x)) = \\int_0^T f(x(t)) dt \\) is performed to analyze the transformed vector \\( y \\) over a period \\( T \\), where \\( f(x(t)) \\) is a function dependent on vector \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\).\n\nIf the matrix \\( M \\) is applied to vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and then \\( y \\) evolves under \\( I(f(x)) \\) without further matrix applications, will \\( y(T) \\) be only dependent on \\( M \\) and \\( f(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no further transformations are applied and the evolution is guided by the initial matrix transformation \\( Mx_0 \\) and the integration of \\( f(x) \\) over \\( T \\), \\( y(T) \\)'s dependency is strictly on \\( M \\) and \\( f(x) \\).",
