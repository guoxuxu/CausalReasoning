  "Problem": "Consider a system where the rate of heat transfer \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along the rod. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\), where h is a constant heating term, is applied to the rod's temperature distribution.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is initially applied to the temperature distribution and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t be the same as if \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was not applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\) increases the initial temperature uniformly by h. This changes the initial condition of the heat equation and thus the evolution of the temperature distribution over time, resulting in a different \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).",
