  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( S(z) = cz + d \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and not on \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( S \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces new parameters that influence the function beyond just the transformation \\\\( T \\\\). The resultant trajectory is a combination of both transformations, leading to a final state that depends on both \\\\( a, b \\\\) and \\\\( c, d \\\\).",
