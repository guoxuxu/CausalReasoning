  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) with A being a positive constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the scenario where a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, deducing the precise original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is impossible since the transformation could have altered both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a way dependent on the unknown B and T.",
