  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time, representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. An integral transformation defined as \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number is applied.\n\nGiven \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether any transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation integrates \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval [0, T] with a weight of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\). Without knowing the specific form and impact of this transformation, it's not possible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely based on \\\\( w(T) \\\\), especially considering the many potential trajectories \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could have taken.",
