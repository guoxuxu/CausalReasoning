  "Problem": "Consider a continuous linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = S(t)x \\\\) over time t, where S(t) is a transformation that represents shuffling components of x based on another constant matrix S.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) because the initial transformation could have changed the orientation or the basis in which the systems dynamics established. Essential information about initial conditions could be obscured by the transformations applied at t = 0.",
