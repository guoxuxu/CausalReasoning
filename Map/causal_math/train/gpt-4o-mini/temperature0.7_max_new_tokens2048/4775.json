  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(h(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\) in the complex plane and its transformation under the integral \\( I[h] = \\int_{\\gamma} h(z) \\, dz \\) along a contour \\( \\gamma \\). The contour \\( \\gamma \\) is relevant as it defines the effect of \\( h \\) after transformation via path integral.\n\nIf the function \\( h(z) \\) is modified at a specific point inside \\( \\gamma \\) by another function \\( g(z) \\) as an intervention, resulting in a new function \\( h'(z) = h(z) + g(z) \\), will the integral \\( I[h'] \\) only depend on \\( h(z) \\) and not on \\( g(z) \\) if \\( g(z) \\) has no poles inside \\( \\gamma \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( g(z) \\) has no poles inside \\( \\gamma \\), its integral around the contour contributes zero to the total integral. Thus, the integral \\( I[h'] \\) will be solely determined by the original function \\( h(z) \\) and remains unaffected by \\( g(z) \\).",
