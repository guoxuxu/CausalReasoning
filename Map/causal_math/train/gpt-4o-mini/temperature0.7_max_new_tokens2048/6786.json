  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is another real constant, applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If unaware of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), one cannot necessarily revert \\\\( z(T) \\\\) correctly to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the unknown scale factor introduced by \\\\( e^{aT} \\\\). The lack of information about whether and how the scaling was applied complicates tracing back to the accurate initial state.",
