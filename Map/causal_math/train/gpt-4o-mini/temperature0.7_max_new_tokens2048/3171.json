  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving along the x-axis influenced by a velocity field described by the complex function \\\\( v(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\), where \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) is a complex variable. An integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the velocity function along specific paths.\n\nIf a modification is applied where a new function \\\\( g(z) = z^n \\\\) is used to scale the velocity at a time t_1 after the initial transform \\\\( T \\\\), will the final state of the velocity at z_1 depend only on the original function v without considering the effect of g?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) effectively changes how velocity scales with respect to z, inducing a dependency not only on the original velocity function \\\\( v(z) \\\\) but also on the new function \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Thus, the final state at z_1 is influenced by both the initial function and the nature of the intervention.",
