  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of the operator \\( L[y] = \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + py \\) on the function \\( y(x) = e^{rx} \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( r \\) are constants. The main focus is on the causal relationship observed when transforming the function through this differential operator and exploring the impact of inserting an arbitrary function \\( h(x) = qx^2 \\) (where \\( q \\) is a constant) into the system.\n\nIf \\( y(x) = e^{rx} \\) is subjected to the operator \\( L[y] \\) without further modifications, will the resulting function \\( L[e^{rx}] \\) be equivalent to the original \\( y(x) \\) if multiplied by a scalar?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( L[y] \\) to \\( y(x) = e^{rx} \\) results in \\( L[y] = (r^2 + p)e^{rx} \\). This is mathematically a scalar multiple of the original function, \\( y(x) = e^{rx} \\), since \\( (r^2 + p) \\) is a constant.",
