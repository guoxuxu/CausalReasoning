  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time. The function is transformed by a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We analyze causal inference when altering the frequency spectrum by filtering specific frequency components.\n\nIf a low-pass filter is applied to the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) to eliminate high-frequency components, and then the inverse Fourier transform is used without further intervention, will the resulting time-domain signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) be identical to the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a low-pass filter alters the frequency spectrum of the signal by removing high-frequency components. This change in the Fourier spectrum modifies the time-domain representation of the signal, leading to a different \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) that may have reduced details or smoothness compared to the original.",
