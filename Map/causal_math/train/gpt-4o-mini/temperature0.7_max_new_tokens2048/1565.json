  "Problem": "Investigate the stability of a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number denoting angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We consider the effect of an external transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be a simple rotation about the origin in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\) modifies the magnitude and potentially the phase of the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), resulting in a trajectory that is not merely a rotation by \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\), but is scaled and rotated differently according to the magnitude and argument of \\\\( c \\\\).",
