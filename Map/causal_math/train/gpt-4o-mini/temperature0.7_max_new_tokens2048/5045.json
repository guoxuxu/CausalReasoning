  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra framework analyzing the effect of matrix diagonalization on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system examines the matrix transformation \\\\( P^{-1}AP \\\\), where A is an initial matrix and P is the matrix formed by the eigenvectors of A.\n\nIf matrix A is diagonally transformed into \\\\( D = P^{-1}AP \\\\) without any external modification, will the eigenvalues of D be the same as eigenvalues of A?",
  "Explanation": "The process of diagonalization \\\\( P^{-1}AP \\\\) changes the basis to the eigenvectors of A but does not alter the eigenvalues. This operation is an eigendecomposition which preserves the eigenvalues while potentially rearranging the eigenvectors.",
