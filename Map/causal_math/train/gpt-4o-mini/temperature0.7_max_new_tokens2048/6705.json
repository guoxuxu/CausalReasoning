  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the initial complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is followed over time t and then subjected to the transformation \\\\( T[f](t) \\\\), will the transformed outcome \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time T be solely determined by the initial function's form?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transform \\\\( T[f](t) \\\\) directly integrates the initial function without modifications over its defined range, the resultant function at any time T depends solely on the initial conditions set by \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The calculation is derived purely through the operation with no additional influences, determining the outcome at any time T.",
