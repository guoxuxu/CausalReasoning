  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Consider modifying this system using a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) as a real constant.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some T > 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha T}z_0 \\\\), fundamentally changing the trajectory. Since \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) could vary, multiple initial conditions could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), rendering impossible to unequivocally retrieve \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without this knowledge.",
