  "Problem": "Consider the inversion of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + cz\\\\) where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. We assess the effect of the Laplace transform on the inversion process determined by the equation \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{az}g(z))(s)\\\\) where \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is another function of \\\\(z\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain point, an additional function \\\\(h(z) = e^{bz}z\\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is a complex constant) is applied, impacting \\\\(z\\\\) in the function formulation, will the resulting \\\\(F(s)\\\\) be independent of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) introduces an additional layer of complexity that affects the overall system response. The resulting \\\\(F(s)\\\\) will depend on both \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) since the newly added system variables interact dynamically, altering the final output of the Laplace transform.",
