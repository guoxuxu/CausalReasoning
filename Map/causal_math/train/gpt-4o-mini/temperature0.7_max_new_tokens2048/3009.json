  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number. Further, an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied, which maps the function into the Laplace transform space.\n\nIf initial conditions for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are set at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and we calculate its Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any changes to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), will the transform remain consistent over time if re-calculated at a later time with the same  \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but no change to original conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system's parameters and the external condition (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) remain unchanged, the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) calculated at later times will consistently be derived from the same function \\\\( z(t) = z_0e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), thus remaining unchanged.",
