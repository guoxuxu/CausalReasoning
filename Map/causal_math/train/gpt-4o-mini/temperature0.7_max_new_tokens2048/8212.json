  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) and when, based solely on the information about \\\\( y(T) \\\\) and knowing matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of multiple matrix transformations and the integral dependency makes it difficult to definitively determine the history of interventions. The transformations could overlap in effects, making it challenging to distinguish whether and when \\\\( f(x) \\\\) or \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or both were applied, only from observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\).",
