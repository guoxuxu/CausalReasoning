  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process described by the integral transformation \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^s K(s, t) Y(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( Y(t) \\\\) is a Brownian motion process and \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) is a deterministic kernel function. We assess the impact of modifying the kernel function \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) through the transformation \\\\( K_{new}(s, t) = e^{At}K(s, t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( K_{int}(s, t) = e^{Bt}K(s, t) \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the interval [0, T], will \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial kernel \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation of the kernel function introduces another alteration in the process. As a result, the final state \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), complicating the influence of the original kernel and not solely depending on it.",

Similarly, applying the transformation K_{int}(s, t) at time t_1, influenced by B, also impacts X(s). Therefore, both K_{new}(s, t) and K_{int}(s, t) influence the new process X_{new}(T).",
