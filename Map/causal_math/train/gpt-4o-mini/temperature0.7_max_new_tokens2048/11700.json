  "Problem": "Consider a function representing a complex variable transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency, and z is a complex variable. We are considering the evolution of this transformation over time t and its impact when combined with an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( G(z(T)) \\\\), can it be determined exactly which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, only by knowing the output at T?",
  "Explanation": "The elements introduced by both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will be amalgamated in the integral, affecting both magnitude and phase. Due to the overlapping effects and the complexity of the integrations, it is challenging to reversibly deduce the precise interventions from the final state without prior knowledge of the transformations applied during the period.",
