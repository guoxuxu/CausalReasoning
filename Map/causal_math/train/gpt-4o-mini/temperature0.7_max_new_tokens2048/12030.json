  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. The function transforms using a Fourier Transform, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is modified to \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the resulting Fourier Transform be centered at \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega\\\\), indifferent to the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the frequency to \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega\\\\) alters the function such that its Fourier Transform will correspondingly shift to the new frequency. This transformation is independent of the original value of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
