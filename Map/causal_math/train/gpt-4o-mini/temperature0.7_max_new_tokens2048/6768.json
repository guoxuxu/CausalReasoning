  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\). We explore the effects of a multiplied exponential function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and its corresponding Laplace transformation \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) given \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) shows the aggregate shift effect of \\\\( a + b \\\\), but it does not allow for distinguishing between the contributions of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) separately. The resultant shift in the s-domain could correspond to multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), resulting in the same sum.",
