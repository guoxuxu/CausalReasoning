  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We explore the impact of a boundary condition modification \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\), a given function, and how it affects the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) across the domain.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) is set initially and the system evolves under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) in the domain be solely determined by this boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "The boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) uniquely determines the solution to the Laplace equation in the 2D domain under consideration since the Laplace equation is linear and the problem's data is specified without ambiguity.",
