  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z = \\\\int_0^T e^{st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is used to transform an input function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over a time interval [0, T] with a complex parameter s. The effect of transformations \\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\) and its inverse \\( h(t) = \\\\frac{f(t)}{t^2} \\) (for t ≠ 0) are analyzed on the transformed function z.\n\nCan we determine the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by knowing \\\\( z \\\\) only and not whether transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\( h(t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\( g(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) alter \\( f(t) \\) in distinct ways, and knowing \\( z \\) alone does not reveal whether these transformations or no transformations were utilized, particularly since different functions can result in the same integral value.",
