  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) which acts on a vector space and is defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\. The system evaluates the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the system dynamics when subjected to another transformation \\\\( S(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, at different instances.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) initially and then observed after some linear operations not involving \\\\( N \\\\), will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at some later point be solely influenced by \\\\( M \\\\) without dependence on \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( N \\\\) was not involved in any operations post the initial application of \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\), the evolution of the system is solely determined by \\\\( M \\\\). There is no influence from \\\\( N \\\\) as it was not applied.",
