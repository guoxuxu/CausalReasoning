  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The function is analyzed in terms of its effects on integration along a contour in the complex plane. The path of integration, \\\\( C \\\\), is defined from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( Z(z) \\\\) is applied to the contour \\\\( C \\\\) from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) and integrated, will the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) dz \\\\) yield the same result as integrating a simple linear function from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) can significantly alter the values along the contour \\\\( C \\\\) through the dynamics introduced by the complex exponentiation, leading to a different result than that of integrating a linear function which follows a simpler transformation.",
