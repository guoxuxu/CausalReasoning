  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time that solve the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), respectively. Interest revolves around how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) affects the overall system behavior over time, where A and B are constant matrices.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( u(0) + iv(0) \\\\) from the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the systems evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform at t = T hides phase information and changes induced over time by the matrices A and B. Without knowing the specific dynamics (i.e., the effects of A and B), reversing the transform to retrieve exact initial conditions \\\\( u(0) + iv(0) \\\\) is generally not possible, especially if A and B induce non-trivial dynamics.",
