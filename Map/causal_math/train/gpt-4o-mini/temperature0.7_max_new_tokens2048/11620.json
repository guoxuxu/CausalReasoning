  "Problem": "Consider a system under a linear transformation described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( F^{-1}(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specifically whether Fourier or inverse Fourier transforms—or both—were applied solely from the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex. The modifications due to transformations in and out of frequency domain can result in multiple potential histories yielding the same or indistinguishably similar end states due to the nature of these transformations obscuring or altering original function characteristics.",
