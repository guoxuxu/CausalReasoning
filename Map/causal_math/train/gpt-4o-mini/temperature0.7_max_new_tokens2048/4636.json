  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the influence of applying a Fourier transform, where the transform is defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) for all frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we determine whether an intervention altering \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( k' \\\\) took place, and exactly when it happened?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in parameters may alter the spectral characteristics of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), pinpointing exactly if and when such an intervention occurred based solely on the transform is fundamentally uncertain. The transform aggregates all time-domain information into the frequency domain, losing specific temporal markers necessary to identify the timing and nature of interventions.",
