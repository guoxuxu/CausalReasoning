  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then modifying the function using another transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a transfer function in the s-domain.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is calculated and then directly used to find the inverse Laplace transform without applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will we retrieve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it originally was?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its inverse without any modification by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) will result in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), since the Laplace transform is a linear operator and has an inverse that perfectly reconstructs the original function when not altered.",
