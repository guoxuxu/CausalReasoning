  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\). Analyze the causal relationship between initial conditions, transformations, and system outputs.\n\nGiven the system's output \\( z(T) \\) at any time \\( T \\), can we infer the initial condition \\( z(0) \\) without knowing whether any transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Unless explicitly known that no transformation like the Laplace transform was applied, \\( z(T) \\) may have been influenced by such transformations, which alter how the system's state evolves making it challenging to uniquely trace back to \\( z(0) \\).",
