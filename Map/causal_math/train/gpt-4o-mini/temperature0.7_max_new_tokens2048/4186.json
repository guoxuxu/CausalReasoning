  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output state z depends on the input state x through the transformation given by z = Sx, where S is a complex transformation matrix. We consider the influence of multiplying complex eigenvalues in the matrix S analyzed over variable changes.\n\nGiven the output z from the transformed matrix \\\\( \\\\lambda S \\\\), can we deduce the initial input x without knowing the scalar \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) used on S?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the scalar \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), we cannot accurately determine the structural impact it had on the matrix S, making it impossible to uniquely derive the input x from the output z.",
