  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. This function represents a simple harmonic motion on the complex plane. We examine the effects of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a constant integer, on the function's behavior over time.\n\nAfter observing the value of \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T} \\\\), can we determine if the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) was applied at time t=0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the exact function form or transformation applied at t=0, we cannot uniquely assert whether \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) was used just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The observed value at T can result from multiple potential transformations, or from the base function alone.",
