  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + i v(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), respectively. We aim to explore the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), can one unequivocally recover \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform, under proper conditions, uniquely represents its time-domain function, allowing for the exact recovery of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) via the inverse Laplace Transform, provided \\\\(z(t)\\\\) adheres to the needed conditions like continuity and exponential boundedness.",
