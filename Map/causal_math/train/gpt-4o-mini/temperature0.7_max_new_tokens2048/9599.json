  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The function is subjected to the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-s^2} f(s) ds \\\\). Analyze the implications of applying this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = z^3 + 1 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention prior to applying \\\\( g(f) \\\\), will the output of \\\\( g \\\\)(\\\\( f \\\\circ h \\\\)) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f \\\\) without considering the influence of \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will alter the input to the transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\), meaning that the output will not only depend on \\\\( f \\\\) but also on the applied function \\\\( h \\\\). The new function changes the behavior of \\\\( f \\\\) across the integration domain, influencing the final outcome.",
