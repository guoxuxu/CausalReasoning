  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential, \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 \\\\psi + V(x) \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is the potential energy function. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\\\hbar} \\\\), where H is a Hamiltonian operator.\n\nCan we deduce the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\), the initial state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) could have been any state that, when transformed and evolved, results in the observed \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\). Multiple potential initial states could evolve to the same final state, especially without knowing the action of \\\\( U(t) \\\\).",
