  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Mx \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven a solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that satisfies \\\\( AMx = b \\\\), can it be conclusively inferred that the original system was \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( Mx \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) was applied, it is uncertain whether \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solves the original system \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) or the modified system \\\\( AMx = b \\\\). The presence of M alters the solution set unless its effect is specifically neutral with respect to A's solution space.",
