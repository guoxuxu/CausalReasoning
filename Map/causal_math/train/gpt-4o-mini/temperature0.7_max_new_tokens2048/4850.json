  "Problem": "Analyze a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied on an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) within a linear system governed by \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\). The concern here is how transformations and external interventions affect the evolution of the system over time.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the application of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely inferred from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) since multiple initial conditions can lead to the same endpoint, especially due to differences in frequency and phase modifications.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial state z_0 and the function e^{iωt} both influence the state z(T) at time T. The state z(T) can be used to determine the initial state z_0, but this determination is dependent on knowing whether e^{iωt} was applied. Additionally, the derivative of z, denoted as dot{z}, is affected by both z_0 and e^{iωt}, indicating that changes in the initial state or the function both impact the evolution of the system.",
