  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable z, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The question examines the sensitivity of the integral transformation under varying parameters.\n\nIf the parameter s is increased, resulting in a shift from s to \\\\( s+\\\\delta \\\\), without any other intervention, will there be any change in the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in s makes the exponential decay faster, effectively weighting the integral more towards the lower values of t. This results in a change in the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), altering the output of the integral transformation.",
