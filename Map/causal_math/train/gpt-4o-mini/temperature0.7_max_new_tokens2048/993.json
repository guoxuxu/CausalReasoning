  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. We examine the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) to the system, where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) without further interventions, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any t > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) modifies the initial state by a multiplicative factor that evolves with time, changing the trajectory of the system from what would be produced by the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\).",
