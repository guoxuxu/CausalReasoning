  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( t \\) represents time. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\( F(z) \\) which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into its frequency components \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\nGiven the final modified signal at time \\( T \\), can we determine the exact nature of interventions (original transformations or inverse transformations) used by only analyzing the signal at \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Analyzing the signal at time \\( T \\) provides limited information, mainly reflecting the cumulative effect of both the original and any inverse transformations. The overlap in potential effects from different transformations makes it impossible to uniquely discern the interventions applied solely based on the final signal characteristics.",
