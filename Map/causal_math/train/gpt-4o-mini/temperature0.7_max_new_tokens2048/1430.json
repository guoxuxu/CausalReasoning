  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\\\( u' = Du \\\\), where D is a linear operator acting on a vector space V. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation, defined by the operator \\\\( T(u) = Evu \\\\), where E is a matrix and v is a scalar, and then examining the system's response over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine the original pre-transformation state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( T(u) \\\\), it is impossible to backtrack accurately to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) since the transformation could have altered \\( u_0 \\) in a way that is not reversible using only the information of \\( u(T) \\) under the evolution \\\\( u' = Du \\\\).",
