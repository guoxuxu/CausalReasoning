  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation using a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). This transformed signal is then filtered through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), impacting the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed and then passed through the system with transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the resultant output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) on the original signal without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform modifies the input signal spectrum, and the interaction with \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) further alters this spectrum. Since \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) typically enhances or diminishes certain frequencies, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depends heavily on the transformed version of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) rather than its original form.",
