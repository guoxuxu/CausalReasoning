  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\), where A is a 2x2 constant matrix. Observe the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Px\\\\), where P is a constant invertible 2x2 matrix, and its effects on the solutions.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Qx\\\\), where Q is another constant invertible matrix, is applied as an intervention at some intermediate time t_1, will the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the matrix A and not on P or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(x)\\\\) adds another layer of complexity, modifying the system's state with \\\\(Qx(t_1)\\\\). Accordingly, the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) is determined by A, P, and Q due to their combined effects influencing the trajectory from these modified initial conditions.",
