  "Problem": "Imagine a physical system that can be modeled by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a region. Consider interventions performed using a boundary condition modification where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) on part of the boundary is altered using a function \\\\(h(t, x)\\\\), which is timedependent.\n\nIf the boundary condition is set to a fixed function \\\\(h(0, x)\\\\) and no further interventions are made, will the solution \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) at a later time t depend only on the initial boundary condition \\\\(h(0,x)\\\\) and not on time?",
  "Explanation": "Since no further boundary interventions occur and the equation is time-independent (Laplace's equation), the solution \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) in the domain will remain static after its initial determination from \\\\(h(0, x)\\\\). The solution follows from the initial boundary condition and isn't affected by time.",
