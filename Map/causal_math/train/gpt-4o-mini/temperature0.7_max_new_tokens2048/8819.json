  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system described by a Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) defined as \\\\(f(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(s) e^{ist} ds\\\\). The scenario explores how manipulations to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) affect the outcome of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over an interval.\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( g(s) \\\\) at a specific frequency \\\\( s_0 \\\\) by introducing a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\lambda s} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\lambda > 0 \\\\), will this change be evident in \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping exponential factor at a specific frequency modifies the spectrum of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) resulting in an altered transformation that affects both the amplitude decay and phase shift of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) related to that frequency. This change is visible in the output.",
