  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) evolving in time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined as \\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex \\( s \\), is analyzed.\n\nSuppose at a time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z(t) = e^{i\\beta t}z(t_1) \\) (introducing a new frequency \\( \\beta \\)). Will \\( T(z) \\) at \\( s \\) afterwards depend strictly on \\( \\omega \\) rather than \\( \\beta \\) or \\( z(t_1) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\), incorporating effects of \\( \\beta \\) and the state at \\( t_1 \\). Since \\( T(z) \\) integrates over all times, both pre- and post-intervention dynamics (i.e., influenced by \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\beta \\)) will contribute to the outcome, affecting the integral transform result.",
