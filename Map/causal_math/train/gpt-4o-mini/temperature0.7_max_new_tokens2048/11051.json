  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( r(x) = e^{-bx^2} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant different from \\\\( a \\\\)) is applied as an intervention to \\\\( q(x) \\\\), will the new Fourier transform at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the Fourier transforms of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or include influences from both \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( r(x) \\\\) adds another Gaussian modification, resulting in a function \\\\( s(x) = r(x)q(x) = e^{-bx^2}e^{-ax^2}h(x) \\\\). The convolution principles apply, affecting the Fourier transform of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) with both modifications \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\) includes influences of both transforming functions.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(x) modifies p(x), which influences the Fourier transform of p(x). Additionally, h(x) affects its own Fourier transform. When r(x) is applied, it also modifies q(x), and both p(x) and r(x) contribute to the Fourier transform of q(x). Therefore, the Fourier transform of q(x) at any time t > t1 will depend on the influences from both p(x) and r(x), not just h(x).",
