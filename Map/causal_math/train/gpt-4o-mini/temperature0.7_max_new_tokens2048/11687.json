  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\\\) where A is a matrix and v is a complex constant vector. The system is then subjected to a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\) (where C is another matrix) is imposed at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will this intervention leave the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) unaffected for all times t > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by an additional exponential factor related to the matrix C, impacting how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves past \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and thus altering the outcome of \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). The frequency domain representation will reflect these changes, showing dependencies on both A and C.",
