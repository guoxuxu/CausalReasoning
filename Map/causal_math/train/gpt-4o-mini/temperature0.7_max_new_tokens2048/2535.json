  "Problem": "Consider complex function \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\lambda z}\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine how integral transformations, specifically Laplace Transform, modify this function and impact the final output when the independent variable \\\\(z\\\\)'s real part changes.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega z)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number, is multiplied to \\\\(g(z)\\\\) before applying Laplace Transform, will the resulting poles of \\\\(H(s)\\\\) be affected by both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(z)\\\\) modifies the original function to \\\\(g(z)h(z) = e^{\\\\lambda z}\\\\cos(\\\\omega z)\\\\). The Laplace Transform of this product leads to a more complex expression where poles and behavior of \\\\(H(s)\\\\) depend on both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), indicating the combined effect of these parameters on the transformed function.",
