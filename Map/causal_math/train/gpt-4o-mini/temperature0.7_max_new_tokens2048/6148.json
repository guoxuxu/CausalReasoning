  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation under the action of a linear operator defined by \\\\( L[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw \\), where the operation is along a path in the complex plane.\n\nAfter observing the result of \\\\( L[g](z) \\\\) from the intervention, can we determine the specific nature of the intervention (i.e., the value of c) knowing that the original function was \\\\( z^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral result and knowing the original form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we can back-calculate to find the coefficient c. The modification by a scalar multiplication in the complex plane is traceable since it scales the entire function in a predictable way, thus allowing the specific intervention to be identified.",
