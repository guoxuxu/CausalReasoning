  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. We investigate how the function affects solutions to the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\), where M is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at z = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at z = Z be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to z = Z under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition to \\\\( f(0) w_0 = e^{K*0}w_0 = w_0 \\\\), however, the character of the progression for any \\\\( z \\neq 0 \\\\) alters as \\\\( e^{Kz} \\\\) non-trivially affects the evolutionary path due to non-commutativity of matrix exponentiation with M differential operator, thereby altering what \\\\( w(z) \\\\) would have been without such an application.",
