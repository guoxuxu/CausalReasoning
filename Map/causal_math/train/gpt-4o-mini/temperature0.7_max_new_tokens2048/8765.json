  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapped to a vector field by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is studied on the plane transformed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( z \\\\) evolves under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for a period \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) changes the trajectory in the complex plane. Depending on the power \\\\( n \\\\), this warps the space differently, affecting how \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\) acts subsequently. For example, exponentiation and rotations induced by \\\\( z^n \\\\) can lead to different final states under \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
