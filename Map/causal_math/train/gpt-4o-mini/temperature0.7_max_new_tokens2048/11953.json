  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( g(z) \\) defined on the complex plane as \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number. The function is studied under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) which transforms \\( g(t) \\) from the time domain to the complex \\( s \\)-domain.\n\nCan the original parameter \\( c \\) be correctly deduced by observing the transformed function \\( G(s) \\) without any additional information about the function form or prior intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-c} \\), the pole of the function in the \\( s \\)-domain clearly indicates the value of \\( c \\). This allows back-solving for \\( c \\) uniquely from \\( G(s) \\) without ambiguity, ensuring accurate deduction of the cause (parameter \\( c \\)) from the effect (transformed function).",
