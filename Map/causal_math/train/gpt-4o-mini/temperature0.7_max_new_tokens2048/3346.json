  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i \\\\theta}z\\\\) acts on a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) in the complex plane. Here, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a real number representing a rotation angle. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\) for dynamics given by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant, is considered.\n\nObserving \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can it be definitely stated whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The effect at \\\\(t = T\\\\), a position on the complex circle, could be reached by numerous initial conditions and rotations. Without exact information on \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) or the initial position \\\\(z_0\\\\), the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) cannot be conclusively determined.",
