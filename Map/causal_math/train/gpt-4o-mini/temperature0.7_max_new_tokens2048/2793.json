  "Problem": "Consider the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\\\) over a closed contour C in the complex plane, where a and w are constants, and w lies inside C. This transformation explores the impact of parameter 'a' on function behavior around singular point w.\n\nIf 'a' in the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is increased, does this directly enhance the magnitude of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for a fixed w?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'a' would effectively increase the exponential growth of the numerator \\\\( e^{az} \\\\), which in turn enhances the overall magnitude of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), especially due to the exponential factor dominating any contributions from the pole at z = w.",
