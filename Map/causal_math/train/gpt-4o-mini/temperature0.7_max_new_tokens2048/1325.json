  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) (squaring) is applied first and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) (exponential function) to a complex number z, will the outcome \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) at point z equal to directly applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on z without squaring?",
  "Explanation": "The squaring function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the input for the exponential function significantly. The function \\\\( e^{iz^2} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) represent vastly different transformations; squaring affects the rate and nature of oscillations in the complex exponential.",
