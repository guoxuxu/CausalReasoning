  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The function undergoes a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, at some point in time.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's not possible to conclusively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could have modified the initial state in a complex (involving both magnitude and phase change) way that cannot be uniquely reconstructed from the final state alone.",
