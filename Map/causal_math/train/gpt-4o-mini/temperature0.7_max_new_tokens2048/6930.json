  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region undergoing a heat transfer process modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T + S(x,y,z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(T\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term depending on position and time. An intervention is introduced by applying a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied, the alteration introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\) could obscure the true initial state. Since this term decays over time, its influence at later times might not be significant, making it challenging to infer the exact initial conditions.",
