  "Problem": "In the context of function analysis, consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial conditions and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. The effect of varying \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf a transformation represented by matrix \\\\( C \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), making the new equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Ct}y \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), will this change the spectrum of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at every frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the original dynamics from \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( C \\\\) affecting \\\\( y \\\\). This modification will alter the corresponding component in the Fourier transform across all frequencies, as the transformation introduces a completely new set of dynamical behaviors that affect how \\\\( y \\\\) contributes to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
