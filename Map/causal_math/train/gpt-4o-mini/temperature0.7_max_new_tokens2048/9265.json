  "Problem": "Consider the balance of a linear mechanical system with mass, spring, and damper. The governing differential equation is \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} + c\\\\dot{x} + kx = 0 \\\\), where m is mass, c is damping coefficient, k is spring constant, and x is displacement.\n\nIf the system starts at rest with initial conditions \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(0) = 0 \\\\), and evolves naturally according to the given differential equation, will the displacement at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be affected by a change in damping coefficient \\\\( c \\\\) but not the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time is influenced directly by its initial conditions as well as the parameters m, c, and k. A change in c affects the system's damping behavior, but the outcome at any time \\\\( t \\\\) still fundamentally depends on the initial conditions set.",
