  "Problem": "Let's consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) + Nu(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the state vector, \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is the control input vector, M is a constant state matrix, and N is a control matrix. We assess the effect of a transformation represented as \\\\(h(x) = e^{Kt}x\\\\), where K is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial state vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0 and the system proceeds under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\) without any external control (\\\\(u(t)=0\\\\)) till time T, will \\\\(x(T)\\\\) be equivalent to evolving \\\\(x_0\\\\) directly to time T under the same conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Implementing the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) modifies the initial state by the factor \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\). Because the nature of the matrix exponentials \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\) may shift the trajectory non-trivially compared to the untouched trajectory from just the matrix M, the system's state at time T would generally differ from the untransformed evolution.",
