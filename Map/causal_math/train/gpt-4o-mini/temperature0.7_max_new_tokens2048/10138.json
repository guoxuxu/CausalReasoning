  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit that involves a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) in series connected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The relationship between the current (I) and the voltage (V) across the circuit can be modeled using a differential equation \\\\( V - L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} - RI = 0 \\\\). We are also interested in the impact of a Laplace Transform on this differential equation.\n\nCan we determine the exact original voltage waveform V(t) by observing the current I(t) at all times t > 0 without knowing the initial conditions of I?",
  "Explanation": "Since the voltage could include a transient component that does not leave a traceable impact in the steady-state current, and due to potential initial inductor currents affecting early timesteps uniquely, falling outside observable impacts, the exact initial V(t) cannot always be determined.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The AC voltage source causes the voltage V across the circuit, which in turn causes the current I to flow. The current I affects both the inductor L and the resistor R, and the voltage V also influences the rate of change of current dI/dt. Additionally, the current I can be transformed using a Laplace Transform, which allows for the analysis of the original voltage waveform V(t) from the current I(t).",
