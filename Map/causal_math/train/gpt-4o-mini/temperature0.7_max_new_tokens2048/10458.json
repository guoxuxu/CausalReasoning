  "Problem": "In the examination of a physical system governed by the wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\), where c is the wave speed, consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) applied to u(x, t) and its properties across time and space.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial wave profile \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) by observing the evolved wave profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) and applying the inverse Fourier transform without knowing that the Fourier transform was used during process evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Given the evolved wave profile at t = T, the inverse Fourier transform can be applied to \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) to obtain \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) in the frequency domain. By applying the known reversal properties of the wave transformations under the Fourier domain (adjusting for phase shifts and amplitudes), it is entirely feasible to retrace back to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) and thus accurately determine the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).",
