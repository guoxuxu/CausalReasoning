  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which converts the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) into its frequency components \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filtering operation that modifies specific frequencies is applied, will the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 strictly depend only on \\\\( L(u) \\\\) and not the specifics of the filter applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a filtering operation modifies specific frequency components which ultimately shape the resulting waveform and its evolution, making the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) dependent on the nature of the filter as well as the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\).",
