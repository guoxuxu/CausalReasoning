  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing oscillations. The impact of Laplace transformation on this function is to be analyzed, where the Laplace transform is defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is known, and then allowed to transform under Laplace transformation without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) uniquely determine the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, when it exists, is a unique representation of the function in the frequency domain. Hence, if the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is known, it uniquely determines the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the conditions of transform's existence and invertibility.",
