  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}t^z \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. The integral is an example of a complex function involving a Mellin transform.\n\nCan the original parameter s be determined after applying an intervention that shifts s by a known constant c by only analyzing the modified integral?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the intervention, the determination of the original s can be complex. The resulting behavior of the integral post-intervention depends on both the original s and c, making it difficult to isolate s without additional information.",
