  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) in a potentially modified basis, can we conclusively establish what transformations (whether \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) could result from different sequences or types of basis changes and interventions. Since basis transformations and matrix multiplications may not be uniquely reversible or deducible just from the endpoint, it's impossible to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied.",
