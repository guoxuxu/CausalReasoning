  "Problem": "Consider the mathematical system where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real number, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z(t) + e^{iBt} \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another frequency, is applied midway in the observation period, will the resultant Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) only reflect the initial frequency \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at any point adds a new frequency component \\\\( B \\\\) to the system. The resulting Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) will subsequently exhibit peaks not only at \\\\( A \\\\) but also distinctly at \\\\( B \\\\), reflecting the composite nature of the signal post-intervention.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the complex function z(t) is determined by the differential equation, where the real number A directly influences the rate of change of z(t). The Fourier transform F(z) is obtained from z(t), and thus is influenced by the evolution governed by A. The transformation G(z) adds a new frequency component B to z(t), affecting the resultant Fourier transform F(z). Hence, both A and B influence the Fourier transform, implying it will not only reflect the initial frequency A.",
