  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\). We explore the effect of a convolution operation where \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another time-domain function and the corresponding Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as defined undergoes Laplace transformation, will \\\\( G(s) \\\\), the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), exactly equal the product of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem for Laplace transforms states that the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions equals the product of their individual transforms. Thus, we have \\\\( G(s) = F(s) \\\\cdot H(s) \\).",
