  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor having capacitance C described by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\\\omega^2 q = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q\\\\) is the charge on the capacitor and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. Investigate the transformation of the system state when subjected to an external sinusoidal voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nGiven the charge on the capacitor \\\\(q(t)\\\\) at a later time t, can we deduce the original amplitude \\\\(V_0\\\\) of the voltage source without other information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) alone, without information about initial conditions or system damping, does not suffice to determine the amplitude \\\\(V_0\\\\) uniquely. The amplitude of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) also depends on the damping and initial conditions, which aren't specified.",
