  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ky \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant linking \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and another independent real-valued function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\\\alpha y \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a positive decay constant. We analyze the impact of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the transformation by \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), which might have altered the initial conditions, cannot be reversed or traced back uniquely due to its dependency on constant \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",
