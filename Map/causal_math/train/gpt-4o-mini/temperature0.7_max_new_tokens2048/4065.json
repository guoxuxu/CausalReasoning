  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real frequency. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) scales the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) at every point in time. This modification affects the trajectory of the complex function, leading to a difference in the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( T \\\\), compared to just evolving it under \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\).",
