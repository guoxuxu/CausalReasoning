  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number.\n\nIf an initial transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another constant complex number) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) changes the initial state. As a result, the resultant trajectory will differ from the one originating purely from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), unless C and D commute in specific cases where their effects exclusively cancel out.",
