  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the state of the system and c is a constant wave speed. Consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx \\\\).\n\nAssuming \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) is observed and knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at t = 0, can we deterministically backtrack to precisely deduce \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear characteristics of both the PDE and the Fourier transform, if the application of \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is known, one can uniquely invert using the inverse Fourier transform and solve the transport equation backwards (by reversing the wave speed c) to exactly recover \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\).",

The application of the Fourier transform, F(u), allows us to relate u(x,T) back to u(x,0) and also provides information about u(x,0) directly. The wave speed c affects the state of the system over time, u(x,t).",
