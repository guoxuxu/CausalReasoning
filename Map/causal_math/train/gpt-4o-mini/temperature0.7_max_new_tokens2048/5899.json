  "Problem": "A system is defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves over time according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the system's behavior under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB(t-s)}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\) where B is another real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a second transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{iC(t_1-s)}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\) (where C is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 only depend on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) involve integral operations with exponential terms, the combined effects of A, B, and C all influence the trajectory and the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), due to the nature of the transformations adding up and interacting dynamically.",
