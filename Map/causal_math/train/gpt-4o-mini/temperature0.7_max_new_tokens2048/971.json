  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = \\log(z(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\log \\\\) denotes the complex logarithm. Consider the effects of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a new transformation \\\\( S(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants), will the final state of \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the original transformation \\\\( T \\\\) irrespective of \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional changes to the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which in turn affects \\\\( w(t) \\\\). The composite impact of both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), along with their potential non-commutativity, influences the subsequent trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) up to time \\\\( T \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is influenced by time t, and its value is determined by the angular frequency ω. The transformation T(z) affects the state of w(T), which is derived from z(t). The linear transformation S(z) is independent of T(z) but is also capable of influencing w(T). Therefore, the final state of w(T) after t_1 is not determined solely by T(z) if S(z) is applied.",
