  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nConsidering the system's final state at \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(T,x)]\\\\), is it possible to deduce which filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(k)\\\\) was applied at t_1, given the frequency-domain data only?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific filter used requires more information than just the endpoint frequencies, due to potential equivalencies in the transformation effects of different filters. Multiple different filters can lead to comparable modifications in the state's evolution, resulting in indistinguishable end states from frequency-domain data alone.",
