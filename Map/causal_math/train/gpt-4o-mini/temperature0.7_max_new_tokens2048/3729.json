  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, transformed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAt} z \\\\) over time t, where A is a real constant. This represents a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the result is then allowed to evolve under the identity transformation (i.e., no change) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be different from the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAt} z \\\\) represents a rotation by an angle \\\\( At \\\\) in the complex plane, the state at time T, \\\\( e^{iAT} z_0 \\\\), represents z rotated by AT radians, which is generally different from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unless A or T is zero or multiples of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\).",
