  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = M u\\\\), where M is a matrix giving the linear transformation on vector \\\\(u\\\\). We investigate the effects of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( g(u) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)u +\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)u \\\\), with a constant \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), over time interval t.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), reconstructing the original \\\\( u_0 \\\\) becomes challenging as the observed \\\\( u(t) \\\\) could either be a direct result of the evolution under M or modified initially by the oscillatory function \\\\( g(u) \\\\), affecting its trajectory in a non-trivial way.",
