  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the equation of motion is derived from the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + v(x) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is momentum, \\\\( m \\\\) is mass, and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is a potential energy function. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to the position function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nUsing only the knowledge of the waveform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine whether the perturbation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied and what its nature was (i.e., magnitude of \\\\( \\\\delta x \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The observable \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at time T, even if different from expected, does not uniquely define the nature of any interventions due to potential overlaps in how different states could evolve under the Hamiltonian to produce similar or the same Fourier Transforms at time T.",
