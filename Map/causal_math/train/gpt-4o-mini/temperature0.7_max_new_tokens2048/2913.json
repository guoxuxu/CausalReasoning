  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function transformation on real function space, considering the integral transform \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\). The analysis focuses on the Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf performing a Fourier transform on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( F(a)(x) = \\\\frac{1}{a + ix} \\\\), will applying the transform on the same \\\\( f(t) \\\\) always yield the same output if there is no intervention in the system?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) being deterministic and depend solely on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) under constant conditions of \\\\( a \\\\) and without any external intervention maintains consistent results.",
