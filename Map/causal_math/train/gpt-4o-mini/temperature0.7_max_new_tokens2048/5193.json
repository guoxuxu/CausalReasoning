  "Problem": "Consider a vector-valued function z(t) defined in a complex domain and governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), where M is a 2x2 matrix. An integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Mt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied. The transformation is modified by a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\) without additional transformations, will \\( T(z)(t) \\) at t = T be equivalent to directly computing \\( T(z)(t) \\) from \\( z_0 \\) without applying \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( f(z) \\) alters the initial vector by a phase factor which scales and rotates the vector in the complex plane. This modification affects how the vector evolves over time under \\( M \\) and subsequently changes the results of the integral transformation \\( T(z) \\).",
