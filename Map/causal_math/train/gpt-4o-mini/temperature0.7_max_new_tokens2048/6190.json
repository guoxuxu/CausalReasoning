  "Problem": "Consider the analytical solution of the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) under initial conditions that can be represented as a Fourier transform. An operation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we determine the original initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at some time t without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to reliably separate the contributions of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and the added \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) term from the observed temperature distribution, because both evolve under the same heat equation but could form indistinguishable effects depending on their specific forms and the properties of the evolution.",
