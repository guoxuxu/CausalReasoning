  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. A transformation involving a complex function \\\\(f(z) = Re(z^2)\\\\), where \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), is applied, influencing the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is used to set initial boundary conditions for the domain at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the system evolves according to Laplace's equation without further intervention, will the potential function \\\\(u(x, y, t)\\\\) at some later time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if the original, untransformed boundary conditions were used?",
  "Explanation": "The boundary transformation by \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the initial potential distribution, which influences the solution to Laplace's equation throughout the domain. The resultant potential function \\\\(u\\\\) differs because Laplace's equation is sensitive to boundary conditions.",
