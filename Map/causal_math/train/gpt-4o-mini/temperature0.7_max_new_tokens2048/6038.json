  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) denote the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\) respectively. The system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. Let us explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z(t)) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nBy examining \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\), can we conclusively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, assuming the dynamics are known?",
  "Explanation": "The inclusion of the complex exponential in the Fourier transform obscures the direct tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to integral transformations mixing the temporal information over all t, especially because of the constant term B influencing the evolution at each point.",
