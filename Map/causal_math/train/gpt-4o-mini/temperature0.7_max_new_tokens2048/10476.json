  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the set of complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\), and let's consider an integral transformation of this function, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result of the processed function after applications of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine precisely what functions were used and their parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform does not retain all information about the sequence or types of operations that led to it because of overlapping effects from powers and shifts. Multiple different sequences of operations can lead to indistinguishable results in the frequency domain.",
