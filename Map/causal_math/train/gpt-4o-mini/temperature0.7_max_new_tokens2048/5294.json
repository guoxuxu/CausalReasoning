  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nGiven the spectrum resulting from the Fourier Transform of a function, can we infer the exact time-domain representation of the signal specifically determined whether the signal was \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), assuming no prior information on phase or amplitude modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform provides the frequency components and their magnitudes but losses specific phase information unless specifically preserved. Multiple time-domain signals could have the same magnitude spectrum, making it impossible to uniquely determine the function \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without additional phase information.",
