  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) for a matrix M.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, could we uniquely infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information about the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) means the initial state might have been transformed by M, thus affecting the dynamics. Since M can modify state vectors in a way that isn't necessarily reversible just by examining \\\\( x(T) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
