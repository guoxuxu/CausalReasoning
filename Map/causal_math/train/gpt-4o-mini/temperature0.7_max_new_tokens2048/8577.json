  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential V(x) in one dimension governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) \\\\). We investigate the effect of a linear transformation of the momentum variable \\\\( p \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(p) = ap \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nIf \\\\( g(p) \\\\) is applied to the momentum \\\\( p_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the Hamiltonian \\\\( H \\\\) without further intervention, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( p_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( H \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(p) = ap \\\\) changes the initial momentum, which affects the kinetic energy term \\\\( \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} \\\\) in the Hamiltonian, leading to a different trajectory and thus a different position \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
