  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^s ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter representing time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an operation modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z^2 \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) remain unaffected by the early transformation of \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z^2 \\\\) influences the integrand, fundamentally changing the course of the integral due to the alteration in the powers of \\\\( z \\\\). This significantly impacts the resulting function's properties and values at any later time.",
