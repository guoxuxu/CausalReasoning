  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions related to the real and imaginary parts of a complex function subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the initial conditions of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) are doubled at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve without any intervention, will the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for the modified system at s = a (where a is a constant) be twice that of the original system's transform at the same point?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the initial conditions of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) directly scales the entire function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by 2. Given the linearity of the Laplace transform, this results in \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) also being scaled by a factor of 2 for any s, including s = a.",
