  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze how the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{zt} dz \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter, affects the output.\n\nIf a corrective term \\\\( h(z) = z + p \\\\) (where \\\\( p \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and both functions \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) affect the system, will the outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (T > t_1) depend on the original parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds a complex constant \\\\( p \\\\) to \\\\( z \\\\), changing the trajectory and outcomes even after applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The final output relies on the interaction of \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\), and the introduced constant \\\\( p \\\\), altering the complexity of the dependency.",
