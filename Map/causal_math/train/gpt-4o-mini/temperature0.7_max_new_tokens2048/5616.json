  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where t represents time. Consider further the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), defined for complex s where Re(s) > 0.\n\nHaving observed the transformed \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after applying an unknown damping factor, can we precisely identify both the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with complete knowledge of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), recovering both the damping factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the exact form of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be highly non-trivial. Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and perturbations in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could lead to the same or very similar \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), especially given the complexity introduced by damping in the time-to-frequency domain transformation.",
