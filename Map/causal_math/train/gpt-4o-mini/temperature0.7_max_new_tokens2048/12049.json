  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) that represents a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which undergoes a transformation given by the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\). We examine how this transformation affects the causal relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\), can we unambiguously recover \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\) can be applied to recover \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\). The process is unambiguous for this class of functions as the transformation is one-to-one and onto for functions of this nature.",
