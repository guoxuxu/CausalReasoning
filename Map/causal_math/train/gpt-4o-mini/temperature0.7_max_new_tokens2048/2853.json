  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral in the complex plane. We will evaluate the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt}dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed path and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number parameter. The analysis is affected by transformations using the function \\\\( f(z) = z^{2} + a \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied on all points along contour \\\\( C \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the integral \\\\( I \\\\) is evaluated without further alterations, will the result of the integral \\\\( I \\\\) be the same as without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the contour \\\\( C \\\\) using \\\\( f(z) \\\\) results in a new contour with potentially different properties (such as moving poles or altering residues). This alteration will likely change the result of the integral \\\\( I \\\\), since the integral's value can be sensitive to these transformations.",
