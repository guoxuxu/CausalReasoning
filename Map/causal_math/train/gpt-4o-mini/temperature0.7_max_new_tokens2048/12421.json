  "Problem": "In a stochastic process, the change in a variable X is governed by the differential equation \\\\( dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is the drift coefficient, \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is the volatility coefficient, and \\\\( dW_t \\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We study how the application of a transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) impacts the process over time.\n\nObserving \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original variable \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) was applied during its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) was applied, it could lead to large discrepancies between the potential values of \\\\( X_0 \\\\). Multiple values of \\\\( X_0 \\\\) could square to the same number, creating ambiguity. Therefore, without certainty about the application of \\\\( h(X) \\\\), \\\\( X_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the observed \\\\( X(t) \\\\).",
