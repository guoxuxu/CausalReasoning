  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with M being a linear operator. An external force applies a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + k\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where k and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, acting on the state vector \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the sin term, although initially zero, could affect the trajectory in a way that is indistinguishable without knowing it was applied, especially if \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and T align such that the sin term substantially modifies the state during evolution.",
