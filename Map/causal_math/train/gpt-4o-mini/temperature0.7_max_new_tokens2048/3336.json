  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) applied to elements in the complex plane. We analyze the effects of performing a linear transformation on z via a matrix M before and after applying the function.\n\nGiven the final result after applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), and intervention \\\\(N\\\\), can we determine accurately whether \\\\(M\\\\) or \\\\(N\\\\) was applied first?",
  "Explanation": "The result of non-commutative matrix multiplication could produce different outcomes depending on the order of application. Without explicit knowledge of the intervention sequence, one cannot accurately backtrack to the order of operations from the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

Specifically, z directly causes f(z), and M can directly transform z before it is input into f, while N can also transform its own input before being applied to f.",
