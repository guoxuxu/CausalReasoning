  "Problem": "Let us consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) represents a control input vector. The Laplace transform \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) applied to this system results in \\( X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + (sI - A)^{-1}x(0) \\) where \\( U(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\( X(s) \\) at any \\( s \\), can we uniquely determine the original system's initial state \\( x(0) \\) without knowing the control input \\( U(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\( x(0) \\) from \\( X(s) \\) alone is impossible without explicit knowledge of \\( U(s) \\) because both the initial state and the control input influence \\( X(s) \\). Without knowing \\( U(s) \\), the contribution of \\( (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) \\) is indeterminable, thus obscuring \\( x(0) \\).",
