  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the impact of the Fourier Transform and its inverse defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( F^{-1}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed using Fourier Transform at t = 0, and further evolved with its dynamics under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) without any additional intervention, will the transformed state at t = T match the Fourier Transform of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) directly applied at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform alters the frequency components of the signal, and additional evolution under \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) will shift and potentially dampen or amplify these components differently than if it were applied directly at t = T. Thus, the sequence and timing of application affect the final state.",
