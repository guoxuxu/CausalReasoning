  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\\\). This transformation is applied to a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int h(x) K(x, s) dx \\\\). Investigate the effects of the transformations and their reversibility across different conditions.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) be precisely inferred from \\\\( g(s) \\\\) without any modification or additional transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the lossy nature of the transformation caused by the smoothing effect of the Gaussian kernel, \\\\( g(s) \\\\) does not retain all the information needed to uniquely determine \\\\( h(x) \\\\). Precise inference of the original function is, thus, not possible.",
