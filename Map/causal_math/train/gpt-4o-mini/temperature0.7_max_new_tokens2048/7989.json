  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which represents a unit circle in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer, on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0, and the function is allowed to evolve naturally, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the complex plane still represent a unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) results in \\\\( z(t) = (e^{it})^n = e^{int} \\\\). This alters the frequency of traversal around the circle, effectively modifying the rate at which the circle is traversed but not altering the path's shape. Hence, although the path remains a circle, the changed frequency means the trajectory, in terms of time to complete one full circle, is different.",
