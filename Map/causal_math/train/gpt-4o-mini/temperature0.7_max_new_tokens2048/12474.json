  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) representing a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\\\), and how it maps the function into a complex frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\omega + \\delta)t} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform still reflect the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not the intervention \\\\( \\delta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the frequency of the signal, and this alteration will be reflected in the new Laplace transform, which becomes \\\\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i(\\omega + \\delta)} \\\\). The transform is therefore directly influenced by both the original frequency and the intervention.",
