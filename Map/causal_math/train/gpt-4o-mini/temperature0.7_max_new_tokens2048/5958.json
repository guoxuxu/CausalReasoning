  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) being constant matrices, and \\\\(u\\\\) representing control input. We investigate the effect when applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) to the state vector.\n\nCan we infer the exact form of the control \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and matrix \\\\(D\\\\) by analyzing \\\\(X(s)\\\\) alone, after transformation and system evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformed state \\\\(X(s)\\\\) encodes information in the frequency domain, which lacks direct indications of time-domain specifics such as control actions and the dynamics reflected in \\\\(D\\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) might yield similar \\\\(X(s)\\\\), making exact inference unfeasible.",
