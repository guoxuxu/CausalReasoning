  "Problem": "Consider a linear operation in a vector space described by the integral transform \\\\( H(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(t) x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a transformation function. We study the effect of applying a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined by \\\\( D[x(t)] = \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nConsidering the output \\\\( H(x(t)) \\\\), can we determine if the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before transforming, without previous knowledge about \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), the result \\\\( H(x(t)) \\\\) does not uniquely indicate whether a derivative was taken. Multiple distinct functions can yield similar transformed results, obscuring the effect of \\\\( D \\\\).",
