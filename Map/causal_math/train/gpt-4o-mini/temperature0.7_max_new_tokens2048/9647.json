  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a specific time \\( t_1 \\) where a new function \\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\) (with D being a different constant matrix) is used, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) only depend on M and not on \\( \\omega \\) or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\( g(x) \\) adds another level of complexity to the system's dynamics. The final state \\( x(T) \\) depends on the interplay between M, \\( \\omega \\), and D. The matrix exponential transformations introduce factors that significantly influence the trajectory and the resultant state at time T.",
