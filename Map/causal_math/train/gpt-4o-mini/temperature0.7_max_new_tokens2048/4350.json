  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) on the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real, positive constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The impact of transforming the system using \\\\( z(t) x(t) \\\\) is studied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nUpon observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) after it has evolved, is it possible to determine the initial function \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely without knowing if the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely derived because the observed \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could be modified by the phase and magnitude changes of the complex exponential, verifying its application is crucial.",
