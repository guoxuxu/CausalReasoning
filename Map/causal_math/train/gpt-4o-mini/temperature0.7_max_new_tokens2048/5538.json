  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis problem where the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is transformed using an integral along a contour \\\\( C \\\\). The contour \\\\( C \\\\) is specified to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Assume that the variable transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to modify the path of integration.\n\nCan we infer the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) after observing the integral value over the transformed path \\\\( h(z)(C) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), deducing the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) solely based on the integral result is ambiguous. The transformed integral results could theoretically align with those from a different original contour or different function properties, especially in the absence of additional information on orientation and starting points.",
