  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), a complex exponential where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real parameter representing frequency. We inspect the behavior of this function under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) over domain \\\\( x \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( Mz(x) \\\\) (where \\\\( M \\\\) is another complex constant) at some \\\\( x = X \\\\), will \\\\( T(z(X)) \\\\) purely depend on \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), disregarding \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new endpoint \\\\( z(X) \\\\) after intervention by \\\\( M \\\\) still undergoes the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), making the outcome dependent on all parameters \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) involving \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) remains influential in determining the end state alongside the intervention effect from \\\\( M \\\\).",
