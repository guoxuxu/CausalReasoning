  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The Laplace Transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how changes in the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) influence the transformed function over the complex plane.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of a function, can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the original function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "In this specific case of exponential functions, the Laplace Transform provides a unique form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) can be directly inferred from the transform’s denominator. This allows unique determination of \\\\( a \\\\) from the Laplace Transform without requiring extra data.",
