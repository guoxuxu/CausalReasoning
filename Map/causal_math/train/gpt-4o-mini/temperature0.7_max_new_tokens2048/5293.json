  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the resulting spectrum concentrate its energy at the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is a delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\). This indicates a concentration of all the signal's energy at that particular frequency, accurately reflecting its singular frequency component.",
