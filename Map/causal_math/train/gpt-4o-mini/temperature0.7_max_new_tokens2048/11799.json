  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) evolves according to the linear time-invariant system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) an input vector. We are interested in examining the effects of implementing an input transformation \\\\(u(t) = D v(t)\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represents a new transformed input.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can we precisely determine what input transformations were used (whether \\\\(D v(t)\\\\), \\\\(E w(t)\\\\), or both), strictly by knowing the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific input transformations used by only observing \\\\(x(T)\\\\) is challenging due to the overlapping effects that the matrices B, D, and E can have on the evolution. This makes it difficult to separate and identify which transformations were applied, especially if they share similar or complementary effects on the state trajectory.",
