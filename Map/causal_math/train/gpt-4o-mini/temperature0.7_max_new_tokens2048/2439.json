  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by \\( Ax = b \\), where A is a non-singular matrix. An operator \\( T \\) defined by \\( T(x) = Ux \\) (where \\( U \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied, modifying the vector \\( x \\) in the space.\n\nIf at a certain point \\( t_1 \\), an intervention via a scaling matrix \\( V \\) (another diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied to the system, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) be representative only of the initial application \\( T \\) and not \\( V \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with scaling matrix \\( V \\) further alters the state of the system. The resultant state at time \\( T \\) depends on both the initial transformation by \\( U \\) and the later application of \\( V \\), thus reflecting the effects of both.",
