  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time, representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. An integral transformation defined as \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number is applied.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given for t = 0 and allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( w(T) \\\\), calculated directly using the transformation be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T and transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w(t) \\\\) integrates the effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, accumulating differences that arise due to the exponential multiplier \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which depends on A and the interval [0, T]. These differences are not captured by merely evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to t = T and then applying the transformation.",

The constant A influences the evolution of z(t) and therefore affects the transformation w(t). Finally, the value of w(T) is determined by the evolution of z(t) from its initial state at t=0.",
