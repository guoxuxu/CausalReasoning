  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is studied.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( S \\\\) defined by \\\\( Sz(t) = z(t) + \\\\int_0^t \\\\ln(1+s)z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be affected solely by the initial system dynamics and not by the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additive and integrative effects, such as the logarithmic integral, which together with \\\\( T \\\\) significantly modifies the trajectory and the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The direct influence of the transformations cannot be negated, marking a dependence beyond the original system dynamics.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences both its real part x(t) and imaginary part y(t). The transformation T affects the state z(T) by applying an integral transformation to z(t). The transformation S modifies the state z(t) by adding the integral of z(s) weighted by ln(1+s). The application of transformations T and S at intermediate times influences the state z(T), indicating that z(T) is affected by both transformations rather than being determined solely by the initial system dynamics.",
