  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where u and v are real functions of time and governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) over time t, where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, and the specific transformations caused by C, determining the exact initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes infeasible. The transformations could significantly obscure the initial state, particularly since C, A, and B may not commute.",
