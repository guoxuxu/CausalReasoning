  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a system's state in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If unaware of the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), one cannot uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation could alter the starting point in a way that evolution under \\\\( M \\\\) alone does not reveal.",
