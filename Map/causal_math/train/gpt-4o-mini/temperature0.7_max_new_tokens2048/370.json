  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We assess the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\) which changes the domain from spatial coordinates x to wave numbers k.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be exactly determined from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Inversion to retrieve \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) requires knowing the initial application of the Fourier transform and that it encompasses the correct forward solution under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\hat{L}\\\\hat{u} \\\\). Without this knowledge, assumptions about phase and amplitude changes induced by L over time could lead to erroneous reconstructions.",
