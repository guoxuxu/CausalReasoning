  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We are interested in understanding how the integral transforms, specifically the Laplace transform, affect this function and its causal inference.\n\nIf we modify \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) = f(z) + cos(z) \\\\) and then apply the Laplace transform, will the resulting function's transform be a direct additive result of the Laplace transforms of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) and \\\\( cos(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is linear, meaning that the transform of a sum of functions is the sum of their transforms. Thus, the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will indeed be the sum of the transforms of \\\\( e^z \\\\) and \\\\( cos(z) \\\\).",
