  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, defining a rotation in the complex plane with time. Let's study the system under a transformation specified by the operator \\\\( L \\\\) taken as a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( F[\\\\cdot] \\\\).\n\nCan we determine precisely which interventions (specific phase shifts or changes in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) were applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) only by observing the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in the spectrum can indicate modifications, the precise type of intervention cannot be uniquely determined due to the indistinguishability of phase shifts of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\) and other potential transformations that might result in the same observed spectrum at time \\\\( T \\\\). More detailed temporal analysis or additional phase information is necessary to clearly identify the specifics of the intervention.",
