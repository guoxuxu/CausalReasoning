  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a Holomorphic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane. The integral transformation is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is multiplied by a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) at t = 0 (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a non-zero constant), and then allowed to evolve and be transformed as \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformation result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) simply be scaled by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) simply scales the entire integral by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) because the linearity of the integral guarantees that \\\\( \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} \\\\alpha z(t) dt = \\\\alpha \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt = \\\\alpha Z(s) \\\\).",
