  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We consider the impact of an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\) applied to \\( z \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a real constant.\n\nIf the function \\( z(t) \\) is calculated from \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the given definition without further transformation, will the transformed state \\( T(z) \\) at t = T be the integral of the simple exponential form \\( e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the transformation \\( T(z) \\) applied to \\( z(t) \\) will be directly the integral of \\( e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) over the interval from 0 to T, following the initial definition of \\( z(t) \\).",
