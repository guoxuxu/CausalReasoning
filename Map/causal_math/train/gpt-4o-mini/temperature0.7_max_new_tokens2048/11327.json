  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves in the complex plane under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We study how the Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), affects our understanding of the system.\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by applying a phase shift \\\\( z(t) \\\\rightarrow z(t)e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint of the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a phase shift which affects the Fourier Transform output by adding a complex phase factor. The final state of the Fourier Transform will definitely depend on the value of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), altering the amplitude and phase of the resulting frequency components.",
