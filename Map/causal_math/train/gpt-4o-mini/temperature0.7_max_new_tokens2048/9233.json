  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) applied to the function u(t, x) and investigate its evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) and then applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of the Fourier transform with linear differential operators, the transformation commutes with the evolution operator. The Fourier transform of the evolved function is the same as the evolution of the Fourier transform of the initial function.",
