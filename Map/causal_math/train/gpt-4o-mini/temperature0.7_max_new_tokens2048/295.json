  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact when this function undergoes a Fourier transform over time t.\n\nIf an operation, such as multiplying by another exponential function \\\\( e^{i\\\\eta t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\eta \\\\) is a real constant, is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transform result still only show a component at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by another exponential function alters the frequency of the original function, leading to a new frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\eta \\\\). The Fourier transform of the resulting function, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\eta) t} \\\\), will show a Dirac delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\eta \\\\), not at the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
