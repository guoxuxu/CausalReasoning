  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The function is analyzed in terms of its effects on integration along a contour in the complex plane. The path of integration, \\\\( C \\\\), is defined from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) dz \\\\), can we infer the starting point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of the contour \\\\( C \\\\) without extra information about function \\\\( Z(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) dz \\\\) depends on both the path and the function \\\\( Z(z) \\\\). Without precise knowledge of \\\\( Z(z) \\\\) or the nature of \\\\( C \\\\), deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_1 \\\\) just from the integral's value is not feasible, owing to the complex transformation dynamics of \\\\( Z(z) \\\\).",
