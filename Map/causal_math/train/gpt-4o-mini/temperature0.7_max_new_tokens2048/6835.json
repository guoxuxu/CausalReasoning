  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real scalar constant, representing angular frequency in the complex plane. Study the effects of applying an integral transform \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i\\\\omega \\\\), a complex constant.\n\nIf an additional external function \\\\( w(t) = e^{iCt} \\\\), where C is another real scalar, is multiplied with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the transform \\\\( T \\\\), does the result still depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( w(t) \\\\) before applying \\\\( T \\\\) results in a new function \\\\( u(t) = e^{i( A + C )t} \\\\). The resulting transform, \\\\( T[u] = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(A + C)} \\\\), now depends on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), thus the interference from the additional function alters the relationship and introduces dependence on \\\\( C \\\\).",
