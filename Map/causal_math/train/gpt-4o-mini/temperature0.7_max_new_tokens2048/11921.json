  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( S \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the exact form of the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t=T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the integral transform \\\\( T[z] \\\\), it could substantially modify the initial conditions in a non-trivial manner. Without certainty on the application of \\\\( T[z] \\\\), predictions or reversals aiming to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be accurate, especially due to the complex interaction between \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\).",
