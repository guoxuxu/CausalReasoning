  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are harmonic functions. The transformation considered here is the complex exponential transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\).\n\nSuppose an intervention is made at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) where another complex function \\\\(h(z) = e^{bz}\\\\) is applied, does the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on a and not on b?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\(h(z) = e^{bz}\\\\) significantly alters the development path of the system post-intervention. Both parameters a and b will influence the future trajectory and endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), due to the compound effects of the transformations and the evolution under the dynamical system.",
