  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\), where V is the electric potential. A transformation under a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) (with \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) representing spatial variables) is applied.\n\nKnowing the potential V at a point inside the domain influenced by the new boundary conditions, can one infer the original boundary before applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Once the boundary condition is transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the new state of potential V doesn't uniquely determine the original boundary conditions without further information. Multiple potential functions could converge to produce the same observed potentials, particularly without knowledge of the transformation's characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
