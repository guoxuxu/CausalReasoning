  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant and u is a function of both x and t. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), is applied to u resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), where k represents the wave number in the transformed domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0 solely from observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is a linear and invertible transformation, observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) allows us to uniquely determine \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) and subsequently invert the Fourier transformation to recover \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\). This process is deterministic irrespective of the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\).",
