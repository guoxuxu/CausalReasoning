  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) in one dimension, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant representing the diffusion coefficient. We introduce the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior under various scenarios.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) = e^{-k \\\\omega^2 t} \\\\) of a function at time t, can we conclusively infer that the initial condition was \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\delta(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific form of the Fourier Transform \\\\( e^{-k \\\\omega^2 t} \\\\) is uniquely linked to the heat equation with the initial condition of a Dirac delta function centered at zero. This relationship is well-defined due to the unique properties of the solution to the heat equation with this initial condition.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The behavior of the function u(x, t) over time is influenced by its spatial characteristics, as indicated by the heat equation, which relates the change in u with respect to time to its spatial curvature. The diffusion coefficient k affects how quickly the heat diffuses, impacting the time evolution of the function. The Fourier Transform of u at time t results in an exponential decay, which can be linked to the initial condition of the function, suggesting that if the Fourier Transform is e^{-k ω^2 t}, then the initial condition was likely u(x, 0) = δ(x).",
