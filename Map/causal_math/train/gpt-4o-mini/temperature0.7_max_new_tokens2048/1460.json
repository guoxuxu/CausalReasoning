  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) in the complex plane defined by the equation \\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\), where \\( A \\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{iBs}z(s) ds \\), where \\( B \\) is another real constant.\n\nKnowing the state \\( z(T) \\) and that transformations were applied, can we determine precisely which transformations (with parameters \\( B \\) or \\( C \\) or both) were involved?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity of the integral and exponential forms, along with their dependency on real constants \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), means multiple combinations could lead to the same state \\( z(T) \\). The indistinguishability of transformation parameters from the final state alone suggests that more information or constraints are necessary to uniquely determine the applied transformations.",
