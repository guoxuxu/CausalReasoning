  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nCan we unequivocally determine the sequence or types of modulations (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or both) used before Fourier transforming, simply from observing \\\\( z'(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z'(\\\\omega) \\\\), it is not possible to distinguish specifically whether the signal was modulated by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( k(t) \\\\) or both since the resultant frequency shift could potentially be produced by several combinations of different a and b values in exponential modulation functions.",
