  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation using the matrix \\\\( L \\\\), which operates in the complex function space by multiplying with the matrix \\\\( e^{i\\omega} \\\\), an operator associated with frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\. The system is analyzed for function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( M \\\\) with another frequency matrix \\\\( e^{-i\\theta} \\\\) is applied at a point \\\\( z_1 \\\\) as an intervention, would the final form of \\\\( h(Z) \\\\) at \\\\( Z > z_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) without influence from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new frequency shift, rendering the endpoint \\\\( h(Z) \\\\) dependent not only on the initial complex growth rate \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) but also on the frequencies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\). The final expression, modulated by both transformations, incorporates effects from all these parameters.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix L transforms the function h(z) by applying the operator e^{i\\omega}, which is determined by the frequency omega. The transformation M, associated with e^{-i\\theta}, further modifies h(z) at point z1.
