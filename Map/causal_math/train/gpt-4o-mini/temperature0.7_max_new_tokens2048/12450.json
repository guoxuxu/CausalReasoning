  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of an additional operator \\( Q(D) \\) affecting \\( z(t) \\) is applied at \\( t = t_1 \\), will the final frequency response \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) be solely determined by the initial \\( P(D) \\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( Q(D) \\) introduces an additional influence on the evolution of \\( z(t) \\), affecting how \\( z(t) \\) transitions from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\). This results in a modification of the frequency spectrum at \\( T \\), making \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) dependent on both \\( P(D) \\) and \\( Q(D) \\).",
