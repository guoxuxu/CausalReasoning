  "Problem": "We examine a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is its transform in the s-domain. Consider the impact of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) which also has Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we uniquely determine the functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) used in the convolution without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) shows the product of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), it is generally impossible to uniquely factorize this product into individual transforms without further constraints or data, due to potential ambiguities in decomposing the product into original components.",
