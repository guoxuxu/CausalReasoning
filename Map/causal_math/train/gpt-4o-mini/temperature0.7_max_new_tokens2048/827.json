  "Problem": "Consider a Riemann surface defined by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\lambda t} \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is a complex constant. The function \\( T(z) = z^k \\) is used as a transformation where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( S(z) = z^m \\) (where \\( m \\) is another integer) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z'(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) still represent a clear multiple of \\( k \\) and not \\( m \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The later intervention \\( S(z) \\) applies another exponent transforming \\( z(t_1) \\) further into \\( (z(t_1))^m \\). Therefore, the path of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( t > t_1 \\) to \\( T \\) will bear the compounded effects of both \\( k \\) and \\( m \\), and thus, \\( z'(T) \\) is now a combination, essentially \\( (e^{i\\lambda T})^{km} \\), reflecting both transformations.",
