  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Fourier Transform applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, which is then subjected to operations described by a differential equation \\\\( L[g(x)] = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dx^2} - k^2g \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is subject to a transformation by another function \\\\( h(x) = xg(x) \\\\) at a specific point in time and then the differential equation is solved, will the final solution in the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) remain unaffected by this transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the original function, thus changing how it is represented in both the spatial and frequency domain. The differential equation will subsequently be operating on a different function, leading to a transformed \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\), which will reflect this change induced by \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
