  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period T.\n\nIf initially the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given without any modification, will applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at any point without further intervention change the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is a linear integral transformation involving the original function, the value at any specific time T won't be changed by applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) due to linearity and time-independence of the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\).",
