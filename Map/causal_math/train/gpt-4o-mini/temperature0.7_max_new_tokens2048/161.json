  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) in a two-dimensional space. We inquire about the impacts via transformations represented by \\\\( g(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) and subsequent linear transformations \\\\( h(x, y) = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) to a point \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) and then compute \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) over the transformed coordinates, will the resultant \\\\( z \\\\) value at those coordinates be the same as calculating \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) directly on \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) fundamentally alters the coordinates, radically changing values due to the exponential increase, which leads to a different resultant \\\\( z \\\\) when computed at the new coordinates compared to the original ones.",
