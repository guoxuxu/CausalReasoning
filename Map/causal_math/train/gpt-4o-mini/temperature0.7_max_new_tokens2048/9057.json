  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = C \\\\int_0^t \\\\exp(A(s-t))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A, B, and C are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) where D is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) is applied to the equation without any changes to \\\\( u(t) \\\\), will \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be different from \\\\( Dz(T) = DC \\\\int_0^T \\\\exp(A(s-T))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) is equivalent to transforming the output by D, and since the operation on u(t) has not been altered, the resultant \\\\( w(T) \\\\) directly equals \\\\( Dz(T) \\\\), following the linearity of the integral and matrix multiplication.",
