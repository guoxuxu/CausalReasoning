  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), which is applied to an input function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) in a linear system defined by the integral transform \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h(t-u) x(u) du \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response. An additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is considered as an intervention.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or no intervention), solely from the knowledge of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcomes measured in \\\\( y(T) \\\\) can be achieved through various combinations of interventions and initial conditions because the convolution process can mask the effects of different transformations applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The potential overlap in results from different inputs and transformations adds ambiguity in pinpointing the exact interventions.",
