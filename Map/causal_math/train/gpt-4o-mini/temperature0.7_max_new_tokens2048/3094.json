  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the impact of the Laplace Transform and its inverse on this function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) uniquely corresponds to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\). Therefore, knowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) enables the precise recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) via the inverse Laplace Transform, assuming proper conditions are met.",
