  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + au_x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can the original transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) be determined uniquely without knowing the system's dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the constant \\\\(a\\\\) and how it influences the system's dynamics via the term \\\\(e^{-iakT}\\\\), it is not possible to uniquely back-calculate to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) just by knowing \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\). The solution's evolution critically depends on these dynamics.",
