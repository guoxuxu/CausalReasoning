  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) after observing the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the exact transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform can obscure some information about the phase of the original signal unless it's specifically tailored to preserve it. Without knowing how the transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was applied, \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced.",
