  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). The function examines evolution under a rotational transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modeled by another complex function \\\\( g(t) = e^{iBt}y \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new variable \\\\( B \\\\) and can modify the trajectory and final state of the system depending on how \\\\( B \\\\) relates to \\\\( A \\\\). Even if the effects are similar when both are proportional, in general scenarios they usually combine to influence the outcome in complex ways that depend on both matrices.",
