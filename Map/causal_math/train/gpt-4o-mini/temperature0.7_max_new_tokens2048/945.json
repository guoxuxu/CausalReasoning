  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over the complex domain and transformed through a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} z(x) \\\\, dx \\\\). We aim to analyze the relationship between the original function and its transform's behavior, specifically through operations such as scaling and modulation.\n\nIf \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is scaled by a constant factor \\\\( a \\\\) yielding a new function \\\\( z(ax) \\\\), will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z(ax)) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without modification?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the function \\\\( z(ax) \\\\) affects the Fourier transform. Specifically, scaling in the time domain corresponds to a reciprocal scaling in the frequency domain, along with additional scaling by \\\\( 1/|a| \\\\). Thus, \\\\( F(z(ax))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is not the same as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\); rather, it equals \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{|a|}F(z)(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{a}) \\\\).",
