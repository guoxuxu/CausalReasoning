  "Problem": "Consider a closed system involving a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a pole. The input signal is \\\\( x(t) = e^{st} \\\\). We study the system's behavior under Laplace transforms and analyze the effects of introducing an interrupting signal \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the step function.\n\nKnowing the output after intervention with \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\), is it possible to discern whether the initial signal was \\\\( e^{pt} \\\\) or another exponential of a different rate?",
  "Explanation": "Post-intervention knowledge of the output does not provide sufficient information to untangle the specific form of the original exponential input or its parameters from the effects imposed by the interrupted signal \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\). The superposition from multiple exponentials and overlap in transformative effects muddle the causal backtracking.",
