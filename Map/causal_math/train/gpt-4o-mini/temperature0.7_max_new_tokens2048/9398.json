  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nCan we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it is unclear whether the starting point was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{iBt}z_0 \\\\). As such, reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be uniquely achieved without additional information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or the value of B.",
