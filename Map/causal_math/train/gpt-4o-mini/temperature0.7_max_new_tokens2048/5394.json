  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) representing wave propagation, where c is the wave speed. We explore the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to convert the spatial variable into the frequency domain.\n\nAfter observing the wave at time T in the frequency domain, can we accurately determine the initial waveform \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing whether it was transformed into the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier Transform is a bijective operation, observing the wave in the frequency domain allows for an exact reverse transformation, yielding the initial waveform in the spatial domain regardless of whether the initial transformation was known.",
