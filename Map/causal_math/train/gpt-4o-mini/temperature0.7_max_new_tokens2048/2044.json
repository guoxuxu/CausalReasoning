  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, is used to transform the initial condition.\n\nSeeing the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), is it possible to determine accurately what transformations (either \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\), \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\), or both) were applied during its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) can result from various possible combinations and timings of applying \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\). The overlapping and non-commutative effects of exponential matrix transformations on the evolving function make it impossible to uniquely back-calculate all interventions based solely on the final observation.",
