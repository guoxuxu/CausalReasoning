  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) operating on the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. We explore how linear transformations given by matrices affect this function through Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\), characterized as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain, can we uniquely recover the time-based function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier Transform of \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) directly provides \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), due to the bijective nature of the Fourier Transform for functions satisfying certain conditions like being square integrable, which applies here.",
