  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z(t) \\), respectively. The Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} \\) is used to analyze the system behavior in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} \\), is it possible to uniquely reconstruct the original function \\( z(t) \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} \\) uniquely determines \\( z(t) \\), assuming that the function \\( z(t) \\) meets necessary conditions for the transform. These conditions ensure that the transform is one-to-one, allowing for the unique reconstruction of \\( z(t) \\) from its transform.",
