  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a linear operator. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where L is another linear operator and S is a transformation matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can you determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is insufficient to backtrack uniquely to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without records of whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied. The transformation could have altered the initial condition in a manner that is not recoverable only from the final state under M, especially if L introduces new dynamics not aligned with M.",
