  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) defined on a complex domain, and a transformation h(z) where \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\). We analyze the effect of applying this transformation to various complex numbers and observing the results over the domain.\n\nIf at a certain point, another transformation g(z) = e^z is applied as an intervention to the output of h(z), will the final output of f(z) for this transformed value depend solely on the initial function h(z)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with g(z) adds another layer of transformation which significantly affects the original mapping provided by h(z). The outcome of f(z) now depends on both the exponential transformation and the squaring, making the system's behavior more complex and not solely dependent on h(z).",
