  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is the temperature at a point \\\\((x, y)\\\\). We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions, defined by the function \\\\(g(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(x, y)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) describes initial temperature distribution along the boundary.\n\nIf a new boundary condition is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) using a different transform, \\\\(g'(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h'(x, y)\\\\}(s)\\\\), will the final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) only depend on the later transformation and not the original \\\\(g(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) will be affected by both the initial and subsequent boundary conditions because the Laplace system responses are cumulative. Changes introduced by \\\\(g'(s)\\\\) will superpose on the distribution already influenced by \\\\(g(s)\\\\), leading to a complex interplay.",
