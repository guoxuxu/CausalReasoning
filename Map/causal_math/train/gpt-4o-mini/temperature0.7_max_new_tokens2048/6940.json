  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nCan we precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both), by analyzing the system's state at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations solely from the state at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) is not possible due to the overlapping effects of different matrix exponentiations and their non-trivial impact on the system's trajectory in both time and frequency domains. Multiple combinations of transformations can lead to similar or indistinguishable outcomes at time \\\\( t \\\\).",
