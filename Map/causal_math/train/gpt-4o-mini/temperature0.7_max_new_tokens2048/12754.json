  "Problem": "Consider the evaluation of the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\\\cos(tx) \\\\, dx \\\\) changing the variable x through the transformation \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants and analyzing the impact on the function's behaviour.\n\nIf an intervention is made by changing the function to \\\\( f(u) = e^{-au^2+b} \\\\cos(tu) \\\\) halfway through computation, will the final result still only depend on the original variable adjustments made by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the functional form and, subsequently, the outcome of the integral. Although \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) still influence the result through the initial variable change, the new function adds another level of complexity that affects the final integral result, thus not solely depending on the original constants.",

The function f(u) is derived from u and depends on both a and b, which also impacts I.
