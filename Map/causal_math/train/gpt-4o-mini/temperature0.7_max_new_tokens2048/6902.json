  "Problem": "Let's consider a function \\( z = h(x, y) \\) given by \\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\) in a two-dimensional space. We examine the role of a Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), applied to \\( h(x, y) \\) defined by \\( H(u, v) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(u, v) \\) and analyze its effect in the frequency domain.\n\nBy observing the transformed function \\( H(u, v) \\) in the frequency domain, can we deduce the exact original function \\( h(x, y) \\) without knowing the specific transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise knowledge of the Fourier transform parameters and any additional operations applied in the frequency domain, it is impossible to accurately deduce \\( h(x, y) \\) from \\( H(u, v) \\). Information loss or modification through the transformation process can impede exact reconstruction of the original function.",
