  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to the variable z in the complex plane over time t, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the output from \\\\( f \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether none, \\\\( g \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), or both), just by observing the result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\) could alternatively reinforce or counteract each other's effects depending on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and timings, leading to potential ambiguity about the transformations applied unless further information about phase or magnitude changes is known.",
