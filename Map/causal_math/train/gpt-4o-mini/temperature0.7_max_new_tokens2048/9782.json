  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) defined by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion). We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(X) \\\\), we cannot know if the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) was involved, which could significantly alter the mean and variance paths of the stochastic process. This uncertainty prevents accurate back-calculation of \\\\( X_0 \\\\).",
