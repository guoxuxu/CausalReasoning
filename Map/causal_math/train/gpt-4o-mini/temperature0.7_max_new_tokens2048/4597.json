  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int \\\\frac{f(w)}{w - z} dw \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is an analytic function defined on a complex domain excluding the point z. The integral is calculated over a closed contour enclosing z. We want to infer changes and effects of applying transformations based on the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(w) \\\\) is applied to a contour at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is calculated without further manipulations, will this result in the same value for \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as if the contour had not been transformed by \\\\( h(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(w) \\\\), which is essentially a rotation by the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) in the complex plane, leaves the value of the integral invariant due to the properties of complex line integrals and the nature of analytic functions. Thus, the calculated value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) remains unchanged.",
