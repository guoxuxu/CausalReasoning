  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) governed by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + e^{iBt} \\\\), where B is another real number, applied at time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z - e^{iCt} \\\\) (where C is a real number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) further modifies the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on A, B, and C. The transformations involving B and C influence the trajectory differently, affecting the output at time T in combination with the underlying evolution due to A.",
