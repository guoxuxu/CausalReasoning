  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving in time according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. The system's evolution is further examined under an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Ps} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved simply under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system by integrating the effects of the exponential decaying factor and the initial state over time, leading to a transformation of the path that cannot be achieved by merely solving the differential equation.",
