  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a Hermitian matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is a fixed complex vector. The transformation evolves a quantum state in time t in a closed system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a perturbative Hamiltonian \\\\( H' \\\\) described by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{iH't} \\\\) acts on the system, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be unaffected by \\\\( H' \\\\) at time T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by a perturbative Hamiltonian \\\\( H' \\\\) introduces a new transformation factor, modifying the system's trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. This changes the resultant state due to the new exponential operator acting on the state, manifesting in a changed evolution that differs from the original unperturbed path.",
