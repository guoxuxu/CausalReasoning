  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation on the state vector described by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nHaving observed \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can the initial computation of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) be determined without any additional information about intermediate states?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) involves integrating the state over a time interval, which depends on the entire trajectory from time 0 to T. Without detailed information about the state at all intermediate times, one cannot retroactively compute \\\\( h(x) \\\\) solely from \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
