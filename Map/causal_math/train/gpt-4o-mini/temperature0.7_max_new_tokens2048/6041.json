  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented in matrix form \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. The system is transformed by performing a Laplace transform which alters the system to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) denotes the Laplace transform, and s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf the original system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) is used to compute a solution x, and subsequently, the Laplace transform is applied to this solution, does the resulting transformed solution \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(x)(s)\\\\) satisfy the transformed equation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming there are no singularities affecting the convergence, and if the Laplace transforms \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(x)\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(b)\\\\) are all well-defined, the transformed system should still hold as the operation of the Laplace transform is linear and obeys the superposition and homogeneity principles applicable to linear systems.",
