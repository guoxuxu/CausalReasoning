  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to this function and then subsequently its inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and then the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) is directly applied without further manipulation, will the resulting function be identical to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform and then the inverse Laplace transform to a function without modifications results in the original function, assuming appropriate conditions on the function and convergence properties. For \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), these transforms act as mathematical inverses without altering the function.",
