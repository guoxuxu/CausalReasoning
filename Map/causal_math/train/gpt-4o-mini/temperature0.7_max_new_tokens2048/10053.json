  "Problem": "Examine a system where electric potential V is described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) within a region and manipulate the boundary conditions to observe causal effects. We're especially interested in how transformations such as conformal mappings can infer changes in electric field distributions.\n\nIf a conformal mapping \\\\(f(z) = z^2\\\\) is applied to transform the spatial domain, does this change the solution \\\\(V\\\\) within the new domain although starting with the same boundary conditions in the original domain?",
  "Explanation": "Conformal mappings preserve the angle but not the length, distorting distances and therefore affecting the gradient of potential, \\\\(\\\\nabla V\\\\). Since boundary conditions are the same but the domain shape changes, the solution inside the domain, i.e., the distribution of electric potential, will differ.",
