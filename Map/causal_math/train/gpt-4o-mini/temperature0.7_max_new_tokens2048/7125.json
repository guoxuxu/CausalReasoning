  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0 \\), commonly known as the wave equation, where \\( c \\) is the wave speed. The study focuses on the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-s^2x^2} u(x,t) \\, dx \\), where \\( s \\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\( T(u) \\) is applied at \\( t = 0 \\) to a function \\( u(x,0) \\), and then the wave equation is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\( T(u(x,T)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\( u(x, T) \\) and then applying \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The wave equation governs the evolution of \\( u(x,t) \\) through time and space dependencies. The application of \\( T \\) initially alters the spatial structure by integrating over \\( x \\) with a Gaussian kernel, which impacts how \\( u(x,t) \\) evolves over time. The evolution of \\( u(x, t) \\) and \\( T(u(x,t)) \\) are, therefore, dependent on the transformed initial conditions and hence will not be the same.",
