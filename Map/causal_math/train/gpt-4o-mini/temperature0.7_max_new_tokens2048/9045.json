  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\\\) where C is a contour in the complex plane and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function. Analyze the impact of changing the contour C to another contour C' in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed along contour C at time t = 0, and then contour is changed to C' at a later time without further intervention, will \\\\( F(z) \\\\) computed at t = T along C' be the same as if calculated along C?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the complex integral transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is generally dependent on the choice of the contour due to the residue theorem and potential singularities enclosed by the contour. Changing the contour can potentially change the contributions from these singularities, thus altering the outcome.",
