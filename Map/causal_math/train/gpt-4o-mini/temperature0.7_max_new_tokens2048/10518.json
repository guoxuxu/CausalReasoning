  "Problem": "Consider the system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\Delta u\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diffusion constant and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. This equation is initially transformed by \\\\( v(x, t_0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x, t_0) e^{ikx} dx \\\\), which represents the Fourier transform at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nGiven the observed Fourier transform \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t \\\\), can one precisely deduce the initial Fourier transform \\\\( v(x, t_0) \\\\) without knowing the specifics of how it evolved?",
  "Explanation": "Since the evolution in Fourier space due to the diffusion equation is well understood and reversible up to the exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-Dk^2t} \\\\), one can recover \\\\( v(x, t_0) \\\\) by applying the inverse operation, \\\\( v(x, t_0) = e^{Dk^2t}v(x, t) \\\\).",
