  "Problem": "We consider a linear system transformed by applying a Fourier Transform to its input signal \\(x(t)\\), resulting in \\(X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\\). Let the system be characterized by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix, and the output given by \\(y(t)\\) is also transformed, \\(Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\\).\n\nIf \\(X(ω)\\) is initially computed and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\) without any further intervention, will \\(Y(ω)\\) at some frequency \\(\\omega\\) be the differential transformation of \\(X(ω)\\) under the influence of \\(K\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier Transform is a linear operator and the system is governed by a linear differential equation, the output \\(Y(ω)\\) will be the original input \\(X(ω)\\) modified according to the system's characteristics encapsulated in matrix \\(K\\). The transformation of input leads directly to the prescribed modification in the output in the frequency domain.",
