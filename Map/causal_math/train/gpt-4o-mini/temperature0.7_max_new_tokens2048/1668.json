  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We analyze the impact of integral transformations using convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\) over the real number line.\n\nKnowing the final result after sequential convolutions with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we correctly infer whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied before or after \\\\( g(t) \\\\) based only on the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the commutative property of convolution, the order of applying \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) cannot be distinctly determined from the final convolution outcome alone. The results of convolving with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) then \\\\( h(t) \\\\) are indistinguishable from convolving with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) then \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
