  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\(\\\\Delta T(t)\\\\) in a material is governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T\\\\), where \\\\(k > 0\\\\) is a constant related to the thermal conductivity of the material. We examine the effect of an external heating function \\\\( h(t) = H e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant heat input.\n\nIf the external heating function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied from t = 0 and the system evolves according to the given differential equation, will the temperature at time T be the same as if no heating function was applied and only the natural cooling process took place?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the heating function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) significantly alters the system's temperature trajectory. The external heat input modifies the initial rate of temperature change, leading to a higher temperature at any time T compared to the scenario with just natural cooling.",
