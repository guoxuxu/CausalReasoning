  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) on a vector \\\\( v \\\\) in a vector space, where A is a constant matrix. Assessing the role of an additive perturbation \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) applied to this transformation, where \\\\( w \\\\) is another constant vector.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(v) \\\\), it is unclear whether the initial condition was \\\\( v_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Av_0 \\\\. The lack of information about the initial application of A makes it impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( v_0 \\\\).",
