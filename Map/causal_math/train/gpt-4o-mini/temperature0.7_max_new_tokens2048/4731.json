  "Problem": "Consider a function on a complex plane governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^{2} \\\\) affects the output when applied at different instances.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final result \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect a simple composition of the effects of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory by shifting every subsequent value of \\\\( z \\\\) before further transformations. Since the exponential function is sensitive to addition (shifting the exponential growth rate), the final value will depend intricately on the interaction between these transformations, and not just their mere composition.",
