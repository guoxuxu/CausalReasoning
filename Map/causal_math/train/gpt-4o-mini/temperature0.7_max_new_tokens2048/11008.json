  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes analysis under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we precisely identify the transformations applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), merely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformations used is infeasible from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone due to the same complex exponential scaling result attainable through numerous combinations of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\). The presence of multiple possible pre-intervention and intervention scenarios that yield the same final state precludes unique determination.",
