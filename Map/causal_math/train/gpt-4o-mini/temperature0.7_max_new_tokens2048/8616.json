  "Problem": "Assume we are dealing with a circuit system characterized by a linear transformation given by a matrix product \\\\( R = MC \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix representing the Maxwell's equations and \\\\( C \\\\) represents electrical properties of materials like capacitance and resistance.\n\nGiven the response matrix \\\\( R \\\\) at a later time, can we exactly determine which elements of matrix \\\\( C \\\\) were altered during the intervention, solely based on the information in \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of how the intervention altered \\\\( C \\\\), multiple configurations of changes in \\\\( C \\\\) combined with the propagation governed by \\\\( M \\\\) could result in the same final matrix \\\\( R \\\\). Hence, we cannot uniquely pinpoint the changes in \\\\( C \\\\) solely based on \\\\( R \\\\).",
