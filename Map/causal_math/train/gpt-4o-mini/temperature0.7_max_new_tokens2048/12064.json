  "Problem": "Examine a complex function system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. The system's dynamics are altered by applying transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz^n \\\\) where C is a complex constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then permitted to progress under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\) without additional modifications, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was purely subjected to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\) up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz^n \\\\) changes the initial condition by scaling and potentially rotating and/or applying non-linear transformations (in case of n>1) to the initial vector. This modification establishes a new trajectory, influenced by the powers of the initial state, making the resultant state at time T distinct.",
