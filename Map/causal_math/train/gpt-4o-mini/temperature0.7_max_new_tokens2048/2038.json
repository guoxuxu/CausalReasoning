  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) represents the Laplacian operator. We are interested in the effect of applyingt the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\), which transforms the function into the Fourier space, on the causal inference in the system.\n\nCan we accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) from the observed \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\), without knowing if a Fourier transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform and its inverse are lossless and considering that the PDE uniquely determines the future state, \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), we can uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) irrespective of the knowledge about the transformation.",
