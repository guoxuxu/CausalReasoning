  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the function under the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nWith an additional intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (R being another constant matrix) is applied, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on P, or also on Q and R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics to the system, with transformation \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\). The final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus depends not only on P but also on how both Q and R have influenced the trajectory throughout T, altering both growth and direction.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time t is influenced by the matrix P, resulting in the transformation of z(t) under the equation z(t) = Pz. The transformation g(z), which is affected by the matrix Q, also modifies z(t). Additionally, at time t_1, the application of h(z) is influenced by the matrix R, which affects the behavior of z(t) after t_1. Therefore, the endpoint z(T) depends on the matrices P, Q, and R.",
