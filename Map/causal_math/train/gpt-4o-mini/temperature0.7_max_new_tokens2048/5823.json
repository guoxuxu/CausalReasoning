  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{tA}x\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix with complex eigenvalues and \\\\(x\\\\) is an initial complex vector. We investigate the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\(S(z) = Vz\\\\) (where \\\\(V\\\\) is also a unitary matrix) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), be independent of the initial transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though both transformations are unitary and therefore preserve the norm and the orthogonality, the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will depend on both \\\\(U\\\\) and \\\\(V\\\\) because these transformations can change the basis of the eigenvectors involved. This affects how the state evolves through the dynamics governed by \\\\(A\\\\).",
