  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the impact of the Fourier Transform and its inverse defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( F^{-1}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention which is represented by another transform, say \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-3\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\), is applied, will the final state at t = T only depend on the dynamics represented by \\\\( A \\\\), and not on the initial Fourier Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) adds a new dimension to the transformation, mixing frequency components in another manner. The final state at t = T will therefore depend not just on \\\\( A \\\\) but also on how \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(z) \\\\) interact and alter the trajectory in the complex-frequency domain.",
