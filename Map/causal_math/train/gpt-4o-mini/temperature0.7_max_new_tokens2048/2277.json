  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the integral transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( e^{-2t} \\\\) and influences the system through the convolution \\\\( y(t) = (f * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is set as \\\\( e^{3t} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve through the convolution without further intervention, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be determined solely by the Laplace transforms of \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a direct result of the convolution of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and by properties of the Laplace transform, \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) can be expressed as the product of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\). Therefore, assuming no change in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after t = 0, the output is determined solely by these transforms.",
