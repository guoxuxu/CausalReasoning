  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is produced by applying a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The output is then transformed by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze how these transformations affect the relationship between input and output over time t.\n\nWithout knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, can we reverse engineer the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solely by observing the output at time \\\\( t \\\\), \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If it is not known whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the alterations introduced by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) could significantly modify the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\), rendering it infeasible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without additional information.",
