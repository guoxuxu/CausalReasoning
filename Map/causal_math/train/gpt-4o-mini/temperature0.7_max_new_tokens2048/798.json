  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{s^2} ds \\\\) over the complex plane. We examine the implications of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where a and b are complex constants, on points in the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after computing \\\\( g(T(z_0)) \\\\) without knowing the parameters of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the input point, and without knowing \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it is mathematically infeasible to uniquely reverse the effect of \\\\( T \\\\) and determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( g(T(z_0)) \\\\).",
