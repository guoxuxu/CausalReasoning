  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a functional relationship between input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The equation governing the system is \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nGiven an observed output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at s = S, can we deduce the exact scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) applied to an unknown initial voltage \\\\( V_0(s) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial state \\\\( V_0(s) \\\\) or its characteristics, one cannot uniquely determine the scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) applied. Multiple combinations of \\\\( V_0(s) \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) could result in the same observed \\\\( I(s) \\\\).",
