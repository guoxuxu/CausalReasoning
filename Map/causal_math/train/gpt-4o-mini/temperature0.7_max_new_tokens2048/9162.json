  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\), affects the function and the implications of different transformations.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\), can we uniquely determine the parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) of the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)}\\\\) directly reveals the complex numbers \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\). The real part of the pole gives \\\\(a\\\\), and the imaginary part provides \\\\(b\\\\), allowing the unique identification of both parameters from the transformed function.",
