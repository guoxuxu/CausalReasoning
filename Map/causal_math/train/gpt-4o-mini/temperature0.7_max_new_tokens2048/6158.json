  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We analyze the system’s behavior when exposed to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = De^{Nt}z \\\\), where D and N are constant matrices and D is diagonalizable.\n\nHaving observed the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after evolving according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), is it possible to infer uniquely whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = De^{Nt}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions uniquely depending on D and N, which might not uniquely determine the starting state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just based on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially without exact knowledge of the transformation parameters.",
