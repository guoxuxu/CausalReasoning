  "Problem": "Consider a partially observable system where the state at time t, denoted by \\\\( x(t) \\\\), evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx(t) = Cx(t) dt + dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the noise in the system. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is observed over time until t = T without any interventions, will the observable state at any intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), \\\\( 0 < t_1 < T \\\\), be independent of the transformation \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\) alters the initial observable state, changing not only the initial condition but potentially also how subsequent observations are affected by the system dynamics and noise. Since \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) might not commute, the interaction between the system dynamics and the transformation can modify the observed trajectory throughout the interval from 0 to T.",
