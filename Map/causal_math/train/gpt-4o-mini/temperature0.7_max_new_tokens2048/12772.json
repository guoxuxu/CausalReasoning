  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax + B} \\\\) with matrices A and B. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) to analyze its properties in the frequency domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is Fourier transformed without any modifications, will the resulting function \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) reflect solely the characteristics of the matrix A in the exponential term?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) will incorporate transformations influenced by both A and B, not just A. The term \\\\( B \\\\) will shift the phase and magnitude in the frequency domain, hence affecting the spectral characteristics of the transformed function.",
