  "Problem": "Assume that we have a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z(t + 1) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a linear operator represented by a matrix. We consider the modification caused by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = N^t z \\\\), where N is also a matrix representation of a linear operator.\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the system's state at time t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), because the transformation \\\\( N^t \\\\) might have altered it in an irrecoverable way, especially if N does not uniquely determine its previous states.",
