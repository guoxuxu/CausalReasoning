  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its related complex function transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). We examine the impact of these transformations on the integration path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the integral result of \\\\( \\\\int_C g(f(z)) dz \\\\) for some contour C, can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or the original path without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's not possible to accurately trace back to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or the original integration path, as \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could dramatically alter the characteristics and path of the integral.",
