  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of the operator \\\\( F(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where K is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the transformation matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention \\\\( G(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is applied, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(x) \\\\) introduces an additional transformation governed by M, and since S, K, and M are involved, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at any time post-intervention is affected by these matrices as well as D. The state's evolution is influenced significantly by the interactions of these transformations.",
