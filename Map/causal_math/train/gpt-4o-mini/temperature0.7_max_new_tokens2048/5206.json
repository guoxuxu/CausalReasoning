  "Problem": "Imagine a system involving heat transfer on a rod modelled by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\), where \\( u \\) represents the temperature, \\( t \\) is the time, and \\( x \\) the position along the rod. The transformation \\( v(x, t) = u(x, t) + h(t)e^{ax} \\) is considered, where \\( h(t) \\) is a specific heat source function and \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the initial profile \\( u_0 \\) accurately after observing \\( v(x, t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\( v(x, t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\( v(x, t) \\) involving \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original profile \\( u_0 \\) as \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) may have significantly altered the state's evolution.",
