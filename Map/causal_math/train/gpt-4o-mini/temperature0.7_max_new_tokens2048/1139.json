  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nIf an additional transformation, say multiplication by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\\\), is applied before taking the Fourier transform, will the transform still show a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\) before the Fourier transform effectively neutralizes the exponential term, resulting in the integrand becoming unity across all x. The Fourier transform of a constant function (like 1) distributes across all frequencies, thus not producing a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\).",
