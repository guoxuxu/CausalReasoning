  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + At + B \\\\), where A and B are constants. Analysis is done on the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Uz \\\\), where U is a constant matrix, that modifies the trajectory of z.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = Vz \\\\), where V is a different constant matrix, is applied at some t=T_1<T, will the function form at T still be unaffected by the transformations U and V?",
  "Explanation": "The application of both \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( V \\\\) as transformations at different times introduces new dynamics into the system. The overall trajectory and final form at time T are affected by both transformations, altering the standard quadratic nature of the original function.",
