  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the variable s.\n\nIf an operation alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such that \\\\( z(t) = a \\cdot e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) with a constant scalar a before applying the Fourier transform, will the position of the peak in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) change?",
  "Explanation": "The operation of scaling \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a constant scalar \\\\( a \\\\) affects the amplitude but not the frequency of the function. Thus, the Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will still peak at \\\\( s = \\omega / (2\\pi) \\\\). This demonstrates that scaling the input merely affects amplitude and does not displace the frequency components in the Fourier transform domain.",
