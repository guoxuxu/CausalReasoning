  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + u_{xx} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) are the time and second space derivatives of \\\\(u\\\\), respectively. To study the problem, we use the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x,t)dx\\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention applies an inverse Fourier transform followed by a function modification \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(x, t_1) = u(x, t_1) + c\\\\) (where c is a constant) and then is transformed again, will the end value of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the initial conditions at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the state of the system at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) by modifying the spatial function \\\\(u(x, t_1)\\\\). This change directly affects the subsequent evolution of the system and the Fourier transform at any time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\). Consequently, \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) depends on both the initial conditions and the changes made during the intervention.",

The function u is transformed into its Fourier representation, hat(u), which is modified at time t1 into tilde(u) by adding a constant c. This modified function tilde(u) is then transformed back into Fourier space, influencing the value of hat(u) at time t1. Finally, hat(u) at time t1 affects hat(u) at a later time T.
