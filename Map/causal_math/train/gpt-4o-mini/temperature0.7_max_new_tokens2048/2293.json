  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. This scenario explores how the Laplace transform impacts the behavior of the function over time.\n\nIf a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and this transformed function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is then used without any further transformation, will the influence of the variable \\\\( a \\\\) still be detectable in \\\\( z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) leads to \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), where the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) distinctly defines the form of \\\\( z(s) \\\\). Thus, the influence of \\\\( a \\\\) is directly observable in the transformed function without any additional intervention.",
