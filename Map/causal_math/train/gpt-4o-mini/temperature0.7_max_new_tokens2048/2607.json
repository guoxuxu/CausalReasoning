  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) for a matrix M.\n\nIf a further altering transformation \\\\( h(x) = Nx \\\\) (where N is another matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\), does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) purely depend on D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) = Nx \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the system. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will also depend on how N interacts with D, in addition to any earlier effects from M. Therefore, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will not depend solely on D.",
