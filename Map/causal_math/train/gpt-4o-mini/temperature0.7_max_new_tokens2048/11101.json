  "Problem": "Investigate a system characterized by the continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) of a signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), denoted as \\\\(X(f)\\\\). Explore how the multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) in the time domain, where \\\\(f_0\\\\) is a frequency offset, affects the transform.\n\nBy modifying the signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) to \\\\(x(t)e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) at t = 0 and then calculating the CTFT, will the spectrum \\\\(X(f)\\\\) simply shift by \\\\(f_0\\\\) in frequency without any additional changes?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) in time domain corresponds to a frequency shift in the Fourier domain. This is a direct application of the modulation property of the Fourier transform, which states that multiplying a time-domain signal by a complex exponential results in a frequency shift of its spectrum by \\\\(f_0\\\\) without altering the shape or amplitude distribution of the spectrum.",
