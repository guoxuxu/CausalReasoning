  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) which is a mapping from the complex plane to itself, given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The time evolution of a system is initially influenced by the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\), then governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\), where c is a complex constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), and seeing only the outcome at time T, it's impossible to determine if the initial state was modified by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega z_0} \\\\). The transformation could drastically alter the phase and hence the entire trajectory, making retrodiction to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) ambiguous.",
