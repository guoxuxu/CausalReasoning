  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. Explore the effects of applying a transformation matrix \\\\(T\\\\) to both sides of the equation, resulting in \\\\(T(Ax) = Tb\\\\).\n\nGiven the solution vector \\\\(x\\\\) at some time \\\\(t\\\\) from the transformed system \\\\(TAx = Tb\\\\), can we infer the original system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the explicit knowledge of \\\\(T\\\\) and whether it was used, it is unfeasible to uniquely trace back to the original system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\). The transformation could have changed solvability conditions and other critical aspects of the matrix equation.",
