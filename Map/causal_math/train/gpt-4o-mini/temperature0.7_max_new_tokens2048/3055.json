  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time Markov chain with state space \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\) governed by the transition rate matrix \\\\(Q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -\\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\). We are investigating the effect of modifying transition rates with a scalar function \\\\(f(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf a second scaling function \\\\(g(t) = e^{\\\\beta t}\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the transition rates further, will the state probabilities at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), be determined entirely by the original matrix \\\\(Q\\\\) regardless of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention by \\\\(g(t)\\\\) complicates the dynamic by further adjusting the transition rates, making the final probabilities at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) dependent not only on \\\\(Q\\\\) but also on the values of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\). These factors influence the rate at which transitions occur, thus affecting the entire evolution of the state probabilities.",
