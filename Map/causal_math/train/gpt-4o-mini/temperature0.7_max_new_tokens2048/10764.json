  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We examine the influence of an external heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) modeled by the transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + q(x,t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether the heat source \\\\( f(u) \\\\), the cooling function \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end temperature \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) could potentially be the result of various combinations and intensities of heating and cooling interventions. The overlap of possible temperature distributions arising from different amounts and distributions of \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x,t) \\\\) makes it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions from the endpoint alone.",
