  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables. We study the function transformation by the integral kernel \\\\( K(s, t) = e^{-st} \\\\) under operation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(s,t) f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf another function \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and subsequent calculations are performed using the integral kernel, will the result at T depend only on the initial transformation and not on the intervention function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new function which, when transformed, affects the end results due to the nature of integration mixing the exponential terms from both original and intervention functions, therefore making the computation influenced by both.",
