  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis problem where the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is transformed using an integral along a contour \\\\( C \\\\). The contour \\\\( C \\\\) is specified to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Assume that the variable transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to modify the path of integration.\n\nIf a further transformation, \\\\( i(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), is applied as an intervention during the integration process, will the resulting value of the integral over \\\\( h(z)(C) \\\\) depend solely on the properties of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added transformation \\\\( i(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) during the integration introduces another layer of modification to the integration path and potentially the function's values at different points in the contour. This makes the final integral value dependent on \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( i(z) \\\\), and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), not just \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The effects of these transformations on the path and function values are non-trivial and dependent on their specific mathematical properties.",
