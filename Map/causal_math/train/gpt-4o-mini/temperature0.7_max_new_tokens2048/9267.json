  "Problem": "Consider the balance of a linear mechanical system with mass, spring, and damper. The governing differential equation is \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} + c\\\\dot{x} + kx = 0 \\\\), where m is mass, c is damping coefficient, k is spring constant, and x is displacement.\n\nIf an external force \\\\( F(t) = F_0 e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), would this intervention solely determine the displacement response of the system for any future time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), irrespective of the previous damping coefficient \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces an additional force, affecting the system's response. However, the overall displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will still depend on the mass, spring constant, previous damping coefficient, and earlier state of the system, not just on the intervention.",
