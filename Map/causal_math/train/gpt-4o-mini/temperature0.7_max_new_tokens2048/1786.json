  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in the domain describing a physical system. The transformation is defined by an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( v(x) = (T u)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} U(x, y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nCan we uniquely determine \\\\( u(x) \\\\) from the observed \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( u(x) \\\\) from \\\\( v(t) \\\\) requires the inverse operation of both \\\\( T \\\\) and the evolution under \\\\( A \\\\). Without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, multiple potential initial functions \\\\( u(x) \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( v(t) \\\\), especially when considering the variability introduced by the kernel \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\).",
