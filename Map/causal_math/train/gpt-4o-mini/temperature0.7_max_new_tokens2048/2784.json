  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and i is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nCan we determine exactly what scalar function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) was used in the transformation \\\\( g(s)T[z](s) \\\\) from having access to the transformed output only?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the transformed output \\\\( g(s)T[z](s) \\\\) without additional information about either \\\\( g(s) \\\\) or \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) does not provide enough information to unambiguously identify \\\\( g(s) \\\\). There could be multiple scalar functions that when convolved with different inputs could yield the same transformed output, leading to non-unique solutions.",
