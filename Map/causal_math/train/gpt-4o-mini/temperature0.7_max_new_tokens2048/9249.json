  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant real number, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) the initial complex value. We are interested in studying the effect of applying the linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant real number.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves according to \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) without any further action, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(T\\\\) be equivalent to \\\\(z(T)\\\\) if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was simply allowed to evolve to \\\\(T\\\\) under \\\\(e^{iAt}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) modifies the initial condition by the factor \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), changing the trajectory to \\\\(z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t}z_0\\\\). Thus, the resulting state at \\\\(t = T\\\\) will be different due to the composite effect of \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(A\\\\).",
