  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function describes an oscillatory system in the complex plane. We examine the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system and its implications on the causal inference.\n\nIf the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is known at time T, is it possible to determine the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without knowing whether the function form was altered?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Laplace transform of the system \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} (s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), one can solve for \\\\( \\omega \\\\) as it directly appears in the expression. The structure of the transform allows for the determination of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) irrespective of alterations to the amplitude or other factors, as long as the exponential form with \\\\( i\\omega \\\\) remains constant.",
