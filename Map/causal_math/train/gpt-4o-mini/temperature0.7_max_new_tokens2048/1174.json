  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nCan the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the function after time t if only \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) is known but not whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) obscures the back calculation to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the integrated form involving B may have critically altered the time evolution, not derivable purely from observing the final state under \\\\( iAz \\\\).",
