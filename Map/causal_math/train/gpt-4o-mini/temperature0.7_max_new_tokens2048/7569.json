  "Problem": "Consider a set of functions defined by complex mappings \\\\( z = f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) where w is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit. The system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(w(t)) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) = g + ht \\\\) where g and h are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is applied to a constant complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( w(t) = w_0 + ht \\\\) without further changes, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from simply evolving \\\\( w_0 \\\\) under \\\\( w(t) = w_0 + ht \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(w) \\\\) transforms the initial value from the linear real domain into the complex exponential, introducing periodic and oscillatory properties. As such, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) reflects both these properties and the linear real progression, making it different from merely a linear projection from the initial point.",
