  "Problem": "Consider the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in a flat, thin rod over time \\\\(t\\\\), governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the rod material. We investigate the impact of a change in boundary conditions defined by the step-function \\\\(\\\\phi(x) = T \\\\) (constant temperature) applied at one end of the rod.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new boundary condition \\\\(\\\\psi(x) = S\\\\) (another constant temperature) is applied at both ends of the rod, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the initial boundary condition \\\\(\\\\phi(x)\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\psi(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new boundary condition \\\\(\\\\psi(x)\\\\) will have a significant effect on the evolution of the temperature distribution after \\\\(t_1\\\\). The state of the system at \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) will depend heavily on both boundary conditions due to the compound effect and alteration of thermal gradients by \\\\(\\\\psi(x)\\\\).",
