  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Fourier transform on a time series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and consider an operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to it. We consider the variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the frequency domain with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied to the time series after it has been Fourier transformed and before applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the result \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and not on the nonlinear operation?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) introduces a nonlinearity that affects the spectrum of the signal, distorting \\\\( X(s) \\\\) before it is filtered by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). This results in a \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) that depends significantly on the nonlinear operation as well as the original signal and its filtering, modifying the final spectral components.",
