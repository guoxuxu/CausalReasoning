  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the system's transfer function in the Laplace domain. Suppose there's a sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\), and we are investigating the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) after processing through the system.\n\nIf an intervention changes the system's transfer function to \\\\(G(s)\\\\) halfway through the response time, will the steady-state output frequency content still only reflect the input frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transfer function \\\\(G(s)\\\\) midway still preserves the overall linearity and time-invariance on a larger scale. Thus, despite the change in system characteristics (like amplitude scaling and phase shift), the frequency of the output remains unaltered and continues to be \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
