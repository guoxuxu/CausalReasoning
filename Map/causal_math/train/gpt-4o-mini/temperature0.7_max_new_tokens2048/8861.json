  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T correspond to the direct computation of the integral from 0 to T of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct computation of \\\\( T(z)(T) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\omega t} dt \\\\) is the definition of applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). There are no alterations or additional interventions made to modify the trajectory or the calculation method.",
