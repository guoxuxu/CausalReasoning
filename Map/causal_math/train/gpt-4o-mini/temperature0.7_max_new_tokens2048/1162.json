  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega \\\\tau} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real-valued continuous function of time, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We seek to determine the implications of introducing a perturbation by the function \\\\( f(x) = x + c\\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the transformed integral at time T, can we determine the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the perturbation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the perturbation of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), it is impossible to determine if the constant \\\\( c \\\\) was added. This ambiguity affects the inverse transform process, making it unclear whether adjustments need to be made for the constant term.",
