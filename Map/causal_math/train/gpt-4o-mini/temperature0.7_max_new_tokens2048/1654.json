  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Nt} z \\\\, dt \\\\), with N also being a constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time T.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was processed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and subsequently evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and not the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) before evolution under \\\\( M \\\\), leaves ambiguity in backward tracing to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The integral transformation could have modified the trajectory in ways that are non-reversible solely with the knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
