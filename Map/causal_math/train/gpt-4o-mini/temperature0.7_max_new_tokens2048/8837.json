  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on the solution.\n\nIf \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is applied to the solution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and evolved to t = T under the rule \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without additional intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) deviate from the trajectory of a solution directly evolved from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T[z] \\\\) alters the initial trajectory of the function, as the integral transformation heavily depends on the past states and modifies the present state differently from simple evolution under the differential equation. Therefore, the trajectory of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not be the same as merely evolving \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
