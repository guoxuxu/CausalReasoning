  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the vector field is governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L \\{ v(t) \\} = sV(s) - v(0) \\), with \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\) where A is a constant matrix. We'll examine the effects of perturbing this system with another transform \\( f(v) = e^{Bt}v \\) where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( f(v) \\) is applied to a vector \\( v_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( v(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( v_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(v) \\) modifies the initial conditions of the trajectory, and since \\( e^{Bt} \\) can change the dynamics based on B's characteristics relative to A, the state at time T under the influence of \\( f \\) is different from that of the unperturbed system.",
