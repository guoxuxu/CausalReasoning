  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by a partial differential equation represented as \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of both time and space variables, and \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Consider the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) on the system for initial conditions.\n\nIf the initial conditions of the system are transformed by \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and then the system is evolved according to \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) without further transformation, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) be the formal inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and evolving according to \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) affects the system in the frequency domain. The evolution according to \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) in the Fourier space and subsequently applying the inverse Fourier transform would correctly retrieve the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) in the spatial domain, assuming no other alterations or nonlinear effects intervene.",
