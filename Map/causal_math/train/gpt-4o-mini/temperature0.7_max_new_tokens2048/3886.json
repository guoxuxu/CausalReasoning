  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) and let \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform over the spatial variables, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t) \\), on the solution's behavior.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at a later time T without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the inverse Fourier transform to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), the original state of the system \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) can be retrieved, which exactly reflects the propagated state from \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) under the governing heat equation, assuming no external perturbations.",
