  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t)) \\\\) applied to the spatial component of \\\\( u \\\\) and how it translates through time.\n\nKnowing only the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T)) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately recover the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowledge of intermediate transforms?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity and invertibility of the Fourier transform along with a correctly identified transformed operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(L) \\\\), it's possible to invert the process to uniquely determine \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T)) \\\\). This recovery relies on the preservation of information through the transform and the characteristics of L.",
