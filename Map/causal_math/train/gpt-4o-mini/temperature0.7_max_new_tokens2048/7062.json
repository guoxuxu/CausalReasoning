  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the continuous Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-domain signal. We analyze the impact of a modulation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the frequency spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{f}'(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we deduce the original signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing whether modulation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether and what type of modulation was applied, it's not possible to correctly deduce \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{f}'(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone, as the shift in frequency could misrepresent the original frequency components of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
