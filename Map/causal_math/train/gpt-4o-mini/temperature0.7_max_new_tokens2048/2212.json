  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nGiven the final complex number after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can one determine if the interventions were applied in the sequence \\\\( f \\\\) then \\\\( g \\\\), or if they were used in reverse or not used in conjunction?",
  "Explanation": "The non-trivial interplay between adding a constant in the exponential function's phase (via \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) and the sequence of applications (whether \\\\( f \\\\) then \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\) then \\\\( f \\\\) or both at once) results in different paths that could lead to the same outcome. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively ascertain the sequence of interventions solely by the final state.",
