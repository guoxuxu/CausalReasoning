  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant frequency parameter. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed using Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any later time t = T still be represented accurately by \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) merely results in a phase shift of the function, which does not alter the frequency content. Therefore, the initial Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = 0 continues to accurately represent the frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any other time T.",
