  "Problem": "In a physics experiment, a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) is modeled using the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a Hamiltonian operator. We run simulations using an initial condition \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) modified by a function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) representing a constant wave number.\n\nCan we determine the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine if the observed \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) resulted from an evolved \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) or from an evolved \\\\( f(\\\\psi_0(x)) \\\\) due to the phase shift introduced by \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\).",
