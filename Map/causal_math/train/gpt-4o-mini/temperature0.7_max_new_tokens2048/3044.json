  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nGiven information about \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain which transformations were applied (either \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) by analyzing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from numerous combinations of transformations due to the different phase shifts they introduce. Since these phase shifts can overlap and create the same final appearance in the complex plane, identifying the specific sequence or types of interventions solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible.",
