  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a vector space using a matrix M and its exponential \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) which acts on vectors in the space. We investigate the effects of initial transformations \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\), where N is another matrix, on the temporal evolution of vectors.\n\nIf you know the state of a particle at time T, \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can you determine unambiguously the initial conditions at t = 0 (i.e., whether \\\\(e^{Nt}x_0\\\\) or just \\\\(x_0\\\\) was used), knowing only that the evolution is governed by M?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether the initial transformation \\\\(e^{Nt}\\\\) was applied, the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) doesn't provide enough information to deduce the exact initial state (whether it was \\\\(e^{Nt}x_0\\\\) or \\\\(x_0\\\\)), especially since both transformations alter the trajectory potentially in a non-recoverable way.",
