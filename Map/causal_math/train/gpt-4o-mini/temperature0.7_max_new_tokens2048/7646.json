  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\( A \\) is a linear operator and \\( b \\) is a vector. We examine how the transformation and its inversion, where applicable, affect behavior over the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{cz} \\\\), with \\( c \\) being a constant complex number.\n\nIf the result of \\\\( L(f(z)) \\\\) is known, can the original complex number \\\\( z \\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Given the form of \\\\( L(f(z)) = A(e^{cz}) + b \\\\), the non-linearity and potential non-injectiveness of the exponential function combined with the addition of vector \\( b \\) and action of \\( A \\) generally prevent the unique determination of \\\\( z \\) from \\\\( L(f(z)) \\\\).",
