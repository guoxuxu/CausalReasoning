  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also define a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant and t represents time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha \\\\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) initially, but as t increases, the factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) changes the magnitude and possibly the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory compared to simple evolution by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
