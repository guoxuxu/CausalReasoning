  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is defined as the Laplace transform. We examine the effects this transformation has on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filtering transformation that alters frequencies is applied before converting back to the time domain, will the resulting function remain the same as \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional filtering transformation modifies the characteristics of the frequency domain representation, specifically altering the magnitudes and/or phases of specific frequencies. This change will affect the time domain representation upon applying the inverse Laplace transform, resulting in a function different from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
