  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = z^2 + cz \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We study how the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, influences the function over time t.\n\nIf a modifying function \\\\( k(z) = z + d \\\\) (where d is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the altered function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by the original differential equation parameters, ignoring the effects of d and s from the original transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) affects the trajectory and final conditions of the function by altering its state at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Both the integral transform's parameter s and the intervention d influence the evolved state at time T through their effects on z’s trajectory and endpoint.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences its future state z(t + Δt) through the differential equation z(t) → z^2 and z(t) → cz. The integral transformation h(z) is determined by z(t), indicating that h(z) is influenced by the state of z(t). The modifying function k(z) alters z(t) to influence future states, specifically z(T) for T > t_1, by adding d. The parameters d and s from the original transformation do not influence z(T) after t_1, as the future state relies on the differential equation's parameters instead.",
