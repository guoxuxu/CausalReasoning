  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state in the complex plane. We assess the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is observed, can we determine exactly which transformations \\(f(z)\\) and/or \\\\(g(z)\\) were applied, based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to distinguish whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), either, or both were applied, due to the potential equivalence in their effects over one cycle in complex exponential rotation, and the general non-linearities introduced by complex exponentiation.",
