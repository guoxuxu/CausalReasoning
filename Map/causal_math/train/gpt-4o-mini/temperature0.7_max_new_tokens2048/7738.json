  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier transformed state \\\\( z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing whether the modulation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the modulation, one cannot reliably infer \\\\( x(t) \\\\) because the frequency shift introduced by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) (transforming to \\\\( z(\\\\omega - ia) \\\\)) would be indiscernible if one assumes the signal unmodulated, leading to potential misinterpretation of the spectral data.",
