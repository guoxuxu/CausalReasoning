  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered over time t, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by scaling the magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Therefore, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is different due to the exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), which scales the magnitude differently over time compared to the purely oscillatory behavior under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\).",
