  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the system's transfer function in the Laplace domain. Suppose there's a sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\), and we are investigating the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) after processing through the system.\n\nGiven the steady-state output, can we infer whether there was a change in the system's transfer function (from \\\\(H(s)\\\\) to \\\\(G(s)\\\\)), just by studying \\\\(y(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the output frequency content remains constant, the potential alterations in amplitude and phase due to different transfer functions (\\\\(H(s)\\\\) versus \\\\(G(s)\\\\)) cannot be discerned solely from the output because such changes could also be replicated by different input amplitudes or phases in the context of a consistent transfer function.",
