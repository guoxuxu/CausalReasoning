  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = C e^{Dt} x \\\\), with C and D being constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) as the initial state vector. We explore the implications of performing a Laplace transform on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze the system in the s-domain, denoted as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = C(sI - D)^{-1}x \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by knowing the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( Z(s) = C(sI - D)^{-1}x_0 \\\\) allows for the calculation of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if C and D are known and \\\\((sI - D)^{-1}\\\\) is invertible. By inverting the operations properly, the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
