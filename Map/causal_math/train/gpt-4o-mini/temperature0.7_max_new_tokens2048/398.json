  "Problem": "Investigate the influence of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on the function space \\\\( u(x) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is characterized by a differential equation \\\\( L[u] = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\) with a boundary condition \\\\( u(0) = u(1) = 0 \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant scalar. We examine how transformations including \\\\( u(x) = v(x)e^{\\\\alpha x} \\\\) with a constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) affect the function space.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( v(x) \\\\) at x = 1, can we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( v(x) = u(x)e^{-\\\\alpha x} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation, one cannot unequivocally revert \\\\( v(x) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = 0, as the transformation \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha x} \\\\) may have altered the function in a way that is not directly traceable from the observed state.",

The values of u at the boundaries, u(0) and u(1), are conditions for the function u(x). The linear operator L acts on the function u(x) to produce L[u].",
