  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is considered, which affects the function over time span [0, T].\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-2s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely a function of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not dependent on the specifics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as a new modifying factor means that the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\) is influenced by both transformations. Each applies a different damping effect, complicating the contributions of the original oscillator's frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to the final outcome. The sequential or overlapping effects of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) render the final state dependent on both transformations.",
