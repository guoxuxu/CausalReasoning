  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. This function is subjected to an integral transform, specifically a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven that the Fourier transform of a function results in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - (w+a)) \\\\), can we specifically identify that the function was intervened by multiplying with \\\\( e^{iat} \\\\) before transforming?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier transform indicates a shift from \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w + a \\\\), multiple interventions (like different phase shifts or added frequencies) could yield the same transformation effect. Without additional data, the specific intervention of multiplying by \\\\( e^{iat} \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified.",
