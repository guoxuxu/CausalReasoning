  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), where \\( t \\) is time. We evaluate the integration of this function transformed by a differential operator \\( D \\) such that \\( Dz = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}z \\), for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nIf \\( Dz \\) is applied to the function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) for \\( n = 1 \\), and then allowed to evolve over time without further intervention, does \\( Dz(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) represent the original \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( Dz \\) at \\( n = 1 \\) results in \\( ie^{it} \\), which is the first derivative and transforms the function into its derivative state. Thus, \\( Dz(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) does not represent the original function \\( z(t) \\), instead it represents its derivative at that time.",
