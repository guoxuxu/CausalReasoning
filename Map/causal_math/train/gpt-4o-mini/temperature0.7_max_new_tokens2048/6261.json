  "Problem": "Analyzing an electrical system described by the voltage-current relationship using Laplace Transformations. Let \\\\( V(s) = Z(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( V(s) \\\\), \\\\( I(s) \\\\), and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of voltage, current, and impedance, respectively. Consider varying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by adding a capacitor with impedance \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\\\), where C is the capacitance.\n\nIf the impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is initially \\\\( sL \\\\) (pure inductor), and then a capacitor is added to the system so that the new impedance is \\\\( Z(s) = sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\\\), will the voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) at some time s = S be the same compared to when it is computed with only the inductor present?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the capacitor changes the overall impedance of the system. Thus, even for the same input current \\\\( I(s) \\\\), the voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) will not be the same due to the altered impedance profile, changing from \\\\( sL \\\\) to \\\\( sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\\\).",
