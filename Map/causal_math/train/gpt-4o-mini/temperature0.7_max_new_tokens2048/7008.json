  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number and \\( t \\) is time. This function represents a point moving in a circle on the complex plane. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega' t} dt \\), on this function over the frequency domain \\( \\omega' \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) showing a shift from a delta function at \\( \\omega \\) to one at \\( \\omega + \\Delta \\), can we determine that the only intervention made was the change in \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although a direct shift in the delta function from \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega + \\Delta \\) strongly suggests an increase in the frequency \\( \\omega \\) by \\( \\Delta \\), it cannot conclusively prove that no other modifications (such as amplitude scaling or additional phase shifts) were applied unless additional information is provided. The delta function shift is indicative but not exhaustive of possible transformations.",
