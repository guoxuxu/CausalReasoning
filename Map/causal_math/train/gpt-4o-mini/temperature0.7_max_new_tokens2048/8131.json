  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) representing a complex valued function, where \\\\( z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\\\). We analyze the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ h(z) \\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) also belongs to the complex plane.\n\nIf, after the initial Laplace transform, an additional filtering function \\\\( G(s) = \\frac{1}{s + \\alpha} \\\\) (with \\\\( \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\alpha > 0 \\\\)) is convolved with \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the resulting function have poles only where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) originally had?",
  "Explanation": "Convolving \\\\( H(s) \\\\) with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain constitutes a multiplication, which essentially adds the pole(s) of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) to those of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). If \\\\( H(s) \\\\) originally had poles at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\), the resulting function will also have a pole at \\\\( s = -\\alpha \\\\) due to the multiplication by \\\\( G(s) \\\\). This alters the pole structure and introduces new dynamics in the transformed domain.",
