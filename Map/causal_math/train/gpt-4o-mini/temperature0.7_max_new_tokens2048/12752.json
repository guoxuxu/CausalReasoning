  "Problem": "Consider the evaluation of the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\\\cos(tx) \\\\, dx \\\\) changing the variable x through the transformation \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants and analyzing the impact on the function's behaviour.\n\nIf \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( u \\\\) upfront and then the integral \\\\( I \\\\) is computed, does the result change from the standard Gauss integral without such variable shift?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the variable will not only shift but also scale the values of \\\\( x \\\\) contributing in the integral. The constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) affect the limits and the integrand itself leading to a potential difference in the outcome especially due to the \\\\( cos(tx) \\\\) term which becomes \\\\( cos(t(ax+b)/a) \\\\), thus affecting the resultant integral's value.",
