  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system wherein time-series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a convolution with a kernel function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(\\\\tau)h(t - \\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). We explore the impact of the Laplace Transform on this convolution and its causal inference under several scenarios.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the output signal \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) \\\\), and knowing the kernel's transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\) without knowing the form of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\) is invertible, then \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) / \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\). This operation is valid under typical conditions where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is known and invertible in the Laplace domain, allowing us to deduce \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from the transformed output.",
