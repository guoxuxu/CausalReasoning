  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} f(s) ds \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-2i \\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention and then \\\\( T \\\\) is reapplied, will the resultant signal \\\\( T[h](T) \\\\) at T be solely dependent on the initial \\\\( z(t) \\\\) regardless of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the original signal, introducing a new frequency component which, when subjected once again to \\\\( T \\\\), results in a transformed signal dependent on both the original and the intervening function. The final output \\\\( T[h](T) \\\\) combines effects from multiple frequency modulations.",
