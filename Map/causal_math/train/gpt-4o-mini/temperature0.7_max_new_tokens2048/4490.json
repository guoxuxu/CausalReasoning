  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\), aiming to analyze the consequences of employing a time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t) \\) where \\( \\\\alpha \\) is a scaling factor.\n\nIf we have the Laplace Transform of \\(g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t)\\), can we uniquely determine \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\\\alpha\\) just from \\(L(g)(s)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\(L(g)(s)\\) provides the transformed function scaled by \\(\\\\alpha\\), but it does not provide enough information to uniquely determine both \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\\\alpha\\) without additional constraints or data.",
