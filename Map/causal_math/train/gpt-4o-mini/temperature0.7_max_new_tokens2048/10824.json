  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the result of the Fourier transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after applying an intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\), is it possible to discern whether only \\\\( f(z) \\\\), only \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both transformations were applied by analyzing the output?",
  "Explanation": "The modifications imposed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) overlap in the frequency domain, mixing the components in a way that makes it ambiguous and complex to distinguish between the effects of one or both operations solely from the Fourier transform output.",
