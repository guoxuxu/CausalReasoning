  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We investigate the behavior of this system when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is set and the system evolves under its intrinsic dynamics until time t = T without any intervention, will the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T still reflect the properties of the original system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) integrates the effect of the exponential function on the system's trajectory over time, which modifies the outcome. The integral accumulates phase-influenced contributions from \\\\( z(s) \\\\), substantially altering the expected result compared to the direct evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
