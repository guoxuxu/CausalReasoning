  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant complex frequency. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied, resulting in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is the initial function and allowed to pass through the Fourier transform without further intervention, will the resulting spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\) be non-zero?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega' - \\\\omega) \\\\), which is non-zero exactly at \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\). Therefore, at the frequency matching \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the spectrum is non-zero, indicative of the presence of that frequency component in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
