  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nCan we determine the exact initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially, any deductions about \\\\( z_0 \\\\) are unclear since the early application of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could alter \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a way that is not reconstructible simply from knowing the dynamics under \\\\( At \\\\).",
