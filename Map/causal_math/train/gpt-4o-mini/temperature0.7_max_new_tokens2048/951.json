  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We consider the impact of an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\) applied to \\( z \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a real constant.\n\nIf a new transformation \\( S(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\beta s}z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\( \\beta \\) is a real constant) is introduced at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), will the outcome at \\( T \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( \\alpha \\) or \\( \\beta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( S(z) \\) affects the outcome at \\( T \\) by adding a competing or modifying exponential factor. Thus, the result would not solely depend on \\( \\omega \\) but also on the interaction and integration involving \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).",
