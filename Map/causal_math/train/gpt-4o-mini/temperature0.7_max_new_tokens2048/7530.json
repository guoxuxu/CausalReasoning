  "Problem": "Consider the mathematical system where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real number, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier transform result \\\\( F(z) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - A) \\\\), can we confidently claim that the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) without considering other potential forms for \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the observed result suggests a specific frequency \\\\( A \\\\), the original function could have been any function composed of the frequency \\\\( A \\\\) including multiples or phase-shifted versions, due to the linearity and time-invariance properties of the Fourier transform.",
