  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is determined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. The transformations used are \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and an external force represented by \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nCan the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( f(x) \\\\) squares the position at t = 0, without knowing if this operation took place, one cannot distinguish between having started from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( -x_0 \\\\), as both would give the same \\\\( x_0^2 \\\\). Hence, the exact initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be unambiguously determined.",
