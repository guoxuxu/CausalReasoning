  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(t, y(t)) = \\\\int_0^T k(t, s) y(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a function of time evolved from initial conditions under some autonomous differential equation. We test causal reasoning about the impact of modifying the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the kernel function \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) to another kernel function \\\\( k''(t, s) \\\\) at a time t_1 (0 < t_1 < T), will the transformed output \\\\( g(T, y(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend on the original kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) or just on \\\\( k''(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( g(T, y(T)) \\\\) will depend on both the original kernel function and the intervened kernel, as the overall transformation up to time T is affected by contributions from both kernel functions within their respective time intervals. The nature of the integral transformation accumulates effects over time.",
