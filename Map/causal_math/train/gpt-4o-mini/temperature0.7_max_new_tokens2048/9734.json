  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We investigate the behavior of this system when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be deduced solely from knowing \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), where T > 0, without any additional system information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) represents an integral of the system's state influenced by the exponential function, it encompasses a range of states from \\\\( 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\ ) rather than a specific state at a specific time. This integration masks the direct influence of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by including all prior states, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
