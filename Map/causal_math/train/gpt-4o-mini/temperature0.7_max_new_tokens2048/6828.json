  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. To analyze this scenario, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) at different times.\n\nAfter observing the transformation output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and knowing an intervention changed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we ascertain whether the intervention occurred before or after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone does not provide information about the timing of the intervention related to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) integrates over the function potentially both before and after the intervention, it can encompass effects from both the original and altered parameters, making it unclear when the intervention occurred.",
