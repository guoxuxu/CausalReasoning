  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) - By(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y}(t) = Bx(t) + Ay(t) \\\\), with A and B being constants. Let's examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nSuppose at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with another function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and B, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on A, B, C, and D due to the additional transformation by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) affecting the trajectory. Both transformations, \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), will influence the system's path and, consequently, the state at time T.",
