  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in a two-dimensional plane over time t. The transformation defined by the integral \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T without knowing the value of s?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation includes the complex exponent \\\\( s \\\\), which could variably alter the amplitude and phase of each element within \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without the exact value of s, the inverse transformation to retrieve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is not uniquely defined, leading to ambiguous reconstructions of the original function.",
