  "Problem": "Investigate a system under the effect of a linear transformation expressed through the matrix exponential. The system is defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, and the impact of transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nIs it possible to reconstruct the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, trying to infer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is indeterminate due to the potential transformation inflicted by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). The differential contributive effects of D and M make it impossible to reliably backtrack the initial state.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M causes the initial state z to evolve over time to the state z(t), while the transformation g(z) applies the matrix D to the initial state z, resulting in the observed state z(t). The observed state z(t) can be used to infer the initial condition z_0, but without knowledge of whether g(z) was applied, this reconstruction may be ambiguous.",
