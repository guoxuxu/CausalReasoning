  "Problem": "Consider the complex plane where functions are mapped using a transformation \\\\( z' = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) indicates time. Analyze the impact of this transformation under the integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), reflecting a periodic adjustment over time T.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time T, can we pinpoint whether an intervention altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) occurred, based purely on the known result?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the presence of an intervention, like a change in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), solely based on the result of the integral transformation is not feasible, as different combinations of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), T, and interventions could potentially result in the same outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The information about the transformations is lost in the integration over time.",
