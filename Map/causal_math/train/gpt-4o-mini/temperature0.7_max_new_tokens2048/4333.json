  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed using the Fourier transform without any modifications, will the resulting \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\) at a different frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\neq \\\\omega \\\\) be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a pure frequency component \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). For any \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\neq \\\\omega \\\\), the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\) evaluates to zero, indicating no component of the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) in the original signal.",
