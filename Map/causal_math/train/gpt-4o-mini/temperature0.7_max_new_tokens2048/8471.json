  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) \\) evolving over time according to \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\) applied at different time points.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(z) = e^{-i\\omega t} z \\) (where \\( -i\\omega \\) is a modification to the phase evolution) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on \\( \\omega \\) and not on the phase transformations introduced by \\( f(z) \\) or \\( g(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(z) \\) introduces another phase-adjusting factor which alters the subsequent trajectory of \\( z(t) \\). Because both \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) can affect the phase state of \\( z \\), the final state \\( z(T) \\) will depend not only on \\( \\omega \\) but also on the impacts of these transformations. This alteration complicates determining \\( z(T) \\) based solely on natural evolution under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\).",
