  "Problem": "Consider a quantum system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system. We examine changes due to the operation of the unitary transformation \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iH't} \\\\), where \\\\( H' \\\\) is another Hamiltonian.\n\nIf \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( U(0)\\\\psi_0 = \\\\psi_0 \\\\), but as t increases, the effect of the differing Hamiltonian \\\\( H' \\\\) alters the evolution trajectory of \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\), leading to a state at time T that is generally different from just the evolution under H alone.",
