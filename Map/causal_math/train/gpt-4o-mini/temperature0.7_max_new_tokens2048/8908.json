  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its impact when integrated over a contour in the complex plane. The contour described by the path \\\\( C \\\\) is parameterized by \\\\( z(t) = a + te^{it} \\\\) for \\\\( t \\\\) ranging from 0 to 2\\\\pi, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the final integral value after the application of \\\\( g(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) at some point on \\\\( C \\\\), can we conclusively determine which function (\\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) was used at every point along \\\\( C \\\\) solely based on the integral value?",
  "Explanation": "Various combinations of extents of \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) along the contour could yield the same or similar integral values. The overlap in potential ranges covered by these functions makes it impossible to accurately trace which function was applied at every segment of the contour solely based on the final integral value.",
