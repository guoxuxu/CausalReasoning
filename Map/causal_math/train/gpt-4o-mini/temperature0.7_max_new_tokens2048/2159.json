  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) by a different exponential decay \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\) (where \\( \\beta \\neq \\alpha \\)) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the final Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t \\to \\infty \\) be independent of the initial \\( \\alpha \\)-decay?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform will exhibit characteristics influenced by both exponential decays \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) and \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\). The effects of these alterations do not cancel out but rather accumulate, leading to compounded shifts and broadening in the frequency spectrum.",
