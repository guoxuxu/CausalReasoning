  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a vector differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\), where K is a matrix diagonalizing D (i.e., \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\)), and L is a diagonal matrix, is applied to observe its behavior under system evolution.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) (where M is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "The system, after being affected by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), does not only evolve according to D. The intervening application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory by introducing a new dynamic characterized by matrix M, thereby making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a compound result of D and M.",
