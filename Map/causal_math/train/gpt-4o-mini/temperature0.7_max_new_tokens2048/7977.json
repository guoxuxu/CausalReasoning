  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega \\tau}z(\\tau)d\\tau\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from \\\\(t = 0\\\\) to \\\\(t = T\\\\) and allowed to evolve without further transformation, will the transformed state at \\\\(t = T\\\\) represent the simple accumulation of the original states over time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) effectively changes the nature of the function by performing a convolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) with \\\\(e^{-i\\omega t}\\\\), which does not merely accumulate but transforms the weighting of the function's contributions over time, affecting the entire structure and output at \\\\(t = T\\\\).",
