  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix and z is a complex variable. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) on the behavior of the system.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at z = 0 be reconstructed exactly from observing the result at z = Z after applying the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the integral transformation adds an accumulation of the function over an interval, it modifies the original function's output in an irreversible way that does not allow exact backward reconstruction without additional information.",
