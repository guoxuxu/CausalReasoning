  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega t} w \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The system under study is defined by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation on the system evolution.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\\\( z(w) \\\\), \\\\( h(w) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( w(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations of the interventions due to the properties of complex exponentials and the possible interactions between \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\theta t} \\\\). The non-uniqueness in potential trajectories and transformations precludes precisely identifying which interventions were applied.",
