  "Problem": "We are studying a complex function \\\\( z = f(x+iy) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( f \\\\) is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = z + B \\\\) (with B as a constant complex matrix) affect the output of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to transform it to \\\\( f(z_0 + B) \\\\), and then this result evolves over time according to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), does \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) for any later time \\\\( t \\\\) remain the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been directly used in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the input to \\\\( f \\\\) by adding \\\\( B \\\\), leading to a different initial condition \\\\( f(z_0 + B) \\\\). As such, the evolution of the function will follow a different trajectory due to the change in the input, regardless of the properties of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",
