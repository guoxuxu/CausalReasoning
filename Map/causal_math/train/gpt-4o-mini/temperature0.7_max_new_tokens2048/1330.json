  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We evaluate the effect of transformation by another function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nCan we infer the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the phase or magnitude change induced by \\\\( z^2 \\\\) would make it impossible to confidently backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Observing \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) without this knowledge could correspond to multiple initial conditions depending on whether or not a transformation was applied.",
