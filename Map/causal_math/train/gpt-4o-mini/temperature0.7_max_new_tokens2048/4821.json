  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where f(t) represents a time-dependent function and s is a complex number. An input signal f(t) is being studied for its transformation and response properties under different conditions and manipulations.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where a is a real number, is transformed by the Laplace transform without any alterations, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) provided Re(s) > a?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) directly yields \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) assuming Re(s) > a as per the definition and properties of the Laplace transform. The direct application of the transform yields a predictable and deterministic outcome without any interventions.",
