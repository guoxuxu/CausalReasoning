  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nIf at \\\\( z_2 \\\\), an operation \\\\( g(w) = e^{Bw} \\\\) (where B is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of the system at \\\\( z_1 \\\\) for \\\\( z_1 > z_2 \\\\) compute as if only the \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) was integral transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of applying \\\\( g(w) \\\\) at \\\\( z_2 \\\\) alters the problem setup significantly. While the original system was affected only by way of A, the introduction of B at a mid-point introduces another layer of complexity, making the behavior dependent on both A and B.",
