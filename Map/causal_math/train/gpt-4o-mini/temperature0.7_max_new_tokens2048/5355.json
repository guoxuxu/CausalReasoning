  "Problem": "Investigate a system under the effect of a linear transformation expressed through the matrix exponential. The system is defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, and the impact of transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf at some point t_1, the state \\\\( z \\\\) is intervened upon by a new transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\), where F is another constant matrix, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend only on M, ignorant of D and F?",
  "Explanation": "Using the intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another variable into the system, affecting the end state at t = T. The transformations due to \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) at the initial condition and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) during intervention ensure that the final state not only depends on M but significantly on D and F as well.",
