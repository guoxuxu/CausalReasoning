  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variable t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x \\\\). We examine modifications introduced by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) before T, another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the initial equations without considering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after \\\\( f(z) \\\\) effectively introduces opposite rotations at different times, influencing the trajectory and potentially undoing or altering the effects of the initial transformation at specific instances. Consequently, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the interplay between both transformations and their frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), alongside the path dictated by the original differential equations.",
