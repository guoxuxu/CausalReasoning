  "Problem": "Consider a function h(z) defined over the complex plane, and let's apply a Fourier transform on this function, denoted as H(w), to analyze its behavior in frequency space.\n\nIf after obtaining H(w), we apply an inverse Fourier transform on H(w) modified by a Gaussian function exp(-aw^2), will the resulting function still resemble the original h(z) in terms of its core properties of polynomial degree?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the Gaussian modulation exp(-aw^2) in the frequency domain alters the original function's structure due to convolution effects, changing its nature when transformed back from frequency to spatial domain. This results in changes to the polynomial's nature and degree.",
