  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\(dz = Pz \\, dt\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. Investigate the implications of applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\) over time \\(t\\), with \\(Q\\) also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), we apply another intervention \\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\) (where \\( R \\) is another constant matrix), does the resulting state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) rely only on \\( P \\) and not \\( Q \\) or \\( R \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventional application of \\( h(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces an additional altering vector flow. Consequently, the final state \\( z(T) \\) will be a function of \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), and \\( R \\). The transformations \\( e^{Qt} \\) and \\( e^{Rt} \\) affect the system's trajectory, imparting dependency from all matrices.",
