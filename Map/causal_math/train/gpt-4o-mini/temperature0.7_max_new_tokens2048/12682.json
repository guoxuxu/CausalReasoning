  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its implications over the variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf an operator \\\\( L[f](t) = f'(t) + bf(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) after the original transformation \\\\( T \\\\), will the new endpoint depend solely on \\\\( s \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) changes the nature and the trajectory of the function. \\\\( L[g](t) = a e^{at} + b e^{at} = (a+b) e^{at} \\\\), and then taking \\\\( T[L[g]](s) \\\\) would yield \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\), thus showing dependence on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), alongside \\\\( s \\\\).",
