  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform applied to a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\), and let the transformed function be \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\). Assume the operation of convolution with another function \\\\(g(x)\\\\) in the time domain, consequently leading to a multiplication by \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\(g(x)\\\\), in the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is convolved with \\\\(g(x)\\\\) and then Fourier transformed, will \\\\(F(\\\\omega)G(\\\\omega)\\\\), the product of their individual transforms, be the exact result of the Fourier transform on the convolved function?",
  "Explanation": "By the convolution theorem, convolving two functions in the time domain equals multiplying their Fourier transforms in the frequency domain. Thus, \\\\(F(\\\\omega)G(\\\\omega)\\\\) will indeed be the Fourier transform of \\\\(f(x) * g(x)\\\\), where '*' denotes convolution.",
