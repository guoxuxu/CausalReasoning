  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\\\) where A is a matrix and v is a complex constant vector. The system is then subjected to a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( v \\\\) be precisely determined from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the matrix A or the functional form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( v \\\\) from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without the details of A is ambiguous since the exponential and Fourier transformations mask the original properties of \\\\( v \\\\) under layers of mathematical operations that depend sensitively on A.",
