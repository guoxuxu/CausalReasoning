  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We introduce a transformation \\\\(T(x) = Mx\\\\) where \\\\(M\\\\) is also a matrix that modifies the system prior to solving for \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(x) = Mx\\\\) is applied to the system before solving for \\\\(x\\\\), will the solution \\\\(x\\\\) of the modified system \\\\(A(Mx) = b\\\\) be equivalent to the direct solution of the original system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(Mx\\\\) will generally modify the system of equations, leading to a different effective system \\\\(AMx = b\\\\). Unless \\\\(M\\\\) is the inverse of \\\\(A\\\\) or commutes specifically with \\\\(A\\\\) to simplify back to \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), the solution will not be the same.",
