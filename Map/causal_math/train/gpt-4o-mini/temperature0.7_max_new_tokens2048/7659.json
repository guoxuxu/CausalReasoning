  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf an operation altering the frequency spectrum of input, denoted by multiplying \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) (where A is a complex number), is applied at \\\\( t=0 \\\\), does the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes the Fourier transform of the input signal to \\\\( X(\\\\omega - A) \\\\). Hence, the output spectrum will now be \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega - A) \\\\), which clearly shows dependence on both the system's response and the parameter \\\\( A \\\\) from the intervention.",

The alteration of x(t) by multiplying it with e^(At) affects X(ω), which in turn influences Z(ω). Therefore, Z(ω) does depend on A through its effect on X(ω), indicating that Z(ω) is influenced by both H(ω) and the altered X(ω).",
