  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = a+bt+ict^2 \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants, and study the application of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are changed to \\\\( a', b', c' \\\\) at t = 0, and the function is allowed to evolve naturally, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) remain identical?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the coefficients \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) alters the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), producing modifications in the time-domain, which directly impact the frequency-domain representation. Thus, the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) will manifest these changes through different frequency components or amplitudes compared to the original.",
