  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical scenario where a signal x(t) undergoes a Fourier Transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt\\\\). Further, this transformed signal is modified via a filter function H(ω), and the composite effect \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is obtained by applying the Inverse Fourier Transform to \\\\(H(\\\\omega) \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf at time t_1, an additional filter K(ω) is applied to the system, will the output y(t) at T > t_1 solely rely on the original filter H(ω) without considering K(ω)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of a new filter K(ω) alters the system's behaviour by potentially modifying the frequency components of the existing system state. The final output y(T) depends on the composite effects of both H(ω) and K(ω), not merely the original H(ω).",
