  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nGiven a spectrum obtained from a Fourier Transform indicating a primary peak at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we conclude which specific interventions, such as amplitude scaling or phase shifting, were applied to the time-domain signal \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), based solely on the spectrum at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum shows the presence of the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but does not specifically reveal whether an amplitude scaling or a phase shifting intervention was applied. Both interventions alter the spectrum in ways that are not distinguishable purely based on the peak at \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
