  "Problem": "In this system, we consider the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We will explore the consequences of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Ke^{Mt}z\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(M\\\\) is another diagonalizable matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we infer the original vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without confirmation that \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\\\(K\\\\) and exponentials could modify the state in ways dependent on their alignment or misalignment with \\\\(D\\\\). Without knowing if \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was executed, it's infeasible to reconstruct \\\\(z_0\\\\) uniquely.",
