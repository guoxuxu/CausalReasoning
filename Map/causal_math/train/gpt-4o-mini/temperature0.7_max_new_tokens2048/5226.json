  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, on the function over a time interval is analyzed.\n\nOn observing the function at time \\\\( T \\\\) and knowing that \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), can we exactly deduce the function's form at earlier times without knowing if any transformation such as \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature and time-invariance of the differential equation, its future or past states can be uniquely determined from any present state assuming no additional transformation has affected the system. Any transformation like \\\\( T(z) \\\\) represents a separate computation that does not impact the system’s inherent dynamic.",
