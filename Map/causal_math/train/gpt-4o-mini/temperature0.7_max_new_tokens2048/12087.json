  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time t is modeled by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of applying a time-dependent heat source \\( S(x,t) = h(t) \\cdot \\cos(\\omega x) \\) along the rod.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\) at t = 10, can we determine precisely whether the change in thermal diffusivity at t = 5 was the only intervention applied, based on the observed temperature distribution?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions could potentially lead to the same observed temperature distribution at T = 10, such as different combinations of heat source functions or changes in thermal diffusivity at different times. The final temperature distribution alone does not uniquely identify the events or conditions leading up to it due to the variability and complexities in the heat transfer processes.",
