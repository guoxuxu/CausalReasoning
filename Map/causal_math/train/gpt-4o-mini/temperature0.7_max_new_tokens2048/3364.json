  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz + d \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, on the function \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( f(Z) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( T(z), S(z), \\\\) or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( f(Z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multitude of possibilities for choosing parameters \\\\( c, d, e, f \\\\) leading to potentially equivalent outputs of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine which transformations or their combination were applied merely from the final function value. Each set of parameters can induce variations that result in the same \\\\( f(Z) \\\\).",
