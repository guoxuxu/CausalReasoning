  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. A transformation involving a complex function \\\\(f(z) = Re(z^2)\\\\), where \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), is applied, influencing the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nAfter observing the potential function \\\\(u(x, y, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we infer the original non-transformed boundary conditions at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without knowing about the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge that \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied to the boundary conditions, an observer cannot determine the original state, as the transformation significantly alters the potential distribution and masks the original conditions.",
