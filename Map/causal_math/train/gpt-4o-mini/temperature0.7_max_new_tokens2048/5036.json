  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network governed by the Laplace Transform of a complex function \\(\\overline{V}(s) = H(s)\\overline{I}(s)\\), where \\(H(s)\\) represents the system's transfer function and \\(\\overline{V}(s)\\) and \\(\\overline{I}(s)\\) are the Laplace transforms of the voltage and current, respectively. Suppose a filter with a specific impulse response \\( g(t) \\) characterized by its transfer function \\( G(s) \\) is introduced into the network.\n\nGiven the final state \\( \\overline{V}(T) \\), can we ascertain whether \\( G(s) \\) was in effect at any moment if \\( H(s) \\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interaction between \\( H(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\), multiple configurations of \\( G(s) \\) (different timings, durations, or characteristics) could lead to the same \\( \\overline{V}(T) \\). Therefore, without additional information, it's unclear if \\( G(s) \\) impacted the network or at what period.",
