  "Problem": "Consider a linear system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the implications of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the system, affecting the solution characteristics over time t.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Fourier transform was applied, it's challenging to reverse engineer the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) because the transform could have altered the frequency spectrum, impacting how L acts on the original function.",
