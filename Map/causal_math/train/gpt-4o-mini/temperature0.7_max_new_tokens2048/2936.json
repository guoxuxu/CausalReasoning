  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the impact of the linear transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing transformations were applied, can we determine the specific transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) used on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) purely based on the endpoint at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ambiguity in how \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) affect the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) means multiple combinations of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) could result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the transformations applied during the evolution.",
