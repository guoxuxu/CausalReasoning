  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate changes in the function given by the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\), applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t; t_1, \\delta)\\}(s) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely the values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) used in the intervention based solely on \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformed function provides clues about shifts in frequency, the overlapping effects of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( \\delta \\\\) contribute to a non-unique solution in determining both values distinctly without additional constraints or data.",
