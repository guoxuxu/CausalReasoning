  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) defined on a contour in the complex plane. The contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) is analyzed over a closed path C. Let \\\\( a \\\\) be a complex constant.\n\nGiven the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\), can we determine the specific value of \\\\( a \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral alone, especially in complex function contexts, does not uniquely determine \\\\( a \\\\), as different values can lead to the same integral due to the periodic properties of the exponential function and the specific geometry of C.",
