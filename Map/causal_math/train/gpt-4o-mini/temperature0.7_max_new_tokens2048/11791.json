  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real number. To analyze causal effects, we introduce interventions using the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we determine exactly what interventions were applied, whether it be \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both, by only analyzing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions (\\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\)) can lead to the same output state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) due to the properties of complex exponentials. This overlap implies that knowing the endpoint alone does not provide sufficient information to definitively identify the nature or sequence of interventions applied.",
