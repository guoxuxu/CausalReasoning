  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine precisely if an intervention by multiplying \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) was applied to the input signal, just by analyzing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) itself, without additional information about the transformation \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) or the nature of alterations applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\), doesn't provide sufficient information to uniquely determine whether the specific intervention \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) was used. Various combinations of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and alterations could result in the same output spectrum.",
