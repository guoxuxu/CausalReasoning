  "Problem": "Assume we have a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) following the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. At time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, is applied.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex constant, is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the trajectory at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) only depend on the original system parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity affecting the trajectory. The final state at time \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on all three parameters: \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). This dependency arises because both transformations modify the magnitude and potentially the direction of the state vector depending on the complex plane.",
