  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled with Laplace transforms in the complex function space, where the transfer function H(s) relates the input U(s) to the output Y(s) by Y(s) = H(s)U(s). Let's investigate how the addition of a complex pole affects the system behavior.\n\nBy observing Y(s) after interventions (adding a pole, and modifying U(s) at s_0), can we conclusively determine the presence and impact of each intervention across all s?",
  "Explanation": "The combined effects of adding a pole to H(s) and modulating U(s) at a specific s create a complex influence on Y(s), which depends on the interplay and specific compensation mechanisms. The resulting output Y(s) does not uniquely determine or elucidate each intervention's specific impact without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
