  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a vector space given by the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) which projects vectors onto a subspace. We explore the effects of applying another linear transformation \\\\( Q \\\\), which is a rotation matrix, on this vector space.\n\nGiven the final state of a vector at time T, can we determine the sequence of transformations (projection followed by rotation vs. rotation followed by projection) applied to the vector at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of the vector alone, without knowing the original state or the details of the transformations, is not enough to clearly determine the sequence of transformations due to the non-commutative nature of general matrix multiplication.",
