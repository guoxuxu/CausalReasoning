  "Problem": "Examine the steady-state behavior of a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real valued function satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) for a constant matrix A, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. Consider the Fourier transform applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and its interactions.\n\nIf a time-varying phase shift described by \\\\( e^{i\\\\delta t} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) is a constant, is introduced as an intervention at time t_1, will the resulting Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 only depend on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced phase shift modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta) t} x(t) \\\\) for t > t_1. This results in a further shift in the frequency spectrum by \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\). Therefore, the final Fourier transform depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\).",
