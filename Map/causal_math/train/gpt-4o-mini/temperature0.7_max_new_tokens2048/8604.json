  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system governed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of a holomorphic transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is considered over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowledge the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention combinations can lead to the same result at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the non-injective nature of the transformations such as squaring and square root functions in the complex domain. Therefore, identical endpoints may arise from different sequences of interventions, creating ambiguity.",
