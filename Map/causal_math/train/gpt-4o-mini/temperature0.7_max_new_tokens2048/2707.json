  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Assume the dynamic of the function is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), with M being a constant 2x2 real matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{N(t-T)}z \\\\) (where N is a different constant 2x2 matrix) is introduced, and then the system continues to evolve, does the outcome at time T depend solely on M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system by introducing the dynamics associated with another matrix N. Thus, the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will now depend on both M from its initial dynamics and N from the intervention applied.",
