  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We explore the effects of pre-multiplying the input signal by a modulation function \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nKnowing the transformed result \\\\( X(s) \\\\), can we infer the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty if the modulation \\\\( m(t) \\\\) was applied, one would not know to adjust the Laplace variable \\\\( s \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\) (i.e., transforming \\\\( X(s+a) \\\\) back to \\\\( X(s) \\\\)). Incorrectly assuming the presence or absence of modulation results in an incorrect inverse transformation, hence an incorrect inference of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
