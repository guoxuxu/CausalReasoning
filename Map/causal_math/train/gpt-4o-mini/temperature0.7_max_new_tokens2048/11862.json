  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is analyzed under the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being a constant phase shift.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is another constant phase) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\theta \\\\), and \\\\( \\phi \\\\). The initial phase shift \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and the later phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\) interact, influencing the trajectory and final state.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The time variable t influences the function z(t), which is determined by the constant frequency ω. The function z(t) is transformed by g(z) through the phase shift θ, resulting in the new function affecting the endpoint z(T). Additionally, the intervention h(z) also influences z(T) through the phase φ. Hence, z(T) is influenced by both the original frequency ω and the phase shifts θ and φ.",
