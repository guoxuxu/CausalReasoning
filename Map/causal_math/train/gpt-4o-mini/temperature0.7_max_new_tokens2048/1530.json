  "Problem": "Examine a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. The transformation considered is through the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition.\n\nAfter observing the function \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we confirm whether the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) was applied to the initial function despite not intervening in the PDE's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The solution of the PDE in either transformed or original space leads to similar functional forms upon transformation back to the original space. Without additional information about the intermediate states, determining the use of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) from the final observation at \\\\(T\\\\) is indiscernible.",
