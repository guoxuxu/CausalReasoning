  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is directly subjected to the Fourier transform without any modifications, will the result \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) \\\\) be a delta function centered at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is indeed a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\\\). This indicates that the transform acts as an identity over the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\), perfectly capturing the unique frequency present in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
