  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), and A and B are scalar constants. We explore causal relationships under the Fourier transform defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nCan we determine explicitly what interventions were applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), given only the transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\) encodes information about the frequency content and general trends affected by interventions, but it does not provide explicit details about which interventions (scaling, shifts, etc.) were applied, due to the loss of specifics about time-domain interaction details.",
