  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves without further changes, does the transformation affect the nature of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at a later time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) computes the integral of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from 0 to T, which is independent of the function's ongoing form. The nature of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), which is purely based on the exponential function at a specific time T, remains unaffected by the previous integral evaluation.",
