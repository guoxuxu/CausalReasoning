  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} - ci \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are real constants.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially defined at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and evolves up to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without any external intervention, will the function subjected to \\\\( D \\\\) yield the same result as \\\\( e^{(a+bi)T} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), we get \\\\( Dz(t) = (a+bi-ci)e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), which implies the evolution under \\\\( D \\\\), modifies the phase of the exponential, resulting in a different function compared to the original \\\\( e^{(a+bi)T} \\\\) due solely to the influence of the term \\\\( -ci \\\\).",
