  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is analyzed over the time domain.\n\nKnowing the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) till time \\\\( T \\\\), can the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) be uniquely determined, without knowledge about whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( T \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely reverse the influence of the convolution with \\\\( e^{C(t-\\\\tau)} \\\\) which could have adjusted \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in multiple ways, depending on C's relationship to A and B.",
