  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which represents a unit circle in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer, on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the trajectory's representation in the complex plane at time t = T, can we precisely deduce if interventions such as \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both, were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) affect only the rate of traversal but not the path, multiple combinations of n and m can lead to the same frequency at time T. Therefore, we cannot uniquely identify the specific transformations or their sequence just by observing the final frequency or state.",
