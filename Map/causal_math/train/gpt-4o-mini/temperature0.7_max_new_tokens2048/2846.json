  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function represents a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane. We examine the response of the system under a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), assuming no initial conditions.\n\nWith knowledge of the transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we uniquely identify the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed expression \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) and understanding of the Laplace transform properties, one can uniquely reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) via the inverse Laplace transform, assuming proper conditions like causality and stability are met.",
