  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation via a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\\\). Let's examine the effects of modifying the function in the frequency domain and then applying the inverse transformation to recover the signal in the time domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in the time domain is directly transformed to the frequency domain and back without any modification, will the recovered function in the time domain be identical to the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of the Fourier transform and its inverse, transforming a function to the frequency domain and back unaltered should perfectly reconstruct the original function, assuming the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) satisfies the necessary conditions for the Fourier inversion theorem.",
