  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to transform the contour of integration in the complex plane for an integral \\\\(I = \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), where \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is a holomorphic function and \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple closed contour.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( I' = \\\\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), can we infer the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) with certainty, without information on \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the transformation details or the nature of \\\\( a \\\\), it is impossible to revert \\\\( w(C) \\\\) to \\\\( C \\\\) as the mapping \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) might not be uniquely reversible due to its dependency on the complex parameter \\\\( a \\\\).",
