  "Problem": "Assess the effects of a Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant, and its impact on system behavior described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nWill the solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t) \\\\) remain identical if the initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is replaced by its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) \\\\) backtransformed to the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) \\\\) fundamentally alters the characteristics of the original function in the frequency domain. When transformed back, while theoretically an inverse Fourier transform should recover the original function, any practical application or numeric computation might introduce discrepancies, particularly under different system parameters like damping factor b.",
