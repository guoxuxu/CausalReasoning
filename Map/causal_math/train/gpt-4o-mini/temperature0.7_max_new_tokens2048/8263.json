  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation given by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\\\) where \\\\(W_t\\\\) is a standard Brownian motion, \\\\(\\mu\\\\) is the drift coefficient, and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) is the volatility coefficient. We explore the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( Z_t = e^{\\lambda t}X_t \\\\) for some constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification to the drift coefficient from \\\\(\\mu\\\\) to \\\\(\\mu'\\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the subsequent path of \\\\( Z_t \\\\) for t > t_1 depend only on the new \\\\(\\mu'\\\\) and not on the initial transformation constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The path of \\\\( Z_t \\\\) for t > t_1 will depend both on the new \\\\(\\mu'\\\\) and the constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). The scaling \\\\( e^{\\lambda t} \\\\) continues to influence the trajectory alongside the modified dynamics introduced by the new drift coefficient \\\\(\\mu'\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The variable X_t directly influences Z_t, while the drift coefficient mu affects the behavior of X_t. When the drift coefficient changes from mu to mu', it continues to affect X_t, which in turn influences Z_t. The transformation constant lambda is a multiplicative factor in the definition of Z_t and does not affect the dependency of Z_t on the new drift coefficient mu'.",
