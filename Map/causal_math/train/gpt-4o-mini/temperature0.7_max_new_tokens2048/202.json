  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a system governed by a set of linear differential equations \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable constant matrix. Investigate the effects of applying a transformation defined by the complex function \\( g(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, with \\(\\omega\\) representing a real constant frequency.\n\nCan we ascertain the initial state vector \\( x_0 \\) after observing \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of the transformation \\( g(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) modifies the initial state and could make it difficult or impossible to retrieve \\( x_0 \\) without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied, due to its complex exponential influence on the trajectory.",
