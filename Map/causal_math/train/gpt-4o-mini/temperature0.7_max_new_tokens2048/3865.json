  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a function space, defined as L[f(x)] = f''(x) - 4f(x). We are interested in how the use of an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform denoted by \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), affects the solutions of the differential equation L[f(x)] = 0.\n\nIf we take the Laplace Transform of a solution f(x) to the differential equation L[f(x)] = 0, does the transformed function solve a modified equation in the Laplace domain without further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform to a solution of the differential equation L[f(x)] = 0 converts it to a problem in the Laplace domain. Since \\( \\mathcal{L}[f''(x)] = s^2 F(s) - sf(0) - f'(0) \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L}[4f(x)] = 4F(s) \\), the transformed equation becomes \\( s^2 F(s) - sf(0) - f'(0) - 4F(s) = 0 \\), which is a new equation but correctly represents the original problem in the Laplace domain.",
