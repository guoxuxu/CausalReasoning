  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at different times.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of \\\\( M \\\\) after observing the transformed function at t = T without knowing the initial application of \\\\( Mz(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on the initial application of the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\), and given that the function evolves freely under \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), the exact form of \\\\( M \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced from the state at t = T due to the potential variations in \\\\( M \\\\) that could produce similar transformations at T.",
