  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + p(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a position-dependent velocity field. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a specific time.\n\nFrom the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) at any later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) without knowing how the system evolved, i.e., without knowing the function \\\\( p(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the exact original function \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) solely from its Fourier transform at a later time requires precise knowledge of the velocity field \\\\( p(x) \\\\), since \\\\( p(x) \\\\) significantly influences the evolution and distribution of energy among the Fourier modes.",
