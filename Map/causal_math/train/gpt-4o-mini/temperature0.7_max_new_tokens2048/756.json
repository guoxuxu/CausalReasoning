  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\) relating a time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to its s-domain representation. The causal effect of modifying the system's response by applying a convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) (whose Laplace transform is \\\\( G(s) \\\\)) is studied.\n\nAssuming that the final response of the system is given by the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we accurately determine which function (\\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( p(t) \\\\)) was applied as an intervention only by the observation of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) as either \\\\( F(s)G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( F(s)P(s) \\\\), without distinct information about \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( P(s) \\\\) or time of intervention, it is not possible to ascertain which function was actually involved, as multiple configurations could yield the same \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
