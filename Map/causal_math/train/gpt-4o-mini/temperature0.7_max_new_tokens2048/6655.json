  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\theta \\\\) is a constant phase shift.\n\nAssuming that at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a different transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{i \\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without influence from \\\\( \\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces an additional phase shift, which, along with the initial modification by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), affects the trajectory and final state at T. Thus, the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is affected by both \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\phi \\\\), not just the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex state z_0 influences the state z(t) over time, while the transformation h(z) applies a phase shift θ to z and alters its trajectory. The intervention k(z) applies another phase shift φ to z, also affecting its trajectory. Ultimately, the final state z(T) is influenced by both the initial conditions (through ω) and the transformations (h(z) and k(z)).",
