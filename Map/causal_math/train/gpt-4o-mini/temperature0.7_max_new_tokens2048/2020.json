  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) representing a control function. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where A is also a constant matrix.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at end time T and knowing the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\), is it possible to determine what controls (\\\\( u \\\\) or \\\\( v \\\\)) were applied and when, based solely on the endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately deduce what controls were applied and at what times due to the overlapping influence of the control inputs under the system dynamics over time. The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) further complicates this, blending the effects of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), \\\\( u \\\\), and \\\\( v \\\\) into the integral transformation.",
