  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapped in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants, over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( S(z) = Cz + D \\\\) (where C and D are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the exerted transformations and not on the initial state?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\\\( S(z) \\\\) interacts with the prior states and transformations, complicating the future state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Both the characteristics of the initial state and the effects of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\) influence the final condition at time T.",
