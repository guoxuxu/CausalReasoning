  "Problem": "Examine the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the coupled differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\) respectively. Consider the effect of the linear operator \\( L(z) = e^{Mt}z \\) where M is a constant matrix, applied at different intervals.\n\nIf \\( L(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to T under \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\( L(z) \\) changes the complex number, affecting how it evolves under the differential equations. The transformation by \\( e^{Mt} \\) can alter both magnitude and phase, leading to a different position in the complex plane at time T.",
