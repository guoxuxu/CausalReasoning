  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nIf a modulation by magnitude \\\\( A \\\\) and an additional constant phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\), represented as \\\\( g(t) = A e^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)} \\\\), is applied to the original signal as an intervention, will the Fourier Transform spectrum still indicate the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) predominantly?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the intervention by scalar amplitude \\\\( A \\\\) and phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\), the principal frequency component of the signal remains \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The Fourier Transform detects this component, although the spectrum would also reflect the introduced amplitude and phase shift effects.",
