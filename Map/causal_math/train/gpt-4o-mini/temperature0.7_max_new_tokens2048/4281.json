  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. This system is influenced by applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under the given differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) modifies the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( az_0 + b \\\\). Since the differential equation is non-linear and depends both on \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( z^2 \\\\), this altered initial condition results in a different trajectory and final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
