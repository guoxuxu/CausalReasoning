  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the temperature distribution, u(x,t), in a rod over time t is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) represents a cooling process influenced by a cooling constant \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the resulting function is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) changes the initial conditions of the temperature distribution by scaling \\\\( u_0 \\\\) with \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\). This modifies the subsequent evolution of the distribution according to the heat equation, leading to different temperature distributions at any time T compared to just evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under the heat equation.",
