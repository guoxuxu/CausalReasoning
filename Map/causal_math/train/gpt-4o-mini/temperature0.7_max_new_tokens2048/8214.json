  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and its integral transformation using a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we uniquely recover the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the Fourier transform's spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the delta function nature of the Fourier transform for \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the peak's location in the spectrum uniquely determines the original function's frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). There's no ambiguity about this frequency.",
