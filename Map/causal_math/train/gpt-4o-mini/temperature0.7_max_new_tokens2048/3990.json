  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We explore the function behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[F](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} F(t) dt \\\\) with respect to the Laplace transform when \\\\( F(t) = f(t) \\\\) for t in the complex plane.\n\nFrom the transformed form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\) provided by the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), can we deduce that the original function was \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) without additional information about the transformation properties?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), and knowing it represents the Laplace transform of a function, one can deduce that the original function was \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), since the inverse transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\) uniquely corresponds to \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) under the properties of the Laplace transformation.",
