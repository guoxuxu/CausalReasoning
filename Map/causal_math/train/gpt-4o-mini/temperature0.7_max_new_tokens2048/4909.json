  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a complex exponential function. This function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is mapped through a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer. We explore the dynamics of this transformation over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to become \\\\( z(0)^n \\\\), and then the output is given by \\\\( z(T) = (e^{iT})^n \\\\) for some \\\\( T > 0 \\\\), will this output match the transformation \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) directly applied at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) and the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) commute since the operation of raising to the power of \\\\( n \\\\) commutes under exponential growth. Thus, \\\\( z(t)^n = (e^{it})^n = e^{int} \\\\) will directly match the calculated \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\).",
