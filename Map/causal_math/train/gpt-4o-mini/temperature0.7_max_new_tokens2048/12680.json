  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its implications over the variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\), and then analyzed for different values of \\\\( s \\\\) without further transformation, will \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) be affected by the value of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), which clearly shows dependence on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\). The outcome of the integral transformation is directly influenced by the complex exponential component introduced by \\\\( a \\\\).",
