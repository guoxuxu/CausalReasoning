  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyse the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was purely evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory by integrating the transformed state over time, which alters the initial conditions and consequently the evolution pathway under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\). The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) affects the initial state's scaling and potential rotation, which isn't corrected or reversed simply through natural evolution under M.",
