  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\\\). This transformation is applied to a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int h(x) K(x, s) dx \\\\). Investigate the effects of the transformations and their reversibility across different conditions.\n\nIf an additional transformation, \\\\( p(x) = x^2 h(x) \\\\), is applied to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) before the integral transformation, is the effect observed in \\\\( g(s) \\\\) purely determined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) irrespective of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation modifies \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to \\\\( p(x) \\\\), which when used in the kernel transformation changes the nature of the output \\\\( g(s) \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is influenced both by the nature of \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) and the quadratic transformation, meaning the outcome is not determined purely by the kernel.",
