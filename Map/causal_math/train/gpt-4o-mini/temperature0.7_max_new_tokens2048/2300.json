  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier Transform scenario where a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) is transformed into its Fourier counterpart \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and affected by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(x) = e^{-a x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the final convoluted function, can we determine the exact sequence and type of interventions (convolutions with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\)) used, solely by examining the output?",
  "Explanation": "The output resulting from consecutive convolutions with Gaussian kernels cannot uniquely determine the sequence of convolutions due to the cumulative and similar effects of Gaussian convolutions on the function. Different sequences of applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could yield statistically close or identical results, hence making it infeasible to precisely backtrack the convolution sequence.",
