  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect the effects on the function when it is subjected to a Fourier transformation, given by \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nFrom the knowledge of \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) \\) alone, can we infer the exact value of \\( \\omega \\) in the original function \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) gives a sharp peak (Dirac delta function) at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\). The location of this peak directly represents the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\) of the sinusoidal function in \\( z(t) \\), thus allowing us to precisely determine \\( \\omega \\) from \\( F(z)(\\xi) \\).",
