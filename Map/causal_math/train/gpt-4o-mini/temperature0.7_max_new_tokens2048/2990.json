  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. We are examining the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) which maps \\( z(t) \\) into the s-domain.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from the Laplace transform \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)} \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are uniquely determined by the location of the pole in the s-domain. Given this Laplace transform, the pole at \\( s = a+bi \\) directly gives the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).",
