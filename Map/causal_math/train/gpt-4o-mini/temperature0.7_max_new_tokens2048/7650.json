  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, acting on the time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). We examine the effect of Fourier Transform on \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and explore how these transformations influence causal relationships.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), but unaware that \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) was applied, can we accurately deduce the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any distortion or loss?",
  "Explanation": "By recognizing the characteristic frequency shift of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the transformed signal's spectrum, one can correctly recover \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by applying an inverse shift in the frequency domain, assuming knowledge of the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The inverse Fourier Transform can then regenerate \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from modified spectrum.",
