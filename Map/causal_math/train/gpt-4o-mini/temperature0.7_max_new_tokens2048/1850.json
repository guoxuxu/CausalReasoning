  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We study the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) being another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nFrom observing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine if the original system evolved naturally from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) had been applied without previous knowledge of the use of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial control (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied or not) purely from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible because different parameters \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and commencements \\\\( t \\\\) of transformation application could lead to similar end states, particularly given the complex exponential nature of the function.",
