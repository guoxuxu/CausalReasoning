  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) which converts the function u(x, t) into its frequency components \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is computed at time t = 0 for an initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) without additional transformation, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) to T and then applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution under the operator L and the Fourier transform commute owing to the linearity and time-invariance of L, assuming \\\\(L\\\\) is a constant-coefficient differential operator. Therefore, evolving first and then transforming gives the same result as transforming first and then evolving.",
