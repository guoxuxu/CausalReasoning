  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system represents a basic integral transformation with a complex exponential kernel. We investigate the influence of a matrix multiplier \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) continues to evolve with the original integral transformation, will the result \\\\( Mz(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) without the application of \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time zero modifies the initial conditions, resulting in a trajectory alteration. The outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( Mz(T) \\\\), is not only scaled but could potentially have its vector orientation changed depending on the properties of \\\\( M \\\\).",
