  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where the function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), with C being a real constant. The evolution of the system is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the differential equation and not on the initial transformation by \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics altering the endpoint, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on the differential equation process but also significantly on the integral transformations previously applied. The interaction between \\\\( e^{-iCs} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCs} \\\\) across different segments would produce compositional changes.",
