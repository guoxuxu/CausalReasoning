  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\). For causal inference, analyze the impacts of altering \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) without and with interventions.\n\nGiven the resulting \\( f(t) \\) that includes a scaled term \\( n \\cdot e^{at} \\), can we deduce the scaling factor \\( n \\) and the presence of \\( e^{at} \\) with certainty by analyzing \\( f(t) \\) only?",
  "Explanation": "If multiple possible interventions or initial conditions could lead to the inclusion and scaling of \\( e^{at} \\) in \\( f(t) \\), it's not possible to uniquely identify the scale factor \\( n \\) or to affirmatively say that \\( e^{at} \\) was added during the intervention without additional information on the original \\( F(s) \\) or the nature of interventions.",
