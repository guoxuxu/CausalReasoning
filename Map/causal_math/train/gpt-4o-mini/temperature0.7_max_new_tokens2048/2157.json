  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf at t = 0, the function \\( z(t) \\) is multiplied by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) and no further transformation is applied, will the resulting Fourier transform change compared to the original \\( z(t) \\) when \\( t \\) approaches infinity?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying the function \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) adds a term that affects the decay rate of the signal in the time domain, which corresponds to a shift and additional broadening in the frequency domain representation, thus fundamentally changing the Fourier transform of the function.",
