  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = C e^{At} \\\\), where A is a skew-symmetric matrix and C is a constant matrix. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transform given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a perturbation matrix \\\\( D \\\\) is added to A, resulting in a new system \\\\( y'(t) = C e^{(A+D)t} \\\\), and then the Laplace transform is applied, will the new transform \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) be unaffected by \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( D \\\\) modifies the system matrix \\\\( A \\\\), thus changing the dynamics represented in the exponent, leading to a different Laplace transform \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) that reflects this change.",
