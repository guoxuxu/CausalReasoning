  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the function V(x), and governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\). We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(x)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\xi x} x(t) dt \\\\) on the trajectory of the particle.\n\nAfter observing the trajectory \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time T, evolved without knowing whether a Fourier transformation was initially applied, can we ascertain the original trajectory \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of an initial Fourier transformation, recovering the original trajectory \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) is ambiguous because the Fourier transform could alter phase and amplitude conditions that are critical for reconstructing the starting position and velocity.",
