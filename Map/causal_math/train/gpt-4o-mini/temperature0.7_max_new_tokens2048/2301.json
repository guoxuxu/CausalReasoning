  "Problem": "Let's consider the vector space transformation by the integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), known as the Laplace Transform. We study the behavior when the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, transforms under this operation.\n\nGiven the transformation \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) at initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), applied directly without modification, does the transform solely depend on the properties of A?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, since \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), the output of the Laplace Transform, \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\), will depend directly on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The Laplace Transform computes the system's response in the s-domain and is purely dependent on how \\\\( A \\\\) defines the excitation function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
