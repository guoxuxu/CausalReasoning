  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(\\ z = h(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\)\\), where x and y are variables modified by a transformation \\(\\ T(u, v) = (e^{Au}v, e^{Bu}v) \\)\\) dependent on parameters A and B.\n\nIf the transformation \\(\\ T(u, v) \\)\\) is applied to variables (u, v) at \\(\\ t = 0 \\)\\), and then \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) is computed without further intervention, will \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) at \\(\\ t = T \\)\\) be equivalent to directly computing \\(\\ h(u, v) \\)\\) without applying transformation \\(\\ T \\)\\) at \\(\\ t = T \\)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\(\\ T \\)\\) changes the initial inputs \\(\\ (x, y) = (e^{Au}v, e^{Bu}v) \\)\\), modifying the output of \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\). The exponential terms \\(\\ e^{Au} \\)\\) and \\(\\ e^{Bu} \\)\\) alter the trajectory of x and y, resulting in a different value of \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) compared to \\(\\ h(u, v) \\)\\).",
