  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^s ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter representing time.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time T, can we determine specifically whether \\\\( z \\\\) was squared at some earlier point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), just by analyzing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at T?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations such as squaring \\\\( z \\\\) purely based on the observation of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a later time is generally infeasible due to the complex interactions in the integral and the exponential decay terms, which mask the effects of earlier transformations.",
