  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system characterized by linear transformations over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We evaluate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) at different times, where M is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T = 1, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The possible application of \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) alters the initial state in a way that cannot be reversed uniquely without additional information regarding the application of M. Different initial conditions could lead to the same observed state at T = 1, particularly if M is non-invertible or not commutative with D.",
