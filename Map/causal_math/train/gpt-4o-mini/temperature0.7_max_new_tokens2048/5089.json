  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a system matrix and B is a control matrix, coupled with a control input u. We analyze the impact of applying a state-dependent transformation \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\( dx/dt = Ax \\\\) without any further input (\\\\( u = 0 \\\\)), will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( dx/dt = Ax \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Cx_0 \\\\). The solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will evolve from this new initial state according to the system dynamics given by A, which in general results in a different state at time T compared to the evolution of the original \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without the transformation.",
