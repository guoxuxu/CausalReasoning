  "Problem": "We consider the Fourier transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\. The system analysis involves altering the input signal using a transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) where a is a constant, and observing the impact on the resulting Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform at t = T, can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( v(t) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the transformed function at T?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the exponential damping functions \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) can result in similar or identical spectral outputs for different configurations of a and b. This ambiguity in resulting transformations makes it impossible to uniquely identify the application sequence or specific values of a and b used during the transformations.",
