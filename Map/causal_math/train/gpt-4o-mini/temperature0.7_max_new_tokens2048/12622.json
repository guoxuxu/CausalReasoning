  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a square matrix. We explore the system's response under the integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where N is another constant matrix and t is a parameter for duration.\n\nIf a corrective linear operation \\\\( U(z) = Pz \\\\) (where P is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on M and not on N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces an additional dynamic influenced by matrix P. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) therefore becomes a function of the original matrix M, the initial transformation matrix N, and the intervention matrix P, influencing how states evolve from the intervention point onward.",
