  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, describing an oscillator in the complex plane. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, applied at different times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the oscillatory behavior without being affected by \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) adds another layer of complexity as it modifies both the phase and magnitude depending on \\\\( b \\\\). The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the exponential factors due to both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), altering both the frequency and amplitude from what would be expected under the oscillator's sole influence.",
