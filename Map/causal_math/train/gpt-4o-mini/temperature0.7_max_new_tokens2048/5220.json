  "Problem": "Consider the transfer function of a linear system represented by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We investigate the system's response to complex inputs and the effect of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing an output that results from a convoluted input transformation with \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we conclusively trace back to the original input waveform?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original waveform from the output after convolution with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is complex, as multiple different inputs might yield the same or a similar convolved response due to properties of convolution and the loss of specific wave characteristics.",
