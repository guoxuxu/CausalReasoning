  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a skew-symmetric matrix. Analyze the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) over time t, where N is another skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be inferred after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to uniquely retrace the path to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The application of \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) impacts the trajectory uniquely depending on N, making deducing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) by just observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) infeasible unless N and M are specially related, such as commutative.",
