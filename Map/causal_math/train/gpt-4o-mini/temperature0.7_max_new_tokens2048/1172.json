  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions describing a physical system. We investigate a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency, applied to this system over time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both), merely from knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intertwining effects of the transformations \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) and \\( e^{i\\theta t} \\), along with the dynamic \\( \\lambda \\), contribute to a range of possible paths that could result in the same endpoint \\( z(T) \\). Disentangling these influences based on the endpoint alone is highly challenging without additional information on the sequence or parameters of applied transformations.",
