  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also define a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant and t represents time.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential growth or decay introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) in the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) complicates direct inference of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), computating back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) would involve ambiguity in the extracted phase and magnitude due to the unknown influence of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
