  "Problem": "Let's consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time in the complex plane. We investigate the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), then let the system evolve according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further changes, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to the evolution without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at the initial time modifies \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from 1 to 1^2=1. However, the nature of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes future values as \\\\( z^2(t) = e^{2it} \\\\), leading to different behavior compared to the unaltered function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which follows the path \\\\( e^{it} \\\\).",
