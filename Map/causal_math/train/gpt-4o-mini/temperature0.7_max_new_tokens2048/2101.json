  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = xe^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. The transformation \\(\\ T : z \\mapsto z^2 \\) is applied to this function.\n\nIf the transformation \\( T \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), leading to \\( T(z(0)) = (xe^{i\\\\omega \\\\times 0})^2 = x^2 \\), and then \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the values of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as directly evolving \\( z(t) = xe^{i\\\\omega t} \\) without applying \\( T \\) at the initial time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T \\) modifies the initial condition and thus the trajectory of the system. Direct evolution without applying \\( T \\) results in \\( xe^{i\\\\omega T} \\), whereas evolving \\( T(z(0)) = x^2 \\) leads to \\( x^2e^{i\\\\omega T} \\), showing a squared magnitude and thus a different trajectory.",
