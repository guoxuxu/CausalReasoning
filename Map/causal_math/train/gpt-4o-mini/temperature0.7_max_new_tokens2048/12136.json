  "Problem": "Consider an integral operation on the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) within the contour integral along a closed curve \\\\( C \\\\. The transformation to be applied is \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) before executing the integral.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and then we compute the contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{iz} z^2 dz \\\\) without further intervention, will this integral have the same value as the original \\\\( \\\\int_C z^2 dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) significantly alters the integrand, changing the function's structure that affects the outcome of the contour integral. The exponential multiple of \\\\( z^2 \\\\) introduces oscillatory behavior which will yield a different result from directly integrating \\\\( z^2 \\\\).",
