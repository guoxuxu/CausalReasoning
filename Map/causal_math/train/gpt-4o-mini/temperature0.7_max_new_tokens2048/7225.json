  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Qi \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We analyze the behavior under a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to the function at t = 0 and is then allowed to evolve according to the differential equation without further intervention, will the spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any future time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if we just considered the original transformation and evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the function into the frequency domain and subsequent evolution according to the differential equation alters the frequency components differently than if the function remained in the time domain. The differential equation will change the phase and amplitude of frequency components, generating a different spectrum.",
