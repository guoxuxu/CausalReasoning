  "Problem": "Consider a system where the evolution of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The impact of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any observed state at time T could result from different initial states, given the potential modification by \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\). The lack of clarity on the presence of this transformation makes tracing back to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) impossible.",
