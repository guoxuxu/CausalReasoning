  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. An integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to study its properties over time \\( t \\).\n\nAfter observing \\( z(T) \\) at time T, can we determine the form or effect of \\( T(z) \\) that was applied previously without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( z(T) \\) alone does not provide any direct information about the transformation \\( T(z) \\) or its effects, as \\( z(T) \\) is not impacted by the transformation but solely by its own evolutionary dynamics \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).",
