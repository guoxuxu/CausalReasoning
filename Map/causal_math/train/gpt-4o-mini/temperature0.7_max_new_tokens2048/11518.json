  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform, which we denote as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) = F(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform output \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), can we precisely trace back to conclude that the original function was definitely \\\\( e^{iwx} \\\\) without other possibilities?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\) suggests a exponential form with a complex frequency, it alone isn't sufficient to uniquely determine that the input was specifically \\\\( e^{iwx} \\\\), as other factors or additional transformations might have been present initially.",
