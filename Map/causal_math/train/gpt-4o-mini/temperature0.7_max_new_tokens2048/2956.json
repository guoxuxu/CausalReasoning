  "Problem": "Consider a complex function analysis where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied to a function in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system's dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), \\\\( h(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from various combinations of transformations and their timings. The complex exponential nature of the transformations allows for multiple trajectories that converge to the same endpoint, obscuring the specific sequence of transformations applied.",
