  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{(\\\\alpha+i\\\\beta)t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are real numbers governing exponential growth and oscillation, respectively.\n\nDoes the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at time t = 0 affect the system's behavior at any later time t = T compared to if initially \\\\(z_0\\\\) evolved purely under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition by scaling and rotating the vector \\\\(z_0\\\\), thereby altering both the magnitude and phase of the system's trajectory. This leads to different behavior at any later time t = T, due to the additional factors of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\).",
