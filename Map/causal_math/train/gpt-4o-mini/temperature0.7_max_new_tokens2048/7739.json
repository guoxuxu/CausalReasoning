  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nIf a different modulation \\\\( k(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) is applied as an intervention after initial modulation and before the Fourier transform, will the outcome in the Fourier domain depend distinctly on both modulations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional modulation \\\\( k(t) \\\\) will further shift the frequency content from \\\\( z(\\\\omega - ia) \\\\) to \\\\( z(\\\\omega - i(a + b)) \\\\). Hence, the outcome distinctly reflects the composite effect of both modulations, revealing the dependency on each.",
