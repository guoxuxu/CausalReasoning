  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are square matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors. The function describes the evolution of two components combined linearly over time and affected by different transformation matrices.\n\nAssuming vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are given at t = 0 without other interventions, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be solely influenced by the initial values \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is determined directly by the expressions \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}y \\\\). Since there is no alteration or intervention in the system, the effect at time T is predictably and solely dependent on the initial conditions using the given transformations.",
