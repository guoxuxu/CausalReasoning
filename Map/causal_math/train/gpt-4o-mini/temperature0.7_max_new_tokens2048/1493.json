  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) represents a transformation over time t, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial state to \\\\( e^{N0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but evolving from this altered state under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) will generally result in a different outcome at t = T because \\\\( e^{(M+N)t} \\\\) is not generally equal to \\\\( e^{Mt}e^{Nt} \\\\) due to non-commutativity of matrix exponentials.",
