  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), on this function and analyzing its impact on the system's dynamics.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified by a scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\), specifically \\\\( k \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\), does this affect the detected frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) modifies the amplitude of the Laplace Transform but does not affect the location of the pole, which determines the frequency component. The frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) remains discernible and unchanged as it still corresponds to the imaginary part of the pole position in the transform domain.",
