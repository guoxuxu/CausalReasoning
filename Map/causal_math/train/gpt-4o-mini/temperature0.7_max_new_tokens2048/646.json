  "Problem": "In a closed-loop control system, the controlled process is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a fixed matrix. An external controller intervenes using a function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) where D is a control matrix and t represents time.\n\nCan the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely inferred from observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T given no knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), any observation of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T is ambiguous concerning the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\). \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\)'s effect on the initial conditions may disguise the true nature of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), especially since D could significantly alter the progression dictated by \\\\( M \\\\).",
