  "Problem": "Explore the relationships in a mathematical model where the periodic function \\\\( x(t) = cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by the integral transform \\\\( L\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the transformed output, can you uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform output depends on both the decay factor \\\\( s \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Without the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\), the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) cannot be isolated since multiple combinations of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could produce similar transform characteristics.",
