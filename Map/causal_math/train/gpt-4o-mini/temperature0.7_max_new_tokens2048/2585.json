  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the function transforms under the operation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(s) ds \\\\), which is integrated over the time interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed for z(t) from t = 0 to T, and the function z(t) is allowed to evolve naturally without intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at later times be the same as the case where no integral transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The computation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from t = 0 to T does not alter the functional form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The function continues to evolve accordingly to its original definition, independent of the integral computed.",
