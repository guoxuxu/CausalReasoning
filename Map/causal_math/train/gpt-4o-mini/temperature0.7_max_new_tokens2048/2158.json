  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nCan the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) be uniquely recovered from its Fourier transform after it has been modified by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) alters the decay properties of the signal, reflected as changes in the frequency spectrum (broadened and shifted). Since Fourier transform of the modified signal does not retain unique inverse properties due to this decay factor, \\( z(t) \\) cannot be accurately recovered.",
