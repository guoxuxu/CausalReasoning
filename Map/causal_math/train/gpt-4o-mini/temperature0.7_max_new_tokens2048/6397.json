  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) with \\( \\lambda > 0 \\), and consider the transformation \\( T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t} \\) applied to \\( u \\).\n\nIf \\( T(u) \\) is applied to \\( u(x, 0) \\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) without further intervention, will \\( T(u)(x, t) \\) at t = T exactly represent \\( u(x, T) \\) under the original dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T(u) \\) modifies the initial state of the system to \\( u(x, 0)e^{-\\lambda 0} = u(x, 0) \\), which still evolves but under the unmodified dynamics. The function \\( T(u) \\) essentially creates an equilibrium state but does not align with the dynamics governed by \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) over time, unless \\( t=0 \\), hence the states will differ for \\( t > 0 \\).",
