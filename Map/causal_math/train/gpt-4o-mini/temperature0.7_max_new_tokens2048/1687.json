  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagation described by the second order partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial t^2 = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) with a perturbation function \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf a new function \\\\(g(u) = u e^{\\\\mu t}\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the wave profile\\\\(u(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the wave equation's constant \\\\(c\\\\) and not by \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an intervention such as \\\\(g(u) = u e^{\\\\mu t}\\\\) introduces additional factors that will alter the wave's evolution. This change depends on both the initial perturbation by \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and the intervention by \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\), each contributing exponentially to the profile's transformation and thus influencing the state of \\\\(u(T)\\\\).",
