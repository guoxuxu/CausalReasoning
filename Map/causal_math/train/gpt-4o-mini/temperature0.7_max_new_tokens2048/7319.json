  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by the eigenfunction expansion \\\\( u(x, t) = \\\\sum_n a_n(t) \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\), where \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) are the time-dependent coefficients and \\\\( \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\) are the eigenfunctions. An operation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is defined as applying a differential operator, specifically \\\\( F(u) = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nIf during the evolution at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( G(u) = u + d \\\\) (where d is a constant) is applied, will the resultant function at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial application of \\\\( F \\\\) and not on \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) adds a constant to the whole function, altering its subsequent evolution. This change affects how the coefficients \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) evolve post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) depends on both the initial effect of \\\\( F \\\\) and the mid-way intervention of \\\\( G \\\\).",
