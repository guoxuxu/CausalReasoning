  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. The transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) with another constant matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) is applied to assess various impacts on the function.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it becomes untraceable to accurately reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{QT} \\\\) can alter the initial conditions significantly. Distinguishing the effects of P and Q from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without prior information on the transformation is fundamentally ambiguous.",
