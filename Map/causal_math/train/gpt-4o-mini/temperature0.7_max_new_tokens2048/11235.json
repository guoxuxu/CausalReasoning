  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and we study its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf we modify \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by multiplying with another exponential function \\\\( e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant, how does it affect the outcome of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\\\( e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) changes the frequency of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\beta \\\\). This frequency shift directly impacts the behavior under the transformation, affecting the integral through the interaction between the frequencies and resulting in a different output.",
