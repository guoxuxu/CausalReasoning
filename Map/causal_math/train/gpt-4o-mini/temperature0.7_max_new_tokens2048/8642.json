  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We evaluate how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any exponential scaling due to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) cannot be disentangled from the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). This makes it indeterminate whether the observed state accumulated changes due to scaling or purely from the rotational dynamics.",
