  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{L}u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a function of both space and time, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on the system and querying causality with and without intervention.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform into \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(0, k)\\\\), and then is evolved according to the differential operator without any further intervention, will the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(t, k)\\\\) at time t obey the transformed version of the partial differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Fourier transform to the initial condition and evolving it under the differential operator behaves predictably, with the transformed system obeying the Fourier-transformed differential equation due to the linearity and time-invariance of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\). The Fourier transform merely changes the domain from spatial to frequency without altering the intrinsic causal relationships ruled by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).",
