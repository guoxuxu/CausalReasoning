  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of the operator \\( L[y] = \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + py \\) on the function \\( y(x) = e^{rx} \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( r \\) are constants. The main focus is on the causal relationship observed when transforming the function through this differential operator and exploring the impact of inserting an arbitrary function \\( h(x) = qx^2 \\) (where \\( q \\) is a constant) into the system.\n\nGiven that the output after using operator \\( L \\) is \\( (r^2 + p)e^{rx} \\), is it possible to exactly reconstruct the original function \\( y(x) = e^{rx} \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since the output carries the form \\( (r^2 + p)e^{rx} \\) which is a scalar multiple of \\( e^{rx} \\), one can directly infer that the original function was \\( e^{rx} \\), given the distinctive exponential behavior.",
