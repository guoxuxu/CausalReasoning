  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = a u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = b v \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants. We apply an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{kt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional operation \\\\( H(z) = z(t) + c \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number) is applied, and we then again apply \\\\( T(z) \\\\) to this new state, will the result depend solely on the initial conditions set by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding \\\\( c \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) directly, affecting the ultimate integral calculated by \\\\( T(z) \\\\). These alterations integrate into the subsequent state and thus \\\\( T(z) \\\\) combines the effect of the original system and the intervention.",

The functions u(t) and v(t) combine to create the complex function z(t). The application of the transformation T(z) to z(t) results in a new state influenced by the initial conditions of u(t) and v(t). The addition of c to z(t) modifies the state to H(z), which then also influences the outcome when T is reapplied, but the final result is still dependent on the initial conditions of u(t) and v(t).",
