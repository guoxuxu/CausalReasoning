  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T: f(x) \\\\mapsto \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The causal relationship of this transformation in signal processing contexts (Laplace Transform) is studied.\n\nCan we revert accurately to the original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) after applying the Laplace Transform and then performing the inverse Laplace Transform without knowing the value of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace Transform can indeed revert \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) back to \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) accurately given that the correct range of \\\\( s \\\\) is chosen making Re(s) greater than \\\\( a \\\\) to ensure convergence, emphasizing the bijectiveness of the Laplace Transform on this class of functions.",
