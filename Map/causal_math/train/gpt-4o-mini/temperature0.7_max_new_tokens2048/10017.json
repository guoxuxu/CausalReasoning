  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, and D as constants. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the system equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) initially modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by introducing a phase shift, which alters both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) over time. This phase alteration can lead to a fundamentally different trajectory for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) when evolved under the given differential equations.",
