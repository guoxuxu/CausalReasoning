  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the input signal and \\\\(e^{i\\omega s}\\\\) is a complex exponential function used for frequency analysis. The transformation aims to filter or modify the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nBased on the observed spectrum of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we uniquely determine both the original frequency of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the intervention frequency \\\\(\\eta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of frequency transformation and superposition in the spectrum, observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)'s spectrum alone does not uniquely determine both frequencies. The observed frequencies could arise from multiple combinations of base and intervention frequencies, resulting in inherent ambiguity without additional information.",
