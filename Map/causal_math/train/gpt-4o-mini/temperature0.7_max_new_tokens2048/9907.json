  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the frequency domain, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then transformed by the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), taking place over a duration T.\n\nIf an additional phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)} \\\\), will the output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) after this intervention be non-zero?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a phase shift changes the properties of the integral. Depending on the value of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), the result of the integral may no longer conform neatly to zero as phase shifts modify the start and end points of the integral, potentially leaving a residual complex vector.",
