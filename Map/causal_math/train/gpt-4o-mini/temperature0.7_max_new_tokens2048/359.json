  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{(z-a)^2} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane encompassing the singularity at \\\\( z = a \\\\). Analyze how the transformation's effect varies due to perturbing the path \\\\( C \\\\) or modifying the exponential term's coefficient.\n\nIf at a certain parameter \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the coefficient of the exponential term changes from \\\\( t \\\\) to a new value \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the outcome of the integral transformation depend only on the new coefficient and not on the previous one?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the coefficient in the exponential term affects the entire function being integrated, thus altering the end result of the integral transformation. The final outcome depends on both the original trajectory (prior coefficient values) as well as the intervention point and new terms, as they reshape the functional form inside the contour integral.",
