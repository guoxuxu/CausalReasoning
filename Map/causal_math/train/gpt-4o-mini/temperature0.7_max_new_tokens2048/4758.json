  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Du \\\\), where D is the Laplacian operator. Analyze the influence of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u](k) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), on the system's behavior over time.\n\nAfter observing the system at time t = T, can you determine the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier Transform was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a Fourier Transform could have modified the initial state in a way that is not recognizable just from observing the state at a later time, especially without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied. The solution's evolution in the frequency domain could differ significantly from its spatial counterpart.",
