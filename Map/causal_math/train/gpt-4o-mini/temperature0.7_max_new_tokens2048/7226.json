  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Qi \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We analyze the behavior under a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 precisely after observing its Fourier transform spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the exact time-evolution dictated by P and Q?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing how P and Q influence the function over time, the original condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T. As changes in amplitude and phase due to P and Q affect the spectrum temporally, the inversion from frequency back to time domain lacks the necessary data on these influences.",
