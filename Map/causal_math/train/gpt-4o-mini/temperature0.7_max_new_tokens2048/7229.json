  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nIf the Laplace transformation is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) without any intervention, does the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) solely depend on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), calculated as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{i \\\\omega t}) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\), depends exclusively on the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\). There are no other variables or parameters involved in this transformation under the given conditions.",
