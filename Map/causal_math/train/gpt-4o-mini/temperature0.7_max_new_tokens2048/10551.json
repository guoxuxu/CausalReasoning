  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation applied is \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a different constant frequency) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original behavior and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z)\\\\) introduces a new rotation depending on \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) from time \\\\(t_1\\\\) onward, which modifies the trajectory started by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will be influenced by both the original rotation rate \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and the intervention \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), complicating the system's overall dynamics.",
