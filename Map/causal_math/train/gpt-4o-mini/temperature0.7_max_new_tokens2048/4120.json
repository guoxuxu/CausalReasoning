  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod evolves according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where k is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of an intervention defined by a change in boundary conditions from \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0\\\\) (a constant temperature) to an impulse response \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0 + \\\\delta(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nGiven the observed temperature distribution at \\\\(x=L, T\\\\), can we determine unequivocally whether an impulse response was applied at \\\\(x=0, t=0\\\\) or if the boundary was held constantly at \\\\(T_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Temperature readings at a single location \\\\(x=L\\\\) without additional context or simultaneous monitoring at other points do not provide sufficient information to definitively ascertain the type of boundary condition applied at \\\\(x=0\\\\). Multiple scenarios could lead to similar temperature distributions at \\\\(x=L\\\\).",
