  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\), represented by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\nIf an additional Fourier operative, represented by a filtering process \\( h(s) \\), is applied to transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\), will the resulting output be fundamentally dependent only on \\( \\omega \\) and not the initial condition \\( z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a filter \\( h(s) \\) adds another layer of transformation, making the filtered output dependent not just on \\( \\omega \\), but also significantly on \\( z_0 \\). The initial conditions and the specific nature of the filter would influence the resultant spectral composition.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition z_0 and the constant omega both influence the function z(t), which in turn affects the Fourier transform of z(t).
