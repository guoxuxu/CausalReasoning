  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) that describes a rotating vector in the complex plane, influenced by the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We examine the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) to observe the behavior over a period \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a specific \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and then allowed to evolve naturally, will the resultant function at time t = T be the same as if no transformation \\\\( T \\\\) but just natural evolution occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) results in an integral of the function over time, which modifies its behavior significantly from natural exponential growth. Instead of rotating about the origin, the transformed function accumulates values, reflecting a growth in magnitude that is distinctively different from the original function.",
