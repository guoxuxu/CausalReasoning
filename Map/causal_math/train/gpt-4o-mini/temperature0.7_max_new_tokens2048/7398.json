  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We are interested in the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) before the system evolves.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be unambiguously reconstructed from the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\widehat{u}(k, T) \\\\) after evolution under the transformed PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation and the diffusion process impact the information in \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of the transformation and diffusion details applied, reconstructing the exact original function from its evolved Fourier transform counterpart involves ambiguities and potential loss of information.",
