  "Problem": "The behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. An operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling factor.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and independent of whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention, introduced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), overlays additional transformations to the existing solution path, further complicating the dependence on the original state and the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The two complex exponential factors, \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), modify the trajectory in a way that is sensitive to the initial conditions and other operations.",
