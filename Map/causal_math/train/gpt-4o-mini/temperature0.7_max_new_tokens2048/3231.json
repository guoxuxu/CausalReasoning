  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) over the domain [0,1], where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined by the integral transformation \\\\( Lf(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(x, s) f(s) ds \\\\) and \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is a kernel function representing a complex interaction.\n\nIf a modulation function \\\\( M(x) = e^{cx} \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant) is applied pre-integration to \\\\( x^2 \\\\), and then transformed by \\\\( L \\\\), will the final output be dependent only on \\\\( L \\\\) but not the modulation \\\\( M(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the modulation function \\\\( M(x) = e^{cx} \\\\) before transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) incorporates the modulation into the transformation process. Because of this pre-application, the output after applying \\\\( L \\\\) is influenced not only by the operation of \\\\( L \\\\) but also significantly by the characteristics of \\\\( M(x) \\\\), therefore depending on both.",
