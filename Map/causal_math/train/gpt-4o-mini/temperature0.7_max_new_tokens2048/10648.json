  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function f(z) where f is an analytic function of the complex variable z. We're examining the effect of two transformations on f: multiplication by e^z, and application of the Fourier Transform denoted as F.\n\nGiven the transformation result of a Fourier Transform applied to an e^z multiplied f(z), and knowing a latter intervention by g(z), can we deduce whether e^z or a different function was used initially on f(z)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of g(z) post Fourier Transform application complicates the identification of the original operational transformation on f(z). Various different starting functions, when subject to these transformations, can yield similar or non-unique end states, making it impossible to definitively discern the specific initial transformation used.",
