  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices, and \\( u(t) \\) is a control function. We explore the impact of a transformation \\( f(x) = Sx \\), where \\( S \\) is a linear invertible matrix applied instantaneously at a certain time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\( x(T) \\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both) by having access only to the state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying precise interventions purely from the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) is not feasible without additional context or data. Given the linearity and potential combinations of how \\( S \\) and \\( D \\) could affect \\( x \\), multiple combinations could lead to the same \\( x(T) \\). This ambiguity prevents unequivocal determination of past interventions based solely on observing \\( x(T) \\).",
