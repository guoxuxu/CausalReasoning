  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a continuous function. The transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) is explored, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing \\\\( H(s) = F(s - a - c) \\\\), can we explicitly determine the individual values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) without knowledge of initial applications?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting expression \\\\( H(s) = F(s - a - c) \\\\) alone does not provide information to uniquely separate or determine the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) independently. The shift in domain is cumulatively seen as \\\\( s - a - c \\\\), and without other constraints or initial conditions, their individual determination isn’t feasible.",
