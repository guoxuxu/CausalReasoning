  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic form described by \\\\( Q(x) = x^T A x \\\\), where A is a symmetric matrix. We analyze the behavior of this form under a linear transformation defined by the matrix T over the vector space.\n\nWill the application of the transformation T to a vector x and then calculating \\\\( Q(x) \\\\) with the original matrix A, result in the same value as calculating \\\\( Q(Tx) \\\\) using the transformed A in the original space?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation T modifies the vector x to Tx and hence, when applying the quadratic form in the transformed space, i.e., \\\\( (Tx)^T A (Tx) \\\\), the outcome is generally different unless T commutes with A in a specific way (such as T being a scalar multiple of the identity matrix).",
