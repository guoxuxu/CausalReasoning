  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system state over time, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. Here, A and B are constant matrices. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately trace back the initial conditions, as the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) might have altered the dynamics in a way that both complexities of A, B, and C matrices do not permit simple back-calculation.",
