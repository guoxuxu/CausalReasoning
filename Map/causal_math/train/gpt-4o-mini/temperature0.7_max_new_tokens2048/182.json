  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) describes an input function to the system. We examine the impact of a transformation \\\\( f(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are also constant matrices.\n\nCan we determine the original input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential modification by \\\\( f(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), without knowledge of if or how the transformation was applied, it is impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). Different transformations could produce the same observed output due to variations in \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\) that lead to similar integrals.",
