  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region where the velocity field is represented by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\\\). We are interested in analyzing the result of applying a rotational transformation described by the function \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on this velocity field over an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nCan the original orientation of the velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\\\) be accurately deduced from observing the flow at time T if the rotational transformation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 but we are unaware of it?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or even the occurrence of the rotation, the original alignment of the velocity field cannot be precisely reconstructed from observations made at time T. Information about the original configuration is lost due to the transformation.",
