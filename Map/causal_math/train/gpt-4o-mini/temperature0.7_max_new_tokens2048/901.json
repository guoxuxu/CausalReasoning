  "Problem": "In a complex analysis scenario, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\), integrating over the variable s. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time t, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency parameter.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is given and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is calculated at time T, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) always represent the integral from 0 to T without any modification?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system follows a specific integral transformation defined by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega s} \\\\), starting from initial condition \\\\( z(0) = 0 \\\\), the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will deterministically be the value of the integral from 0 to T, with no deviations unless intervened upon.",
