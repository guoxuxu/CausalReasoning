  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\), where D is a linear differential operator. Investigate the influence of a transformation characterised by \\\\( h(z) = z^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\) on the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where k is a non-zero scalar and C is a constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = X, can we determine the precise initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The unknown application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces ambiguity in back-calculating to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could significantly alter the original condition, and without this knowledge, it's impossible to accurately trace back.",
