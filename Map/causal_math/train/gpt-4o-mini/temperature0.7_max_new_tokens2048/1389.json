  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable defined as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\). We analyze how applying a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + b \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants) to the input affects the original function.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then compute \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at this transformed point, will the result be the same as directly applying \\\\( f \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation changes the argument of the function \\\\( f \\\\) and thus changes its value. Since \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), applying it after \\\\( h(z) \\\\) results in \\\\( f(h(z_0)) = \\\\frac{1}{az_0 + b} \\\\), which is generally not equal to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z_0} \\\\).",
