  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving an integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. In this context, assume that \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), with A being a real constant. Further assume that the Laplace transform is uniquely invertible.\n\nDoes changing A directly influence the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} \\\\), assuming no external change to the transformation parameter s?",
  "Explanation": "Changing A directly affects \\\\( f(t) \\\\) which is \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), leading to a different form of the function being transformed. Since the Laplace transform is sensitive to variations in the function f(t), a change in A modifies the resulting transform.",
