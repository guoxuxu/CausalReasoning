  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We analyze how this function transforms through the integral \\\\( g(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{As} ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nIf an intervention using a different function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt} dt \\\\) (where B is a different constant matrix) is applied at some time t1 within [0, T], will the final output at T independently reflect only the effects of A, not influenced by B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) changes the overall system dynamics by introducing a new matrix B in the exponential. The final output at T is a result of the compounded effects of both A and B due to their respective transformations encoded through the integral. The cumulative effect can't be attributed to A alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) is generated by the matrix A, which then influences the integral g(t). The output at time T is determined by g(t) influenced by A. Meanwhile, the function h(t) is generated by the matrix B, which also influences an independent output at time T. Thus, the final output at T can reflect the effects of A independently from B.",
