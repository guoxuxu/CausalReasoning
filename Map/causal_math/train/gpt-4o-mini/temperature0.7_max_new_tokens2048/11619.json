  "Problem": "Consider a system under a linear transformation described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( F^{-1}(z) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on characteristics of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform as an intervention reconstructs a time-domain function from its frequency-domain representation. This reconstructed function, while conceptually related to the original, depends on both the characteristics of the original Fourier transform (which affects what frequencies and phases are present) and on M, influencing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
