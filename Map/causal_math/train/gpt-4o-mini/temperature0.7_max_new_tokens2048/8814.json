  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) on a real signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(s) z(t-s) ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we precisely recover the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) (the transformation function) is not feasible. The convolution alters critical information about phasing and magnitude that cannot be uniquely deciphered without precise knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
