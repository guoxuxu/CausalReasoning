  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), a complex exponential where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real parameter representing frequency. We inspect the behavior of this function under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) over domain \\\\( x \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(X) \\\\) after an intervention, can the specific type of intervention (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both) be determined solely from observing \\\\( z(X) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature of interventions (scaling by \\\\( M \\\\), application of \\\\( T \\\\), or both) from the outcome \\\\( z(X) \\\\) is unclear. The transformations can produce overlapping effects, and without additional data about the parameters or the progression of the function across the domain, the source of change remains indiscernible.",
