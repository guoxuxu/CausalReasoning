  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) where z is a complex number. The function is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real-valued square matrix. This function represents an operator acting on z over time, and we examine the effect of applying an integral transformation with a kernel function \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T B z} \\\\), where B is also a real-valued square matrix and w is another complex variable.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) obtained at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether any transformations acted on it through matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) potentially alters \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a complex exponential manner that is dependent on A. Without knowing A, the reverse transformation from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely or accurately determined, as the effects induced by A are unknown or untraceable.",
