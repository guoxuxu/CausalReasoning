  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) where L is a linear operator on a function space, and the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Analyze how the system behaves under the Fourier transform and its inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\( x_0 \\\\), and the resulting function is then evolved under \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as direct evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to t = T under \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and then evolving \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) modifies how the system's state interacts with the operator L, especially since the spectral properties of L can differ in the transform space. The inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) of the evolved state will generally not match the direct evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) over time T.",
