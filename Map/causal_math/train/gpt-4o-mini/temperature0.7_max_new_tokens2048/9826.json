  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\). For causal inference, analyze the impacts of altering \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) without and with interventions.\n\nCan one uniquely determine whether an exponential term \\( e^{at} \\) was present in the original function \\( f(t) \\) after seeing the modified function \\( f(t) + e^{at} \\) for \\( t > 0 \\), if the process of modification is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the process of modification, it is impossible to ascertain whether the term \\( e^{at} \\) was present in the original function \\( f(t) \\) or was introduced due to the modification in its Laplace Transform. Multiple reasons (e.g., original presence or alteration) could lead to the observed end state.",
