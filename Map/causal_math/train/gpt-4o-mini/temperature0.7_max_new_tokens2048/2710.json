  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\). Consider applying the transformation by \\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf observing \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T \\), can the original vector \\( x_0 \\) be deduced without knowing whether \\( h(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the transformation \\( h(z) \\), it’s ambiguous whether the observed \\( z(T) \\) comes from \\( e^{AT}x_0 \\) or \\( e^{BT}e^{AT}x_0 \\). The lack of information about \\( B \\) and the non-trivial interaction between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) make retracing to \\( x_0 \\) uncertain.",
