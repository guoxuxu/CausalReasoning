  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant, under various conditions where the function is transformed by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time t.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) = z_0^2 e^{iwT} \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's indeterminable if the observed end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) arose from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\). There are multiple complexities that result in the same exponentiated output due to the ambiguity whether \\\\( z(T) \\\\) corresponds to \\\\( z_0 e^{iwT} \\\\) or \\\\( (z_0^2) e^{iwT} \\\\).",
