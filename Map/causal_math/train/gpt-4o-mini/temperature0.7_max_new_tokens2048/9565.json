  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We will study the changes in the function with respect to the integration operator over time defined as \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), and analyze the influence of modifications by derivative with respect to time.\n\nIf we evaluate \\\\( F(t) \\\\) from time 0 to T without any additional transformation or intervention on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will \\\\( F(T) \\\\) be the same as that obtained from direct integration using the original function formula for z(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Direct integration of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) from 0 to T yields \\\\( F(T) = \\\\int_0^T e^{i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\), and performing this operation without modifying z(t) will result in the calculated value, as no transformation is applied to alter the function.",
