  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex system modeled by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. The transformation considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the observed value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), or the specifics of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), there might be multiple possible initial values corresponding to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation modifies both magnitude and phase, which obscures the evaluation of the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",
