  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt \\\\), which is a Laplace transform of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Explore how modifying the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) affects the transform, and consider the impacts of two types of modifications: multiplication by a scalar function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and addition of another function \\\\( w(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( u_y(z) \\\\) derived from \\\\( y(t) = x(t) + w(t) \\\\), and if we only know the transform \\\\( u_x(z) \\\\), can the function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) be uniquely identified?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and invertibility of the Laplace transform for addition, knowing \\\\( u_y(z) \\\\) and \\\\( u_x(z) \\\\) allows for the unique determination of \\\\( u_w(z) \\\\) by subtraction. Since the inverse Laplace transform is unique, this means \\\\( w(t) \\\\) can be uniquely identified, given that the transforms are properly defined and invertible.",
