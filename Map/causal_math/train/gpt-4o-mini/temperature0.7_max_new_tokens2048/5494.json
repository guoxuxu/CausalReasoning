  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential V(x), described by \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = [-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 + V(x)]\\\\psi \\\\). We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) at time t and analyzing its momentum space representation.\n\nGiven the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(p, T) \\\\) in momentum space at t = T, is it possible to determine if \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) was first Fourier transformed or if the system was evolved in position space and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution under the Schrödinger equation, whether in position or momentum space, fundamentally changes the wave function due to non-commuting operators involved in the evolution. Knowing \\\\( \\\\psi(p, T) \\\\) alone does not reveal the specific order of transformation and evolution.",
