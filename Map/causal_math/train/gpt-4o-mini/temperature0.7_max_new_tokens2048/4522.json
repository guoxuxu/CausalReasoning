  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the function u, and then evolving it under a transformed operator \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the original frequency-domain operations (whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied), determining \\\\( u_0 \\\\) only from \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is fundamentally ambiguous. The transformation can modify the frequency components of u, making recovery of u_0 uncertain.",
