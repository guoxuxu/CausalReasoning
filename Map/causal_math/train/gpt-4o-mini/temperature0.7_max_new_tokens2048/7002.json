  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time t, is it possible to infer the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), which modifies the trajectory due to the complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), the original initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the final observation alone.",
