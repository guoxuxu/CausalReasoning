  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform of a given function \\( p(x) \\) defined as \\( q(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) e^{-tx} dx \\), known in mathematics as the Laplace transform in specific settings. This scenario involves comparing the original function \\( p(x) \\) and its transformation, \\( q(t) \\), and understanding the implications of transformations and their inverses on inference without and with interventions.\n\nGiven \\( s(t) \\) (transform of \\( p(x) + r(x) \\)), can we determine which function or functions were added as interventions (like \\( r(x) \\)) by only analyzing \\( s(t) \\) and \\( q(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exactly what interventions were applied (like \\( r(x) \\)) just by analyzing \\( s(t) \\) and \\( q(t) \\) is complicated due to integral transforms potentially mapping different functions to similar or identical transform results, unless additional constraints on \\( r(x) \\) are known.",
