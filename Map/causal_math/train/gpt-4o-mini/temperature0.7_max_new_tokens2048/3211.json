  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. A transformation involving a complex function \\\\(f(z) = Re(z^2)\\\\), where \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), is applied, influencing the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) where the boundary conditions are modified by another complex function \\\\(g(z) = Im(z^3)\\\\), will the final potential \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) be solely dependent on the initial boundaries set by \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new influence on the potential via the function \\\\(g(z)\\\\), significantly impacting how \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) evolves. Both \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) shape the final state, making it dependent on the sequence of these modifications.",
