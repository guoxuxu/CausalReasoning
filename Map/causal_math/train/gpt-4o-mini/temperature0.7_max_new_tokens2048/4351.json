  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) on the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real, positive constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The impact of transforming the system using \\\\( z(t) x(t) \\\\) is studied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( w(t) = e^{i \\\\gamma t} \\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention on the system, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be dependent only on \\\\( -\\\\lambda \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( w(t) \\\\) introduces additional phase shifts and potentially alters the magnitude based on \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), making the final state of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) as well as \\\\( -\\\\lambda \\\\). The system's trajectory can significantly change due to these composite effects.",
