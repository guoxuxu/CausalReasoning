  "Problem": "Consider a control system in which an input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\) influences the output \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate the change induced by a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) where C and D are also constant matrices.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( j(x) = Fe^{Gt}x \\\\) (where F and G are constant matrices) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and B, not on C, D, F, or G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(x) \\\\) adds additional dynamics to the system. Therefore, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on A, B as well as the effects introduced by C, D, F, and G. The overlap in transformations makes the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) a function of all these matrices.",
