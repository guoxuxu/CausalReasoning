  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{mt} \\\\\\) where \\\\( m \\\\) is a complex number, evolving in a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a real constant. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{nt}z \\\\), applied at different times, where \\\\( n \\\\) is another complex number.\n\nIf function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be different at time T as compared to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation modifies the starting condition of the differential equation. Since \\\\( e^{nt} \\\\) affects the scale and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it changes the trajectory, resulting in a different solution at time T compared to the unmodified case.",
