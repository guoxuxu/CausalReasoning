  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-zt} dz \\\\). Let \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real positive parameter.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 e^z \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) still depend solely on the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( z^2 \\\\) modifies the function from which the integral is computed. The quadratically scaled variable \\\\( z^2 \\\\) additionally alters the integral's convergence behavior and thus affects \\\\( y(t) \\\\), making the outcome dependent on both the original and the transformed function.",
