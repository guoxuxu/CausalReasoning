  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i \\\\theta}z\\\\) acts on a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) in the complex plane. Here, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a real number representing a rotation angle. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\) for dynamics given by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant, is considered.\n\nIf at \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(z) = e^{i \\\\phi}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is another rotation angle) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is affected by both rotations, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), in addition to the dynamical evolution due to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). The interventions modify the trajectory by adding rotations, which influences the final position on the complex plane.",
