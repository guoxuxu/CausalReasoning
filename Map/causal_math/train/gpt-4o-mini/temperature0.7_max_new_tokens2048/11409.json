  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. We introduce a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that takes the form \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a finite time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) initially at t = 0 and then evolved over time up to \\\\( T \\\\), will \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\) be identical to applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly on \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) up to \\\\( T \\\\) without first evaluating \\\\( L(z)(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) when applied initially or at any subsequent time up to \\\\( T \\\\) essentially computes the same integral over the interval from 0 to \\\\( T \\\\). This is because \\\\( L \\\\) acts linearly and time-invariantly across the entire range specified, thus yielding the same result regardless of when it's computed.",
