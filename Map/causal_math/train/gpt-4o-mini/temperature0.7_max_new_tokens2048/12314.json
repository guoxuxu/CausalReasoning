  "Problem": "Consider the impact of varying the counterpart of a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant real number, on the integral transform \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\\\). We investigate how changes in \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) affect the outcome of the Fourier transform of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nIf during observation a linear phase shift \\\\\\( \\\\phi(t) = \\\\alpha t \\\\\\) where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a constant, is applied at time \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\), will the analysis of \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) for \\\\\\( t > t_1 \\\\\\) only depend on the original \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) value without considering \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\\\) introduces additional phase variation, affecting the Fourier transform output. Both \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\)'s values determine the new \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\)'s characteristics post-\\\\\\(_t1\\\\\\), as they influence the resultant frequency and phase attributes of the complex exponentials in the Fourier domain.",
