  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and u is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ft}x(t) dt \\\\), where F is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) over the time interval [0, T], can the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined without knowledge of the control input \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) integrates state behavior which is dependent on \\\\( u \\\\). Various control inputs can potentially yield the same integrated outcome, thus making it impossible to reverse-engineer \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without specific knowledge of \\\\( u \\\\).",
