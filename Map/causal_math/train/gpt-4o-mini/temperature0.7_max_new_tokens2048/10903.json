  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex number. We are exploring how the function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) impacts z over time t, where Q is another complex number.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another complex number) is applied as an intervention at a certain time t_1, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The use of additional transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention at time t_1 means that multiple exponential factors (related to Q and R) will affect the trajectory and the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent on all parameters P, Q, and R.",
