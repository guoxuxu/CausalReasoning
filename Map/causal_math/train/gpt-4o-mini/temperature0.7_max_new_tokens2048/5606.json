  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform, which transforms the function into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we infer the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "The structure of the Laplace transform output \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) explicitly includes the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as part of its expression. This direct representation allows for unambiguous deduction of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
