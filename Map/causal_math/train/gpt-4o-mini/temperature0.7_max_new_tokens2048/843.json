  "Problem": "Consider a continuous time system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(s)y(s) ds \\\\), with \\\\( K(s) \\\\) and \\\\( y(s) \\\\) representing kernel and input functions, respectively. We investigate the effect of an input transformation \\\\( y'(s) = y(s) + h(s) \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is another function, on the output over time.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where the input function is reset to \\\\( y''(s) = y(s) \\\\) (removing any effects of \\\\( h(s) \\\\)), will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( y(s) \\\\) and not on the earlier presence of \\\\( h(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of \\\\( h(s) \\\\) up to time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) would already have been integrated into the output \\\\( z(t_1) \\\\), and this historical contribution cannot be annulled by resetting the input function. Therefore, the output at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still retains dependence on the earlier influence of \\\\( h(s) \\\\).",
