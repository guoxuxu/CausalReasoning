  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod is guided by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. The rod's initial temperature profile is altered by a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) represents a specific heat profile added along the rod.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention applies a new temperature distribution \\\\( f(u) = u + q(x) \\\\) (where q(x) represents another heat profile), will the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on k and not on \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or \\\\( q(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( f(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another modifying factor to the system, making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( q(x) \\\\), as well as the diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\). The transformations by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) contribute to the evolution of the temperature profile and affect the outcome at time T.",
