  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We study the effect of this transformation on the integral paths in the complex plane, specifically focusing on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) represents a path in the complex plane.\n\nIf an affine transformation \\\\( g(z) = bz + c \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are complex constants) is applied to each point on path \\\\( C \\\\) to get a new path \\\\( C' \\\\), will the transformed integral \\\\( \\\\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\\\) be independent of the parameters \\\\( a, b, \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation introduces additional dependence on parameters \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) due to the change in functional form and path. The integral will be affected by both the new path and the modified function, resulting in a dependency on these parameters.",
