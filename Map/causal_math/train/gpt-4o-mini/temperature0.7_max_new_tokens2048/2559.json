  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in a complex plane, described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. We introduce a transformation given by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, affecting the amplitude and phase of \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a new mapping \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions using \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) significantly influence the trajectory and the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Each of the transformations associated with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) affects the amplitude and phase of the trajectory, leading to a dependency on both in addition to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(t) evolves over time t under the influence of the angular frequency ω, which drives the change in z(t). The transformation f(z) affects the amplitude and phase of z, while the intervention g(z) also modifies z. However, the future state z(T) for T > t1 primarily depends on the angular frequency ω, rather than the specific transformations defined by α or β.",
