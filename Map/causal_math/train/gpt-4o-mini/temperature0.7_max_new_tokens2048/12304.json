  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), representing a rotation in the complex plane, with A being a real constant. We explore how the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\), where B is another real constant, affects this system over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) until time T, will the result be equivalent to directly using the initial system without applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) introduces an additional rotation by \\\\(e^{iBt}\\\\) at t = 0, which changes the starting point in the complex plane before the evolution under \\\\(e^{iAt}\\\\). This altered starting point generally results in a different endpoint at time T.",
