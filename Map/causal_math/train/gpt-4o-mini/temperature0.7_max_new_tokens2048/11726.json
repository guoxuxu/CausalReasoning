  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variable t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x \\\\). We examine modifications introduced by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be precisely deduced at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, and since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could have rotated the initial point, the observed result at t = T could correspond to multiple possible initial points \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The rotation introduced makes it impossible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",
