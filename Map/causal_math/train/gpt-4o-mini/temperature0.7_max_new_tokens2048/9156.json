  "Problem": "In a control system, the effect of a matrix operator \\\\( P \\\\) on a signal's Fourier transform is examined. Given a signal function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), its Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is denoted by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The operator \\\\( P \\\\) acts on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) to produce \\\\( P(X(\\\\omega)) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\omega^2}X(\\\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final output, can we conclusively determine the sequence of applications of \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) simply by examining the output after running through \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) potentially overlap and the composite transformation through \\\\( G(s) \\\\) can yield equivalent outputs for different sequences of applying \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\). Hence, it is not possible to uniquely identify the sequence of interventions just from the output.",
