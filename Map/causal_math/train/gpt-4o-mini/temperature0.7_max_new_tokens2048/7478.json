  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + k^2 u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x)dx\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and its alteration after a transformation defined by \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( v(x) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\(a\\\\), it is not possible to determine the contribution of the \\\\(ax\\\\) term to the observed \\\\(v(x)\\\\). Hence, one cannot uniquely deduce \\\\(u(x)\\\\) from \\\\(v(x)\\\\) because multiple combinations of \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) could result in the same \\\\(v(x)\\\\).",
