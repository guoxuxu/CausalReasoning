  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial function Z(t) described by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA} ds \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( Z(0) \\\\) from observing \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) at time T if the function z(t) was not known to have been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the function's effect, such as phase rotation, could lead to multiple potential original states \\\\( Z(0) \\\\) due to the complex interplay between the function's frequency and the integral operator.",
