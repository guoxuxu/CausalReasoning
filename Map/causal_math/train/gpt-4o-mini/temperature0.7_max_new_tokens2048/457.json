  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), and consider its Laplace transform, which gives a function in the complex plane. Assume that this function represents the transfer function of a control system, where a and b are constants.\n\nIf the input to the control system changes in a defined way without any external intervention, will the output exactly represent the inverse Laplace transform of the product of the Laplace transform of the input and \\\\( z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, in the absence of external intervention, the output of the system is the convolution in the time domain of the input with the impulse response of the system, which is by definition the inverse Laplace transform of the product of the Laplace transform of the input and the system's transfer function \\\\( z(s) \\\\).",
