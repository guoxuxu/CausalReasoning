  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ x(t) \\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its response to the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) expressed by \\\\( U(s) \\\\). The system’s impulse response is \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ h(t) \\\\} \\\\), relating the input and output through \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is specified without any modifications and the system is allowed to respond naturally, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solely depend on the initial form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( U(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a linear system is entirely determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the system's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), represented in the Laplace domain by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\). Any initial form of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) uniquely specifies the output without further modifications, following linear system theory.",
