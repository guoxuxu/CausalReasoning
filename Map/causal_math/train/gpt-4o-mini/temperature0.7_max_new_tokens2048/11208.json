  "Problem": "In a complex analysis setting, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and t represents time. The impact of the integral transformation defined by a convolution integral \\\\( g(t) = (h * z)(t) \\\\) over time t, with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another function, is analyzed.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time T, can we decisively infer which convolution kernel (either \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\), or both) was applied at earlier times based only on the observed output?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) can lead to similar or identical outputs at time T. Without additional constraints or information, the effect \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at T cannot solely reveal which specific convolutions were applied, due to their potentially overlapping influences.",
