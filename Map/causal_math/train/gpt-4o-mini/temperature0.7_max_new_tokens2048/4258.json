  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex function z(t). The functions are related through the Laplace Transform: \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we retrieve the original forms of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) \\\\) by observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at any time t and applying the inverse operations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the Laplace Transform, observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) allows us to apply Laplace Transform to obtain \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) \\\\). The Laplace Transform is uniquely reversible, assuming the necessary conditions for existence are satisfied, hence we can precisely trace back to the original transforms.",
