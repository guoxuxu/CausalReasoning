  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sw}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a function and \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x(s)e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is multiplied by \\\\( e^{as} \\\\) from s = 0 onward, and then applied to the integral transformation without any further changes, will this affect the resulting function \\\\( z(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( x(s) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{as} \\\\) transforms the original function into \\\\( g(x(s)) = x(s)e^{as} \\\\). This results in the integral transformation \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sw} g(x(s)) ds = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sw}x(s)e^{as} ds \\\\), changing the parameter of integration from \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w-a \\\\), thus altering \\\\( z(w) \\\\).",
