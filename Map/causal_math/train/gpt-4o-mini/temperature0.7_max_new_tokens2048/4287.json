  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of the Laplace transform on this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function is altered to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\delta t}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\delta \\\\) is a real constant, and the Laplace transform is recalculated, will the new transform be solely dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\delta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to a product of two exponentials, yielding \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i(\\omega+\\delta) t} \\\\). The new Laplace transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) becomes \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i(\\omega+\\delta)} \\\\). Hence, the outcome depends both on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( \\delta \\\\).",
