  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the effect of two linear transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = az \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = bz \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are non-zero complex constants, on the mapping described by \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the input complex number \\\\( z \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( T_1 \\\\) or \\\\( T_2 \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( T_1 \\\\) and \\\\( T_2 \\\\) could scale \\\\( z \\\\) differently, leading to multiple potential original inputs that could yield the same output under \\\\( f \\\\). Without knowing the exact transformation, one cannot uniquely determine the original \\\\( z \\\\).",
