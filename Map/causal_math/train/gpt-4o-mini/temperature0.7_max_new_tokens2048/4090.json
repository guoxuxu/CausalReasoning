  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az + B\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven only the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we retroactively determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing if \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\(T(z)\\\\), there are infinitely many possibilities for \\\\(z_0\\\\) based on different potential choices of \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). The transformation \\\\(Az + B\\\\) could have configured any number of initial states to reach the same \\\\(z(T)\\\\), especially given the non-invertibility when \\\\(A = 0\\\\).",
