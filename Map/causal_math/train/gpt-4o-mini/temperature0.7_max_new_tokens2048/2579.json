  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered over time t, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf we apply an intervention \\\\( q(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) given that the system continues to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is affected by both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) from the initial transformation and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) from the intervention due to cumulative scaling effects that alter the magnitude of \\\\( z \\\\) over time, in addition to the rotational dynamic imparted by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
