  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), with M being a linear operator. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), applied to the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\), transforming it into the s-domain.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}\\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace-transformed state \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at any given s match the transformation of the trajectory evolved directly from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolving under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) results in \\\\( X(s) = (sI - M)^{-1}x_0 \\\\). This relation holds whether the trajectory is transformed initially or after evolving; the evolution of the state variables under \\\\( M \\\\) and the linearity of the system preserve the relationship.",
