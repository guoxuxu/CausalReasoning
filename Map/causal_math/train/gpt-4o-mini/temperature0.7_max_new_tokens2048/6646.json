  "Problem": "Investigate the interplay between two functions, \\\\( p(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\) and \\\\( q(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, and their effects within the integral transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed outcome \\\\( I[p(z)] \\\\), can we infer the exact form of \\\\( p(z) \\\\) used, if it was applied before the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] \\\\) might significantly modify certain characteristics of \\\\( p(z) \\\\), and multiple functions could yield similar outcomes under this transformation. Thus, reconstructing \\\\( p(z) \\\\) from \\\\( I[p(z)] \\\\) is not straightforward without additional constraints or information.",
