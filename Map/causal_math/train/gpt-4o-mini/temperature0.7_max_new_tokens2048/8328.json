  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\. The function undergoes a Fourier transform, yielding the function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nGiven the resulting spectrum \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\), can we determine exactly which frequencies were present initially and which were added as interventions based only on observing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) may show multiple peaks corresponding to different frequencies, but it cannot specify which frequencies were part of the original signal and which were introduced later. Further, phase and amplitude information that could distinguish between original and intervention frequencies is not retrievable solely from the magnitude of the spectrum.",
