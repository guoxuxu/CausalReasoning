  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and \\( z \\) is subjected to the integral transformation \\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex variable \\( s \\). Analyze the effects of modifying \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\) separately on \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\( v(t) \\) by adding a constant value, will this intervention have an effect on the real part of \\( Z(s) \\) at any \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention on \\( v(t) \\) alters only the imaginary part of \\( z(t) \\) and consequently affects only the imaginary part of \\( Z(s) \\). The real part of \\( Z(s) \\), dependent solely on \\( u(t) \\), remains unaffected by changes in \\( v(t) \\).",
