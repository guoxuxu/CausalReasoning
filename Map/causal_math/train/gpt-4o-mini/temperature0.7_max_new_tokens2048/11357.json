  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant. Let's focus on its behavior under the mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing an angular frequency, and t represents time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initialized at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and subjected to time evolution under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) at some later time T be the same as \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) changes the input to the function \\\\( g \\\\) over time, because it rotates the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Therefore, the output at time T, \\\\( g(e^{i\\omega T}z_0) \\\\), generally will not equal \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\), as the function involves a non-linear transformation.",
