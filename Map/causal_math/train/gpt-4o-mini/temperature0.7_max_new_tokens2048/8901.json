  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, complex matrix, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We analyze how the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a constant matrix, changes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) for \\\\( t > 0 \\\\) without further application of \\\\( f \\\\), will the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( f \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) is simply the zero vector (due to the integral of zero), the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remains unaltered. Therefore, it follows the prescribed exponential map \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\), resulting in the same state at any \\\\( t = T \\\\) as if the transformation was never applied.",
