  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant. Let's focus on its behavior under the mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing an angular frequency, and t represents time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z' = e^{-i\\omega t}z \\\\), will the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be solely determined by the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without dependency on the initial conditions or the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affects the trajectory by applying an inverse rotation, and thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the original trajectory and the modification at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The output depends on the initial condition, the function \\\\( g \\\\), and changes introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
