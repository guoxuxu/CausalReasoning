  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the equation \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where x and y are real variables, and i is the imaginary unit. This system is subjected to the transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of the system is analyzed in a scenario where transformations are applied and the system evolves over time.\n\nIf \\\\( G(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) initially, and then we observe the outcome without any further intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the transformation dictated by K?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\) applied initially determines the state of the system directly through the equation without any other external influences altering its evolution, reflecting a direct dependency on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and K.",
