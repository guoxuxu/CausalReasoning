  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex-valued differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau}z d\\\\tau \\\\) over time t, where B is a real constant matrix that generally does not commute with A.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both transformations were applied at any time during evolution purely from this endpoint information?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple pathways involving various combinations of transformations caused by B and C can yield the same end state due to the overlapping influences and possible commutation properties of matrix exponentials, thus leaving ambiguities in the deduction of the exact interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
