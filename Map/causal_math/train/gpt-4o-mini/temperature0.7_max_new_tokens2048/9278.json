  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} z(0) \\\\), where A is a constant real number representing the angular frequency. This transformation is an example of a complex rotation in the time domain.\n\nGiven the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and the value of A, assuming no interventions were made?",
  "Explanation": "While we can recover the magnitude of the initial vector and the difference in angle due to the rotation by \\\\( A \\\\times T \\\\), multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and the initial argument could lead to the same resultant vector at time T due to the periodicity of rotations in the complex plane (every \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\)).",
