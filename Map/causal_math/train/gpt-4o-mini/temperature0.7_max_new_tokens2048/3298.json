  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function is evaluated and then transformed using the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). The system's behavior over the complex plane is considered under this transformation.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed output, can we precisely infer the original function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) in its entirety without knowing \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exact matrix \\\\( A \\\\) influences the specific form and behavior of the exponential in the function. The Fourier transform's output alone, without explicit knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\), does not allow for the precise reconstruction of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) across the complex plane, as multiple matrices could potentially yield similar transformations.",
