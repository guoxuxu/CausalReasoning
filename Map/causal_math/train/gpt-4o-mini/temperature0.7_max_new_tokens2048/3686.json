  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), showing simple harmonic motion in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. Let's investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\) applied to z(t).\n\nGiven the output from the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time t, can we precisely infer the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional data or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) summarized the function over an interval, damping certain frequency components and enhancing others, thus obscuring specific details like exact frequency. Without further data specifying transformations or original settings, the precise frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
