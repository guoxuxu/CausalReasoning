  "Problem": "Consider a set of functions defined by complex mappings \\\\( z = f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) where w is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit. The system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(w(t)) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) = g + ht \\\\) where g and h are complex constants.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the original constant \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) applies a complex exponential function to the initial conditions, complicating reversion since multiple values for \\\\( w \\\\) can map to the same point in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the exponential function.",
