  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = Nz \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another complex constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by all mentioned variables (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), and \\\\( N \\\\)). The new intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the trajectory in a compound manner with the existing dynamics and the preceding transformation \\\\( M \\\\).",
