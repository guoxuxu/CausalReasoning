  "Problem": "Examine a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) with an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\), where L represents a linear differential operator. We consider the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition.\n\nDoes transforming the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0(x)) \\\\) and then evolving according to the PDE change the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t compared to evolving \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition changes the representation of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) into frequency space, thereby modifying how the differential operator L acts on it through its differential properties. This can lead to a different solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) compared to the direct evolution of the untransformed initial condition.",
