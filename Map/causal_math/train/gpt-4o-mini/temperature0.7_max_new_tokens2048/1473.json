  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at time t, transforming the system's state.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) squares the initial state, significantly altering the trajectory of the system. When squaring the state, the trajectory evolves from a new initial state \\\\( z^2_0 \\\\) under the dynamics defined by \\\\( A \\\\), leading to a state at time T that differs from that of an unsquared \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
