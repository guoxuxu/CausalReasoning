  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x \\) a constant vector in complex space. The function transforms \\( z(t) \\) using an operator \\( T \\) defined as \\( Tz = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another constant matrix and \\( T \\) is a fixed terminal time.\n\nIf the function \\( z(t) \\) operates on the vector \\( x \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and evolves according to the transformation \\( T \\) until \\( t = T \\) without further intervention, will the resultant \\( Tz \\) be equivalent to directly applying \\( \\int_0^T e^{(A+B)t}x \\, dt \\) on \\( x \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity of the integral and exponential functions, \\( Tz \\) computed as \\( \\int_0^T e^{Bt}e^{At}x \\, dt \\) simplifies to \\( \\int_0^T e^{(A+B)t}x \\, dt \\). Thus, the direct application of this combined exponential to \\( x \\) yields the equivalent result.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix A transforms the vector x into the function z(t). The initial value of the vector x influences the value of z at time t = 0. The function z(t) is then transformed by the operator T, which integrates the effect of the matrix B applied to z(t). The combined effect of matrices A and B results in the expression e^{(A+B)t}, which influences the integral of x over the interval from 0 to T.",
