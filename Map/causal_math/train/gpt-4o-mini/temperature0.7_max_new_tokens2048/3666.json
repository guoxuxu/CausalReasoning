  "Problem": "We are studying a complex function \\\\( z = f(x+iy) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( f \\\\) is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = z + B \\\\) (with B as a constant complex matrix) affect the output of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nGiven the position of \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) at some later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we determine the specific initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether transformation \\\\( g \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to determine if the output at \\\\( t \\\\) originated from the transformed input \\\\( z_0 + B \\\\) or the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The influence of \\\\( B \\\\) might have permanently altered the path of \\\\( f \\\\).",
