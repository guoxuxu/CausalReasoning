  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) \\) evolving over time according to \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\) applied at different time points.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after only observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( f(z) \\), it's not possible to uniquely recover \\( z_0 \\) since the phase added by \\( e^{it} \\) at the onset could be indistinguishable from natural evolution under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\). The evolved state \\( z(T) \\) might represent multiple potential initial states depending on whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied.",
