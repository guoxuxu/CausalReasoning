  "Problem": "Consider the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed over time interval [0, T].\n\nAfter observing the result of the integral transformation at time T, is it possible to reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further information?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral transformation combines all values of the original function in a specific way, resulting in a loss of information about individual points \\\\( z(t) \\\\) except at certain critical points. Recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the integral alone generally requires additional conditions or information.",
