  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + k^2 u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( U(k) \\\\).\n\nIf a modification is applied to the PDE by changing the constant \\\\( k \\\\) to a new constant \\\\( m \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( U(k) \\\\) only depend on the original \\\\( k \\\\) ignoring the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( m \\\\) alters the wave number in the PDE, modifying its spatial characteristics. This significant intervention affects \\\\( U(k) \\\\), such that the resulting transformed function will depend on both the old and new values of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\).",
