  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is used to transform an initial condition in a spatial eigenfunction problem governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -Au + iBu \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's behavior at time \\\\( T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) be independent of the original constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) partway through evolution introduces a new dynamic that depends both on the initial segment of evolution (influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)) and the latter part governed by \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\). Hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) is a result of both segments of the dynamics.",
