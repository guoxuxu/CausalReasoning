  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by the eigenfunction expansion \\\\( u(x, t) = \\\\sum_n a_n(t) \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\), where \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) are the time-dependent coefficients and \\\\( \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\) are the eigenfunctions. An operation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is defined as applying a differential operator, specifically \\\\( F(u) = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be accurately deduced from the observed \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) assuming no knowledge of whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied, the transformation due to the differential operator could establish fundamentally different initial conditions (\\\\( a_n(0) \\\\)). Thus, determining the exact original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) would be ambiguous due to potential modifications in the eigen-coefficients.",
