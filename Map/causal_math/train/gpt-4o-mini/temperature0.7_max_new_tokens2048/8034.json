  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. The Laplace transform of the function, defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} + i\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the function in the s-domain. We further apply an integral transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was applied, one cannot uniquely deduce \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) due to the potential alterations made by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Multiple different initial functions could yield the same \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) under different transformations.",
