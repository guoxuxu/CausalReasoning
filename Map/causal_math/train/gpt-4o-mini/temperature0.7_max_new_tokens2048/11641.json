  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing position in 2D space over time t. Transformations are applied via \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and subsequently allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T compare identically to the trajectory of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved without the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) alters the initial condition, affecting the trajectory uniquely. The exponential growth factor changes both magnitude and direction depending on \\\\( A \\\\), hence leading to a different trajectory from what would result from evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under natural dynamics alone.",
