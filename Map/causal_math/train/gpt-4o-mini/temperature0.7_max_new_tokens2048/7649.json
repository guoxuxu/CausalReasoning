  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, acting on the time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). We examine the effect of Fourier Transform on \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and explore how these transformations influence causal relationships.\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed via \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at initial time t = 0, subsequently allowing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to undergo Fourier Transform, will the frequency domain representation of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) show a shift by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) units?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a frequency modulation. Consequently, when \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is subjected to Fourier Transform, the frequency spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is shifted by \\\\( \\omega \\\\). This shift is a fundamental property of frequency modulation in signal processing.",
