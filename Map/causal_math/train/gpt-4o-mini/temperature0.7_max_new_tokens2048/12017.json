  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nGiven the knowledge of the transformed function \\\\( T[w](z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we deduce the form of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) accurately without knowing A?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function only provides information about the cumulative effect of \\\\( w(s) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) and not the specific configuration or constant A without additional information; hence, reversing the transformation to pinpoint \\\\( w(0) = e^{A \\cdot 0} \\\\) specifically isn't feasible.",
