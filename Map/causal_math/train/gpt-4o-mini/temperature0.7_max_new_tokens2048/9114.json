  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) ds\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is an input function altering the state. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(u) = Cu\\\\), where C is a constant matrix transformation applied to the input.\n\nHaving observed the system outcome \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original input function \\\\(u(s)\\\\) over [0, T] without knowing whether transformation \\\\(f(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\(u(s)\\\\) from \\\\(y(t)\\\\) without knowing about the application of \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is not feasible, as the transformation can significantly alter the input, leading to ambiguity in retrieving the exact form of \\\\(u(s)\\\\) based solely on the output.",
