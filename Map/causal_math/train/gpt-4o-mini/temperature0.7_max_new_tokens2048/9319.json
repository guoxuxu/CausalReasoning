  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(x) = Nx\\\\) (where N is another invertible matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > \\\\(t_1\\\\) still satisfy \\\\(Ax = b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since N is invertible and the original equation is \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), applying N to any valid solution at any point in time retains its validity as a solution. Even with the intervention, the fundamental nature of the matrix equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) means any transformed solution via invertible matrices remains a solution.",
