  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{i\\omega z}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\) are constants, in the context of complex function analysis. The scenario will analyze the impact when \\( z \\) is transformed by different contour integrations in the complex plane.\n\nFrom observing the result of the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over a closed contour, can one definitely infer the value of \\( a \\) without prior knowledge of \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the value of \\( \\omega \\) influences the oscillatory behavior of the exponential in \\( f(z) \\), the final integral result can be the same for different combinations of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\). This leads to ambiguity in determining \\( a \\) without specific knowledge of \\( \\omega \\).",
