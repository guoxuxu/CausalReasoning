  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega \\\\tau} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real-valued continuous function of time, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We seek to determine the implications of introducing a perturbation by the function \\\\( f(x) = x + c\\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function perturbation \\\\( g(x) = x - c \\\\) is introduced, will the resulting integral \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 reflect only the influence of the function transformations or include the effects of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then \\\\( g(x) \\\\) reintroduces \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to its original form after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), but the accumulated effects from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) due to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) still impact the integral. Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects both the perturbations and the inherent properties of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
