  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) in which both x and y are differentiable real-valued functions of t. We apply a transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) where A is a constant real number and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced accurately after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge of whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\( w(z) \\\\), the transformation offsets the initial state in an unknown way, specifically through altering the phase. Without knowing the phase change introduced by \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) precisely is infeasible.",
