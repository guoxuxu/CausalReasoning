  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix providing a linear transformation.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge of initial transformations, can we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Without entire visibility about the applications of initial transformations such as \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\), the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is generally not retrievable from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) due to potential alterations imposed by M, leading to multiple possible initial vectors that satisfy \\\\( x(t) = e^{Dt}Mx_0 \\\\).",
