  "Problem": "Analyze a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied on an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) within a linear system governed by \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\). The concern here is how transformations and external interventions affect the evolution of the system over time.\n\nWill the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) evolved from time 0 to T with \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\) result in the same final state at t = T as if it were evolved without applying \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the exponential function \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) to the initial value alters the frequency and phase of the system. This change in initial conditions leads to a trajectory that differs from a system that evolves just under \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\) affecting the final state at time T.",

The rate of change \\dot{z} impacts the state of the system at a later time z(t + Δt). The complex function e^{i\\omega t} transforms z(t), and this transformed state also affects the final state at time T.
