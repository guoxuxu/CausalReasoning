  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) on a real signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(s) z(t-s) ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( w(t) = e^{-2it} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y(t) \\\\) as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting signal at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) exhibit altered periodicities solely because of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( w(t) = e^{-2it} \\\\) does not isolate modifications to periodicities solely due to it; both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) contribute to changes in periodic structures. The combination leads to more complex frequency relationships in the resulting signal.",
