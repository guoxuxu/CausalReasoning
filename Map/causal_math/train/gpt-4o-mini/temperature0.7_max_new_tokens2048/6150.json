  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) that describes a rotating vector in the complex plane, influenced by the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We examine the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) to observe the behavior over a period \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) purely from the output of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time T without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) provides a cumulative sum over time, losing specific frequency information due to integration. This irreversible process melds the instantaneous phases and magnitudes, preventing reconstruction of the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) solely from the output at time T.",
