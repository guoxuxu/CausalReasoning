  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform in space, given by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t)\\\\), on the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new thermal conductivity profile is applied altering \\\\(k\\\\) to a new value \\\\(k'\\\\), will the final transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial thermal diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the thermal conductivity parameter \\\\(k\\\\) to \\\\(k'\\\\) during the evolution process alters the heat distribution and thus affects the Fourier transform. Since the system’s response depends on thermal diffusivity, both the initial and modified values of \\\\(k\\\\) influence the final state.",
