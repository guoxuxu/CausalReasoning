  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially applied and then the system evolves under the transformation \\\\( Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be preserved as a pure complex exponential?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) changes the nature of the complex exponential potentially altering its magnitude and rotation depending on the properties of \\\\( M \\\\). Unless \\\\( M \\\\) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, the original pure complex exponential form will not be preserved.",
