  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider the modification of the initial temperature distribution by the function \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, does the evolved temperature distribution at time t reflect only the properties of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding a sinusoidal wave, which alters the subsequent evolution of the temperature field according to the heat equation. The term \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) introduces additional spatial variation, influencing the temperature distribution over time.",
