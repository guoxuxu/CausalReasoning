  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We investigate the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\( M \\), which acts on the complex plane by the function \\( f(z) = Mz \\).\n\nGiven \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) at some point, without any additional information, can we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) before application of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( Mz \\) and the function \\( e^{iz} \\) together can create multiple potential pre-images due to the periodic nature of the exponential function and the possible non-invertibility or effects of matrix \\( M \\) on \\( z_0 \\). Therefore, it's not feasible to uniquely determine \\( z_0 \\) from \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) alone.",
