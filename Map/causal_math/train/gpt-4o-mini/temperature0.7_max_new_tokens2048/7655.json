  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) defined over complex numbers, and its transformation over time t using \\\\( T(p(z)) = \\\\int_0^t e^{z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nSuppose an intervention by applying a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z^2} \\\\) at a certain time \\( t_1 \\). Will the value of \\\\( T(p(z)) \\\\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) be effectively reset or significantly altered by \\( h(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( h(z) = e^{-z^2} \\) counteracts the effects of the original function \\( g(z) \\), potentially nullifying or reversing the accumulated effect by the time \\( t_1 \\), drastically affecting the endpoint \\( T(p(z)) \\) at \\( T \\).",
