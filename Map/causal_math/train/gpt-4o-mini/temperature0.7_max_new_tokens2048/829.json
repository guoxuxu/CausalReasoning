  "Problem": "Consider the linear operator \\\\(L[\\\\cdot]\\\\) defined as \\\\(L[x] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt\\\\), often known as the Laplace Transform. We investigate different manipulations involving a second operator \\\\(M[\\\\cdot]\\\\) defined by \\\\(M[x] = x(t-a)\\\\) for some constant \\\\(a > 0\\\\), which is a time-delay transformation.\n\nApplying the operator \\\\(M[\\\\cdot]\\\\) to a function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and subsequently applying the Laplace Transform \\\\(L[\\\\cdot]\\\\), does this sequence yield the same result as directly applying \\\\(L[\\\\cdot]\\\\) to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) without the intervention of \\\\(M[\\\\cdot]\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The delay introduced by \\\\(M[x]\\\\) translates the function by \\\\(a\\\\), so the Laplace Transform will include a factor of \\\\(e^{-sa}\\\\), which alters the original Laplace Transform of the undelayed function. This results in \\\\(L[M[x]] = e^{-sa}L[x]\\\\), not merely \\\\(L[x]\\\\).",
