  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), defined on a bounded domain with Neumann boundary conditions. We focus on the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{pt}v(x) \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) solves the Laplace equation.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T, k) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial transform \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(k) \\\\) without additional information about the time evolution or parameter \\\\( p \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T, k) \\\\) is a scaled version of \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(k) \\\\) by the factor \\\\( e^{pT} \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( p \\\\), the value or even the estimates of \\\\( T \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely reverse engineer \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(k) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T, k) \\\\) as multiple pairs of \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) could yield the same scaling factor.",
