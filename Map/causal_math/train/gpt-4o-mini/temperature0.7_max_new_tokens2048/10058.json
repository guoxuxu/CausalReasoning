  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) applied over time t, with C being another constant matrix.\n\nUpon observing \\\\( z(T) = x(T) + iy(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowledge of whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the use of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation might have altered the initial state making it impossible to backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely, especially since C, A, and B could have non-commuting effects on x and y respectively.",
