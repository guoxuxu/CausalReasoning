  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is further studied under the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with unknown application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was employed, without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or confirming the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to distinguish if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the natural progression under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) or modified dynamics due to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The transform could fundamentally alter the trajectory and final characteristics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), masking the effects solely attributed to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
