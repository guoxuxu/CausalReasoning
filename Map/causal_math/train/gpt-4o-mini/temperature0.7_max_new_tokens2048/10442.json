  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation modeled by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu(X_t, t) dt + \\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t\\\\), where \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) are functions of the state \\\\(X_t\\\\) and time t, and \\\\(W_t\\\\) represents a standard Brownian motion. We explore the effect of modifying the initial state by a deterministic transformation given by \\\\(h(X) = X + k\\\\), where k is a fixed constant.\n\nCan the original state \\\\(X_0\\\\) be precisely determined after observing the state \\\\(X(t)\\\\) at time t without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(X)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirming the application of the transformation \\\\(h(X)\\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\(X_0\\) because the shift by k could have altered the initial conditions. Knowledge of whether the transformation was applied is crucial to reconstructing the original state, as the differential terms also depend on the state.",
