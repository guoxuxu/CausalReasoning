  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) on a rod extending from \\\\(x=0\\\\) to \\\\(x=L\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature at point \\\\(x\\\\) at time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\) and its modification via a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[f](k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx}dx\\\\).\n\nIf during the temporal evolution of the heat equation, an external heat source modifies the temperature according to another function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will the temperature profile at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be dependent only on the initial profile \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and not on the modification by \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of an external heat source function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) during the diffusion process introduces new dynamics into the system. This intervention modifies the heat profile throughout the process up to time \\\\( T \\\\), making the final temperature dependent on both \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
