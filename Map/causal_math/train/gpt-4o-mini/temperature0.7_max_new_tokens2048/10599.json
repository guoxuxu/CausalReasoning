  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}\\) where \\(f(t)\\) is a time-domain representation and \\(F(s)\\) is its frequency-domain representation. The effect of an impulse response function \\(h(t)\\) on \\(f(t)\\), transformed as \\(H(s)\\), is analyzed through its impact on \\(F(s)\\).\n\nIf \\( h(t) \\) is altered to a different impulse response \\( j(t) \\) at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), and the transform \\( J(s) \\) is applied, will the resulting \\( G(s) = J(s)F(s) \\) solely depend on the new \\( J(s) \\) and not on the original \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new impulse response completely defines the transformation post \\( t_1 \\), as the convolution and subsequent transformation will now be with \\( j(t) \\), not \\( h(t) \\). Thus, the resulting frequency domain output only depends on \\( J(s) \\) and \\( F(s) \\).",
