  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is a solution, then we apply a transformation by adding a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) where \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) and examine changes in the boundary behavior.\n\nCan the original boundary values of the harmonic function \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) be recovered from the transformed solution on \\\\(\\\\partial \\\\Omega\\\\) without knowing the exact form of \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), one cannot differentiate the contributions of \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(g\\\\) to the modified boundary values, thus making it impossible to recover the original conditions of \\\\(u\\\\) alone.",
