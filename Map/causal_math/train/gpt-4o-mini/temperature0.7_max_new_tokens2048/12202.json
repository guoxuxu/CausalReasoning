  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{az^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. To analyze the transformations, we introduce the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to a different function resulting from the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nIf during transformation an additional function \\\\( h(z) = z^a \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at a certain \\\\( z_1 \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) still solely depend on the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), introducing an additional layer of complexity that alters the outcome. Therefore, the result depends on both the original exponential function and the power law introduced by \\\\( h \\\\).",
