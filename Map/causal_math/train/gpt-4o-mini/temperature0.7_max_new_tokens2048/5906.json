  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyse how this function transforms under the operation of a complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} f(x) dx \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) after observing its transform \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) as a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transform being a Dirac delta function at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\) directly indicates that the only frequency component in \\\\( z(x) \\\\) was \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\). This is due to the unique relationship in Fourier transforms where each frequency component corresponds distinctly to a delta function in the transform space.",
