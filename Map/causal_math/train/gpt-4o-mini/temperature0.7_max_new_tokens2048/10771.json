  "Problem": "Consider a model where the temperature change in a material over time is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source is introduced via a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function representing the heat input.\n\nIf an additional cooling process \\\\( g(u) = u - c(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) is another time-dependent function, is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the heat source function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will depend on the cumulative effects of both the heating and cooling functions (\\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( c(t) \\\\)), along with the original thermal diffusion process. This is because both interventions alter the temperature distribution at different times and in potentially opposing ways.",
