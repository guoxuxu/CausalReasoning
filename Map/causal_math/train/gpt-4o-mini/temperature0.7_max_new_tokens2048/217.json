  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( u(z) \\\\) represents a potential field. We're exploring the effect of a linear transformation on this field, specifically through the function \\\\( T(w) = (Aw + b) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( w \\\\) is the transformed variable.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\) on \\\\( w = z \\\\) at the initial state, and then evaluating \\\\( u(z) \\\\) at \\\\( T(w) \\\\), yield the same output as evaluating \\\\( u(T(z)) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(w) = (Aw + b) \\\\) can alter the input significantly due to changes in both magnitude and phase of the complex number, affecting the result of \\\\( u \\\\) on the transformed variable. The process of linear transformation before applying the function is not necessarily the same as applying the function directly to the transformed argument.",
