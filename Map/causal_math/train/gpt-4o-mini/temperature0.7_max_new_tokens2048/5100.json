  "Problem": "Suppose we have a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. Consider the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) where M is a square matrix, at various times.\n\nKnowing only the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine which transformations were applied (\\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( U(x) \\\\), or both), and their specific time of application?",
  "Explanation": "The state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can arise from various combinations of initial transformations, their order, and timing. Without more information about when and which transformations were applied, it is impossible to reverse-engineer the exact sequence of transformations and timings just based on the final state.",
