  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, where A is a constant complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether or not the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, it is impossible to unambiguously determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the action of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) could have altered both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Multiple initial states could lead to the same observed state at time T given different assumptions about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
