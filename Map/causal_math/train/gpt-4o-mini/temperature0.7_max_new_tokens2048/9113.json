  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) ds\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is an input function altering the state. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(u) = Cu\\\\), where C is a constant matrix transformation applied to the input.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(u(s)\\\\) from s = 0 to T, without other interventions, will the function \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u(s)\\\\) was directly used to compute \\\\(y(t)\\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying transformation \\\\(f(u) = Cu\\\\) modifies the input, hence the convolution integral changes due to different integrand \\\\(e^{A(t-s)} B Cu(s)\\\\). Since C influences the form of \\\\(u(s)\\\\), the resulting \\\\(y(t)\\\\) will differ.",
