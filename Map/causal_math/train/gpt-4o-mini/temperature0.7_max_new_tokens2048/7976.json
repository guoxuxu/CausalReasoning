  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function represents a signal in the complex plane, oscillating with time. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function to analyze its spectral properties.\n\nKnowing only the frequency domain representation with a phase shift, can we determine whether the original time domain function was \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{i\\omega t + \\phi} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency domain representation resulting from a Fourier transform does not differentiate between a signal \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and a phase-shifted version \\\\( e^{i\\omega t + \\phi} \\\\) because they both contribute identically in frequency location. The intervention causes ambiguity in determining the exact form of the original function from its spectral components alone.",
