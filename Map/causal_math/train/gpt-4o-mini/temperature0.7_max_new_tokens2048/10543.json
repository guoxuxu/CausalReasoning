  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\\\), where X and Y are complex constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of applying Fourier transformation on this signal and then modifying its spectrum by a filter function \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified by a filter \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\) such that certain frequencies are amplified or attenuated, and this modified spectrum is then inverse Fourier transformed, will the resulting signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) be the same as \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a filter function \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\) to the Fourier transform of the signal modifies the amplitude and possibly the phase of various frequency components. This results in a different spectral content, and thus the inverse Fourier transform will produce a signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) that is altered compared to the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
