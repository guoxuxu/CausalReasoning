  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane dynamics described by the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ u(t) \\} = U(s) \\) of a temporal function \\( u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\). We study the effect of a convolution operator defined by \\( h(t) \\) over the signal \\( u(t) \\), resulting in \\( v(t) = (h * u)(t) \\).\n\nIf we observe \\( V(s) \\), can we deduce \\( U(s) \\) without intervention or additional information about \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\( H(s) \\), retrieving \\( U(s) \\) from \\( V(s) \\) is not feasible directly, since \\( V(s) = H(s)U(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\) could be any function modifying \\( U(s) \\), including shifts, scaling, or filtering effects.",
