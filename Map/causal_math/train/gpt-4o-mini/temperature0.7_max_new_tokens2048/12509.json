  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + At + B \\\\), where A and B are constants. Analysis is done on the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Uz \\\\), where U is a constant matrix, that modifies the trajectory of z.\n\nCan we deduce the values of A and B by analyzing the transformed curve \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t=0, without knowing U?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing U, it is impossible to correctly backtrack and separate the effects of U from those of A and B on the transformation applied at t=0, thus complicating the precise deduction of A and B values from the modified trajectory.",
