  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and the function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane. This function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) which is the Laplace transform, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any alterations, will the transformed function \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the Laplace transform, \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\), in this scenario depends only on the parameters \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\). The transformation, given the linear and integral nature of the Laplace transform, will directly depend on and be characterized by these parameters without any external influence.",
