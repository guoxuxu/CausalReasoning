  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) and its original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). We are scrutinizing the influence of a linear operator \\\\( T \\\\) operating on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f(t)] = t \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and subsequently transformed by the Laplace Transform, will \\\\( L[T[f(t)]] \\\\) be equal to \\\\( -F'(s) \\\\), where \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) is the first derivative of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) regarding \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The action of multiplying by \\\\( t \\\\) in the time domain corresponds to the operation of taking the negative derivative with respect to \\\\( s \\\\) in the Laplace domain. This is a standard result from Laplace Transform properties, showing a direct causal transformation without modification.",
