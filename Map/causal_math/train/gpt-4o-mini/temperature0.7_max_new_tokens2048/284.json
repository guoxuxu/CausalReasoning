  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time and i is the imaginary unit. This function describes a unit circle in the complex plane. We study the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) where A is a complex number, representing multiplication and rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (values of A or B, or their sequence) were used, assuming multiple interventions might have occurred during the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Because of the complex exponential function's periodic and rotating nature, different sequences of A and B could lead to the same endpoint on the unit circle. The overlap in potential transformations makes it impossible to definitively identify the exact interventions and their sequence.",
