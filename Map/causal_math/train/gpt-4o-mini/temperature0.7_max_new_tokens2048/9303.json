  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of the integral transform \\( g(z) = \\int e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf at some point \\( z(t) \\) is modified such that \\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\delta)t} \\) for \\( \\delta \\neq 0 \\) and the transform \\( g(z) \\) is recalculated, will the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) reflect the presence of \\( \\delta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\( \\delta \\) alters the growth or decay rates along with oscillation, affecting how the transform \\( g(z) \\) processes the function. This results in \\( g(z) \\) capturing not just \\( \\omega \\) but also the effects of \\( \\delta \\), showcasing a change in the original dynamics.",
