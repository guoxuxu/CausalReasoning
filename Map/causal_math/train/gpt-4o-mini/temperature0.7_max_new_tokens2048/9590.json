  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), which transcribes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation is applied, such as \\\\( T[f](t)=\\\\int_0^t f(s) e^{s} ds \\\\), affecting the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nCan we solely from observing the transformed state \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) determine the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without knowing the specific transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed state \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), which involves the integration of \\\\( e^{it}e^{t} \\\\), does not retain clear features of the original function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), such as the periodic unit circle motion, making it impossible to deduce the original function without prior knowledge of the transformation.",
