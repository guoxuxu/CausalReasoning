  "Problem": "Consider the functional equation \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}B u(s) \\\\, ds\\\\) describing a control system where A and B are constant matrices, and u(t) is a control function. Explore the impacts of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\(T(z) = Cz(t)\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nIf the transformation T(z) is applied to the output z(0) and the system evolves normally under the given functional equation without further intervention, will the output at time T be equivalent to the output obtained when T is not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z) = Cz(t)\\\\) modifies the initial output, which alters how the system responds to the control input over time. This leads to a transformed system state trajectory, hence resulting in a different output at time T.",
