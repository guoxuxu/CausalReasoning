  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( t \\\\) is real time parameter. Assess how the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), influences the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and interpret the causal relationships.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z'(t) = (t+1)e^{it} \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and then its Fourier transform is computed, is the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all \\\\( t \\\\) solely determined by the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function itself, and thus the subsequent behavior and its Fourier transform. The alteration in form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) means that any analysis post-intervention (including Fourier transform) will reflect properties of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), not just \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
