  "Problem": "Consider a function z defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are interested in how the Fourier Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), affects this function.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention modifies z(t) to \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + e^{ivt} \\\\), where v isn’t necessarily equal to w, will the Fourier Transform at time T> t_1 only reflect the original frequency w?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( e^{ivt} \\\\) adds a new frequency component to the function. Consequently, the Fourier Transform at any time T > t_1 will reveal both frequencies w and v. The spectrum will contain delta functions at both these frequencies, not just at w.",
