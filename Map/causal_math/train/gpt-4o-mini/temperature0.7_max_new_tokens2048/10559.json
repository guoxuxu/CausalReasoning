  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), representing a rotating vector in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( w \\\\). The effect of an external transformation is considered using the operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) with \\\\( a \\\\) being a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using the transformation \\\\( M(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on \\\\( w \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( M(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional factors that affect the state at time \\\\( T \\\\). The resultant state depends on \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( w \\\\), due to the compound influences of both initial and intervention transformations modulating the trajectory and phase of the vector.",
