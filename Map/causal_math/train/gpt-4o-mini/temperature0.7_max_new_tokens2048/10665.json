  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is subject to a transformation using a linear time-invariant system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = Ay(t) + Bx(t) \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, and the transformation \\\\( h(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is a filter applied to the output signal, with C and D also being constant matrices.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( y(t) \\\\) under the system without any filter applied, will the polynomial degree of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be increased by applying the transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to it after processing?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential term \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) will introduce new dynamics to the function \\\\( y(t) \\\\), potentially increasing the polynomial degree or altering its structure, depending on the non-zero components and eigenvalues of D in relation to A.",
