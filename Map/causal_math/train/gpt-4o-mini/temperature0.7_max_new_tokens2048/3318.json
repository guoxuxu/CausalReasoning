  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the action of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to deduce the precise initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), determining the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or presence of transformation is impossible due to ambiguity in scaling effects; both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) are altered by \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
