  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent real function and \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the influence of this transformation where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function having both amplitude modulation and phase shift properties based on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by applying a scaling function \\\\( h(y) = ky \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant scaling factor) is made, will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( w \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 dependent not just on the behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) but also significantly influenced by the factors \\\\( w \\\\) (due to the initial transformation) and \\\\( k \\\\) (due to the scaling at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)).",
