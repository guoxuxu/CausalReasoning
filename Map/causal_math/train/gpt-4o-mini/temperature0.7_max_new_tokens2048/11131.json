  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents propagation in time under a harmonic oscillator dynamic with a certain frequency. We introduce an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i \\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to conclude with \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\beta t} \\\\) for remainder of the time, will the application of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) show effects dependent only on \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function's frequency from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and since the integral transform \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) accumulates the effects from 0 to T, the resulting function post-intervention isn't just dependent on the new frequency \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) but also on the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) from the transform.",
