  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables. We study the function transformation by the integral kernel \\\\( K(s, t) = e^{-st} \\\\) under operation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(s,t) f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the function output at time T, can we determine what interventions (application of function \\\\( g \\\\) or others) were used, only by inspecting transformations under \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the mixing and overlapping effects of exponential integration, different interventions might lead to indistinguishable results under the kernel operation, making it challenging to pinpoint which specific functions were used.",
