  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\) applied on a function F(s), and its subsequent inverse Laplace transformation to retrieve g(t). Analyze the influence of a linear differential operator \\( D \\), where \\( Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\) (a is a constant), on the transformed function and its retrieval.\n\nIf an intervention with another differential operator \\( E \\), where \\( Eg(t) = g''(t) + bg(t) \\) (b is a constant), is applied during the process, does the end function \\( h(t) \\) only depend on the original function \\( f(t) \\) and not on the characteristics of \\( D \\) or \\( E \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( E \\) introduces additional changes based on second-order derivatives and scaling by b, affecting the final output \\( h(t) \\). Together with \\( D \\), both transformations significantly alter the function within the Laplace domain, impacting the final inverse transform results beyond just the influence of \\( f(t) \\).",
