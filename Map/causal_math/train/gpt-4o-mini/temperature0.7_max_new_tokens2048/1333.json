  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex numbers, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are complex constants. The function’s evolution over time is analyzed considering linear transformations and their implications on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(0) = x + y \\\\) and the system evolves according to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the system at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) simply be the sum of the individual transformations applied to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the exponentiation function in the definition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ensures that the final state at time \\\\( T \\\\) is straightforwardly the sum of the transformations applied to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) separately. Therefore, \\\\( z(T) = e^{AT}x + e^{BT}y \\\\) directly results from the individual contributions of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\).",
