  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) x(t) \\\\). The signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nIf the complex function transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied initially to signal \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if the transformation was applied continuously over time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially modifies the signal at the outset and due to the nature of the differential equation, the evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) might not commute with the impact of the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, continuous application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectory of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) compared to a single initial application.",
