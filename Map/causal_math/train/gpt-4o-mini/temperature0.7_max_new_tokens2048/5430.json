  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\( \\\\Delta T \\\\) in a body is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We examine the effect of an external heating process described by \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}\\\\Delta T_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature difference.\n\nCan we determine the initial temperature difference \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\Delta T(t) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether the heating process was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) as the exponential heating could have altered the condition considerably, making deductions ambiguous unless the factor \\\\( A \\\\) is known to have not influenced the system.",
