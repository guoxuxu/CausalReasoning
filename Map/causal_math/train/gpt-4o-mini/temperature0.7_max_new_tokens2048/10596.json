  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) over a rod of length L is described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) to the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\).\n\nGiven the observed temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) at time \\( t \\), can we determine precisely what interventions (Fourier transform or heat source application) were used, solely based on \\( T(x, t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed \\( T(x, t) \\) can result from multiple configurations of interventions (e.g., different timings or intensities of heat sources) and initial conditions transformed or not. The ambiguity and overlap in possible effects make identifying specific interventions challenging.",
