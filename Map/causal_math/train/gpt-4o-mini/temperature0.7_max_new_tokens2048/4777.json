  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\), where the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) governs the dynamics of \\\\(z\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) is a vector of initial conditions. The system undergoes a transformation via another function \\\\(h(z) = Mz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) to \\\\(z(0)\\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\) for a time \\\\(t = T\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) be the same as if the initial state \\\\(C\\\\) had not been transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) initially changes the state of the system by transforming \\\\(C\\\\) to \\\\(MC\\\\). The solution then becomes \\\\(z(t) = MC e^{Dt}\\\\) as opposed to the untransformed \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\). As such, unless \\\\(M\\\\) is the identity matrix, the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will generally differ from the untransformed system's equivalent state at time \\\\(T\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition vector C causes the state z(0). The matrix D determines the evolution of the state z over time t, leading to the state z(t). The transformation function h(z) is applied to the state z(0), resulting in a transformed state. The transformed state h(z) causes the state z(T) after time T has elapsed. Therefore, the evolution of z(t) ultimately determines the final state z(T).",
