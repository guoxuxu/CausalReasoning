  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), transitioning through the system defined by \\\\(z' = z^2 + c\\\\), where c is a complex constant. This scenario examines causal inference in system's transformations and their reversibility.\n\nIf an intervention changes the constant c to a new value \\\\(c'\\\\) at a time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), will the final state at T only depend on the original parameters and not on the change to \\\\(c'\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constant c to \\\\(c'\\\\) during the evolution alters the trajectory of the complex function, thereby directly influencing the endpoints. The dependency on both initial conditions and intervened conditions means the final state at T depends on \\\\(c'\\\\) as well as the initial conditions.",
