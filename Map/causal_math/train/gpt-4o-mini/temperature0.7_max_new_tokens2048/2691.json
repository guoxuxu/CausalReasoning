  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a closed container, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity constant. We investigate the effect of a spatial transformation \\\\( u' = T(u) \\\\) where \\\\( T \\\\) is a rotation matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( S \\\\) (another rotation matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original fluid dynamics and not on the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) introduce additional rotational effects on the velocity field, affecting both the direction and interactions within the flow dynamics. The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) thus depends on initial conditions, fluid dynamics, and both transformations.",
