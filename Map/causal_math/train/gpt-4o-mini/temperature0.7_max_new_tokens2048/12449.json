  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at some time \\( T \\), can the initial condition \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(0)) \\) be accurately deduced without knowing the specifics of \\( P(D) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of the initial condition \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(0)) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) demands knowledge of the linear differential operator \\( P(D) \\), as it dictates the evolution of the frequency components of \\( z(t) \\). Without this information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the original spectral distribution.",
