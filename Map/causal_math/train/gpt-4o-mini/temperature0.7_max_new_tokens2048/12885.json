  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nCan we determine the exact state at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the initial application of \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), it cannot be determined if the observed state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) resulted from an altered or unaltered initial state, especially given that the transformation could fundamentally change the trajectory.",
