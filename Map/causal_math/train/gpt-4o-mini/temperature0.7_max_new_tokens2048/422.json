  "Problem": "Given a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( x \\\\) is a spatial variable. The function is initially defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = (K * f)(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f \\\\) is an initial function. We study how the transformation evolves under the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient.\n\nGiven the state of the function \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer the exact form of the kernel function \\\\( K \\\\) used in the initial transformation \\\\( (K * f)(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusion process described by \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) obscures the specific effects of \\\\( K \\\\) because many different kernels could lead to similar diffused states at time \\\\( T \\\\) depending on the properties of \\\\( f \\\\) and the manner of diffusion. Hence, the exact kernel function cannot be uniquely determined from the final state alone.",
