  "Problem": "Consider the mathematical system where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real number, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven that the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) results in peaks at two frequencies, \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega = B \\\\), can we determine which transformation occurred first: the original evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) or the intervention \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform presents cumulative information about frequency components without timestamps of when specific frequencies were introduced. Thus, it is indeterminable from the transform alone whether \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\) was the original or the intervened frequency, as both manifestations are symmetric in the frequency domain.",
