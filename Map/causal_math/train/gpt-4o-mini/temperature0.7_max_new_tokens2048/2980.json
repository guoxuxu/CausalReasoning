  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equations set \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + b\\\\) where A is a linear operator and b is a constant vector. An integral transformation is defined by \\\\( f(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) for a time period T.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at time T, can one deduce all the interventions applied (changes in A to D, and b to c), knowing only the final state \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral accumulation of the effects over time, multiple different interventions (or series of changes to A, b and introducing D, c) could yield the same endpoint \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Without a clear trace of how the system's dynamics were altered at each point in time, it's not feasible to uniquely backtrack all changes.",
