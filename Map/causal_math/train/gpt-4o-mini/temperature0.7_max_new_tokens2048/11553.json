  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal, respectively. Analyze the effects of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) of the signal.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the signal vector \\\\( z_0 = [u(0), v(0)]^T \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves without further interference, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly transformed under the usual process?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( M \\\\) changes the initial components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a different complex function evolution. This alteration impacts the frequency components of the transform, resulting in a different Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) at time T.",
