  "Problem": "Consider a fluid mechanic system where the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t \\\\vec{v} + (\\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{v} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{v} \\\\). We introduce a scalar field temperature \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) affected by both convection and diffusion, described by the advection-diffusion equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t T + \\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla T = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf an intervention alters the diffusion coefficient \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in a controlled manner, does the resultant temperature distribution \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the new diffusion coefficient and not on the previous velocity field changes?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the change in \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\), the temperature distribution at time T depends on both the altered diffusion dynamics and the prior state and evolution of the velocity field. The changes in \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influence the initial conditions and trajectory of temperature distribution.\" ",
