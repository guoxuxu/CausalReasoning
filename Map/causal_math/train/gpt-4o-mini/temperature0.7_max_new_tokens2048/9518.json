  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the input function. We explore the effects of applying a differentiation operator, defined by \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) = t^\\\\alpha \\\\frac{d^\\\\alpha}{dt^\\\\alpha} f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a fractional differentiation order.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) after observing its transformed form \\\\( F(s) \\\\) post-application of \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) \\\\) without knowing the order \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) of differentiation?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from the differentiated function, without the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), makes it impossible to reverse-engineer back to \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The fractional order alters the function in a non-trivial, irreversible way without additional information on the order of differentiation.",
