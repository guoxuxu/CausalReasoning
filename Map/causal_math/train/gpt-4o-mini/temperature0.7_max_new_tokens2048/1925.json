  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int e^{-sx} v(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the behavior of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(v) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the differential equation without further action, will the transformed solution at time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to directly evolving \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) under the differential equation and then applying \\\\( T(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and commutative properties of the differential operator and the integral transformation allow applying the transform to the initial condition or after evolving the function to yield the same result. This follows from the properties of linear operators and transforms under the given partial differential equation.",
