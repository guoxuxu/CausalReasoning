  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the square root of -1 and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the transformation under a subsequent function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the result of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, and no further change to the parameters (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)), will the resultant function at time 2T be the square of the function evaluated at T without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the output by squaring the complex integral result, hence changing the magnitude and potentially the phase of the original timing path of the function, making it different from merely evaluating \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at 2T.",
