  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic integral transform \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ax^2 + bx} f(t) dt \\\\), with constants \\\\( a, b \\\\) real and positive. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how the transform influences causal relationships by analyzing its effect on a specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how interventions might affect outcomes.\n\nIf a modification is made to the function \\\\( f(t) = 1024 - e^{-t^2} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), by applying a scaling factor, say \\\\( f(t) = 2f(t) \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( G(x) \\\\) be merely scaled by the same factor at all times?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling factor will indeed influence the result of the integral transform, but it will not just simply scale \\\\( G(x) \\\\) by the same factor due to the non-linear interaction within the exponential terms of \\\\( G(x) \\\\). The impact will be more complex than a straightforward scaling, especially due to the presence of the term \\\\(-ax^2\\\\) in the exponential.",
