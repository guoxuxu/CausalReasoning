  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the continuous Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-domain signal. We analyze the impact of a modulation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the final frequency spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{f}''(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine the exact sequence or individual modulation constants used (\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)), only by analyzing the shifted spectrum?",
  "Explanation": "The shifted frequency spectrum only indicates the cumulative frequency shift but does not provide information about the order or the individual values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Different combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) could result in the same total frequency shift, causing ambiguity in determining the sequence or values of interventions.",
