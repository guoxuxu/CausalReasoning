  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar. The system's evolution is assessed with and without the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real scalar.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by applying a phase shift of \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), thus altering the trajectory of the evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\). This leads to a state at time T that is modified by the initial application of \\\\( e^{iB0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but evolves differently due to the continued influence of the factors A and B.",
