  "Problem": "In a theoretical study, consider the mapping of complex variables using the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) a complex number. This function represents a rotation in the complex plane. We inspect the effects of spatial transformations by separate function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nWill the position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) on the complex plane be affected solely by the parameter \\\\( A \\\\) without any other transformation up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Without the introduction of transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolves solely under the influence of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), dictating a rotation determined by \\\\( A \\\\). Other variables like \\\\( B \\\\) have no contribution in this scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
