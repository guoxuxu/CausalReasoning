  "Problem": "Consider a signal process represented by a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = L\\{z(t)\\} \\), where \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of an input signal modified by the transformation \\( h(t) = e^{Bt} \\) on the system's response over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original signal \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( h(t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( h(t) \\), it's impossible to accurately trace back the original signal due to the potential modification introduced by \\( e^{Bt} \\), especially if B does not commute with A.",
