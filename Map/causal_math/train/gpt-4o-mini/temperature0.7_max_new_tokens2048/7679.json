  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) defines a transformation in the complex plane, with \\\\(x\\\\) as an initial complex number and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as a real constant frequency. We explore the effects of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on this function and the implications on the frequency-domain representation.\n\nIf the function is modified at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) by applying a scaling transformation \\\\(g(t) = e^{\\alpha t}\\\\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the frequency peak in the Fourier transform still occur at \\\\(\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling transformation modifies the amplitude of the function but does not affect the frequency of the original signal. Therefore, the peak in the Fourier frequency spectrum will remain at \\\\(\\omega\\\\), albeit with a potentially different amplitude and spread due to the exponential growth factor.",
