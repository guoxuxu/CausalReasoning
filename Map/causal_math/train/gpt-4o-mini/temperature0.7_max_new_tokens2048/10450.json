  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze how the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{zt} dz \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter, affects the output.\n\nGiven the outcome of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can you determine the specific \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) values used in \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation through the integral and the exponential factor introduces multiple potential combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) that can yield the same integrated result, especially considering the complex square terms and the non-invertibility of the integral transformation in a straightforward way.",
