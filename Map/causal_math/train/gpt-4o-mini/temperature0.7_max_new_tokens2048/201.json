  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a system governed by a set of linear differential equations \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable constant matrix. Investigate the effects of applying a transformation defined by the complex function \\( g(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, with \\(\\omega\\) representing a real constant frequency.\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) is applied to an initial state vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(x) \\) at the initial point modifies the input state by a rotation factor that depends on \\(\\omega\\) and \\(t\\). This adjustment changes the trajectory, making the state \\( x(t) \\) at any later time \\( T \\) different from the trajectory initiated directly from \\( x_0 \\) under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\).",
