  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and we examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. This scenario explores the transformations under different conditions and interventions using the residue theorem from complex analysis.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( f(T(z)) \\\\), can we reliably compute the original \\\\( z \\\\) value without knowing the transformation parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z \\\\) because multiple values via different transformations might yield the same output due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane and the general effect of linear transformations.",
