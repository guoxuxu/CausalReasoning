  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) denotes the temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) applied along the rod.\n\nIf at a specific moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a cooling effect described by a function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{-xt} \\\\) is introduced along the rod, will the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial condition and follow only the new intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at \\\\( T \\\\) depends on both the initial condition set by \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the intermediate intervention by \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\). The cumulative effect of the initial heat distribution and the cooling function will determine the final temperature profile.",
