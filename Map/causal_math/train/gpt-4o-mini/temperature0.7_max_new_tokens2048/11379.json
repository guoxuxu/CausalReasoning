  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform on this function.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( w(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) (also transformable) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( W(s) \\\\) only depend on the transforms of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and not on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in a new function whose Laplace transform, \\\\( W(s) \\\\), will be the sum of the individual transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( W(s) \\\\) will depend on both the components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
