  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over a period \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nGiven a nonzero result for \\\\(T(z)\\\\), can we determine whether an intervention such as a frequency shift by \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) was applied only by knowing the result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The nonzero result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) indicates a deviation from the original \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over the evaluated period, but it does not specify what kind of perturbation occurred. Various interventions could produce similar alterations in the integral transform, such as different values of \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) or even changes in the amplitude or phase of the exponential function.",
