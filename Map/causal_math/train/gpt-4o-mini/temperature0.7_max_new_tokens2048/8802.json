  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time is investigated.\n\nBased on the outcome of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} (s) \\\\), can we determine the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without knowing any other details?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} (s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) directly reveals the pole at \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\), thus allowing us to precisely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the transform outcome.",
