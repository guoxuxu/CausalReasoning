  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by \\\\( z = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We examine the response of the system under a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), which acts on \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 evolves over time without any transformation other than the inherent system dynamics, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T reflect the initial condition z(0)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a time-evolved complex exponential function essentially evaluates the frequency components present in the signal. Given that the system merely evolves without external modifications, \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) directly reflects the initial condition determined by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega 0} = 1 \\\\).",
