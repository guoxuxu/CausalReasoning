  "Problem": "Let's consider the probability density function \\( p(z) \\) that describes the distribution of a random variable \\( Z \\) undergoing the Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(z)e^{-i\\omega z} dz \\). We investigate how transformations in the time domain and frequency domain affect this PDF.\n\nIf a new function \\( r(z) = p(z) + e^z \\) is introduced at a certain time \\( t_0 \\) as an intervention before applying the Fourier Transform, will the outcome \\( \\hat{r}(\\omega) \\) at frequency \\( \\omega \\) reflect solely the characteristics of \\( p(z) \\) and not the exponential?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\( e^z \\) to \\( p(z) \\) before applying the Fourier Transform results in a new function \\( r(z) = p(z) + e^z \\). The Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{r}(\\omega) = \\hat{p}(\\omega) + \\hat{e^z}(\\omega) \\) reflects the influences of both the original function \\( p(z) \\) and the exponential \\( e^z \\), altering the emergent transform compared to \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\).",
