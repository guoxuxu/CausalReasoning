  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( t \\) represents time. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\( F(z) \\) which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into its frequency components \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\( z_0(t) \\) exactly after observing \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) without knowing if any modification, such as a time shift, was applied before the Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is sensitive to initial conditions and transformations applied to \\( z_0(t) \\) like time shifts. Without knowing these modifications precisely, reconstructing \\( z_0(t) \\) exactly from \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) is not guaranteed due to potential alterations in phase or other characteristics embedded in the frequency components.",
