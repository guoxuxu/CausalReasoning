  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) refers to time. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the function and consider intervention through an inverse Laplace transform at different times.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined from its Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) uniquely specifies \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) due to the one-to-one nature of the Laplace transform for functions of this specific form, assuming initial values and boundary conditions typical in causal inference.",
