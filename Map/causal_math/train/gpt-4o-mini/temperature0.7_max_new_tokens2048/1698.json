  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature T in a region evolves according to the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Suppose a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied, the added sinusoidal perturbation might have altered the initial conditions in a manner that spreads and merges with the native thermal profile, making it impossible to isolate and identify the original condition \\\\( T_0 \\\\) uniquely.",
