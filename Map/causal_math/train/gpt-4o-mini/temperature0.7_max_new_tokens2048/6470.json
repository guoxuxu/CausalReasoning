  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nAfter applying the FT to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\), can we accurately determine that the original signal was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "With only the Fourier Transform outcome of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), and not knowing about the pre-transformation multiplication by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), it is impossible to reconstruct the original signal uniquely. The frequency shift could mask or mimic effects of other potential transformations.",
