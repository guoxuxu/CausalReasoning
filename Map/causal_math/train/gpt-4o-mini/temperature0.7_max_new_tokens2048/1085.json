  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane which is governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on this function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without any further changes, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved up to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) alters the original amplitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by a factor of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha T} \\\\). This results in a different trajectory and endpoint because the amplitude growth introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) modifies how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves from its initial state.",
