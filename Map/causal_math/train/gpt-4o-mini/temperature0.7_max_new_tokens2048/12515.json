  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving a system of linear equations encoded by matrix operations. Let \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) represent the system with matrix A and vector b. Consider the impact of pre-multiplying both sides by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) (where M is an invertible matrix).\n\nGiven the solutions to the transformed systems \\\\( M(Ax) = Mb \\\\) and \\\\( N(Ax) = Nb \\\\), can we deduce the specific matrices M and N used, solely based on the consistency of the solution with \\\\( Ax = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformations using M and N do not change the solution \\\\( x \\\\), multiple different matrices M and N can lead to the same result if they are invertible. Thus, solely from solution consistency, the specific matrices M and N cannot be uniquely determined.",
