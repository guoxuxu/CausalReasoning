  "Problem": "Consider a linear electrical circuit analysis where the voltage, \\\\( V(t) \\\\), across a resistor and inductor in series is described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), with R as resistance, L as inductance, and I as the current. Let's analyze the scenario where an operation is performed to transform the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) by a function \\\\( h(I) = I^2 \\\\) just before starting the system.\n\nCan we determine whether the initial current was squared (\\\\( h(I) \\\\) was applied) or not simply by knowing the observed current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on whether the squaring function was applied, and with potentially different circuits or voltages leading to similar current patterns at t = T, it is impossible to infer unambiguously the exact nature of the starting current.",
