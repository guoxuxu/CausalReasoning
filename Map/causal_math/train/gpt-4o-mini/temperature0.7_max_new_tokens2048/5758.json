  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can you conclusively determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could have altered \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a way that modified how the differentials evolved over time.",
