  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) be the same as without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the phase of the signal uniformly across all time, resulting in a phase shift in the Fourier transform. This phase shift does not change the amplitude spectrum but alters the phase spectrum, indicating a causal effect from the transformation to the frequency domain representation.",
