  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing the motion of a particle in a plane, influenced by the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduces a rotation by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), which modifies the initial condition. This changes the trajectory in the complex plane, leading to a potentially different position at time T compared to evolution without the transformation.",
