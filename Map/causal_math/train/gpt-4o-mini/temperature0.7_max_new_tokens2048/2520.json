  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The Laplace Transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how changes in the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) influence the transformed function over the complex plane.\n\nAfter observing the modified Laplace Transform of the intervened function \\\\( h(t) = t^k e^{-at} \\\\), can we determine precisely the original values of both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) just from the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The modified Laplace Transform for the function \\\\( t^k e^{-at} \\\\) results in a form \\\\( \\\\frac{k!}{(s + a)^{k+1}} \\\\), allowing for the unique extraction of both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) from the transform’s exponent and coefficient. Given this mathematical relationship, both parameters can be precisely determined.",
