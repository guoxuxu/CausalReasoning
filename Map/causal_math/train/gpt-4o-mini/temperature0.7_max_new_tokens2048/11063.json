  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We study the effect of a linear transformation of variables defined by the matrix \\\\( T = \\\\begin{pmatrix} P & Q \\\\\\\\ R & S \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), applied initially at time t = 0.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new transformation \\\\( U \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is made (where \\\\( U \\\\) is another constant matrix), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the original differential equations and not influenced by \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a new transformation \\\\( U \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent not just on the original matrices A, B, C, and D but also significantly influenced by both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\). Their cumulative effects alter the trajectory and, thus, the final state.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation matrix T influences the state z(t), which directly affects the variables x(t) and y(t). The variables x(t) and y(t) are governed by their respective differential equations, which relate their rates of change to their current values. Additionally, the intervention by the transformation U also impacts the state z(t) and subsequently affects x(t) and y(t). Therefore, both T and U causally influence the final state z(T).",
