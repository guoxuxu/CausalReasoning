  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit composed of a resistor (R), inductor (L), capacitor (C), and a power source that applies a voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system is described by the differential equation \\\\( V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int_0^t I(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the current as a function of time.\n\nIf a parallel resistor \\\\( R_2 \\\\) is added into the circuit as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the steady state current depend only on \\\\( R \\\\) and not on \\\\( R_2 \\\\) or \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a parallel resistor \\\\( R_2 \\\\) alters the overall impedance of the circuit, contributing to the total effective resistance and modifying the response of the circuit to the input frequency. Both the magnitude and phase of the steady state current will depend on \\\\( R_2 \\\\) in addition to the existing parameters \\\\( R \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\).",
