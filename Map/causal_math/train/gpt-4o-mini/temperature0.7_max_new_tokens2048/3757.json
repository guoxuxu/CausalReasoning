  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. This function represents a simple harmonic motion on the complex plane. We examine the effects of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a constant integer, on the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then the function is allowed to evolve under the original definition of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( f(z(t))  \\\\) at time t = T equate to raising \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to the power n?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) applied initially impacts the system by changing the state. However, evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) will yield \\\\( f(z(t)) = (e^{i\\omega t})^n = e^{in\\omega t} \\\\), which matches the outcome of applying \\\\( f \\\\) at a later time T, hence \\\\( f(z(T)) = (e^{i\\omega T})^n = e^{in\\omega T} \\\\).",
