  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the dynamics of this function under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we exactly deduce the intervention value \\\\( u \\\\) if we observe the Fourier transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) concentrated at a frequency different from \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the original frequency was known to be \\\\( w \\\\) and the observed peak in the Fourier transform occurred at \\\\( w+u \\\\), we can explicitly calculate the intervention value \\\\( u \\\\) as the difference between the observed peak and the original frequency \\\\( w \\\\).",
