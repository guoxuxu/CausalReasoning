  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix and z is a complex variable. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) on the behavior of the system.\n\nGiven the final state of the function at z = Z, after both an integral and a differential intervention were applied, can we determine which order the interventions were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The differential operation cancels out the effect of the integral transformation, making the final state indistinguishable in terms of the order in which the operations were applied. The function reverts to its original state, obscuring details about the sequence of transformations.",
