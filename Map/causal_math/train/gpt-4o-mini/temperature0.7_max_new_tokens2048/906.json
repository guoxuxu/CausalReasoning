  "Problem": "Consider the linear system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We investigate the behavior of the system under the influence of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) denotes the Fourier transform and \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nCan we deduce the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing the intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Since the evolution in Fourier space directly corresponds to the evolution in physical space due to the commuting nature of the Fourier transform with linear partial differential operators, we can revert the steps using an inverse Fourier transform to find \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\).",
