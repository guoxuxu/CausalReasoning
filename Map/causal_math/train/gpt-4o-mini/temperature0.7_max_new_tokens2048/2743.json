  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex growth rate. We are examining the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda s} z(s) ds \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf an additional operation \\\\( H(z) = z + \\\\delta \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is a constant) is applied at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( H(z) \\\\), independent of the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added operation \\\\( H(z) \\\\) introduces yet another factor affecting \\\\( z(T) \\\\), but the overall state at \\\\( T \\\\) still retains dependencies on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) due to their roles in the dynamic equation. Both the original equation and the sequential transformations impact the endpoint.",
