  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. Assume an external transformation is defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{wt}z \\\\), where w is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition of the system to \\\\( e^{wT}z_0 \\\\) before it follows the dynamics governed by the differential equation. Since the transformation \\\\( e^{wt} \\\\) modifies the initial state and the transformation is dependent on \\\\( t \\\\), the trajectory and final state at time T will differ.",
