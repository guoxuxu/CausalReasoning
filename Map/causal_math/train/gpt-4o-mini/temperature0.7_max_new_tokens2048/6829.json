  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system evolves over time t and undergoes an integral transform using the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further modification, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at s = \\\\( \\\\omega + i\\\\beta \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real constant) uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), thereby clearly indicating the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in its denominator. Therefore, identifying \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at any complex s is straightforward and unique.",
