  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where A is a real constant and x is a complex initial state. Consider the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to \\\\( T \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined and transformed without any alterations or manipulations, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) display characteristics solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and independent of \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) depends on both the frequency component \\\\( A \\\\) as part of the exponential term and the initial state \\\\( x \\\\). The characteristics of \\\\( x \\\\) impact the magnitude and phase of the Fourier transform, making it dependent on \\\\( x \\\\) as well as \\\\( A \\\\).",
