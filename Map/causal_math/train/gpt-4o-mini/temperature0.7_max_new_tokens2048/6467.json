  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We investigate the causal effects of operations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and their expression through the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is scaled by a constant factor k, will this scaling be directly observable in \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at any later time T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "While the scaling will affect \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and thus \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the exact nature of the scaling might not be directly detectable through \\\\( g(z) \\\\) due to the integration over all time; other time-mediated transformations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could yield similar modifications in the integral result.",
