  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\\n\nIf \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is computed for \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without further alteration to the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\), does the Laplace transform inherently account for all properties introduced by the factor \\\\( e^{ax^2} \\\\) in \\\\( z(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform directly incorporates and transforms any modifications introduced by the function \\\\( e^{ax^2} \\\\) into the new domain. Therefore, it fully accounts for the impact of this factor.",
