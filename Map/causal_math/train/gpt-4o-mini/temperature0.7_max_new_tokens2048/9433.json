  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the impact of a transformation using Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if no Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the representation from time domain to frequency domain and does not affect the state dynamics directly. However, the initial application of the Fourier transform doesn't modify the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself in the time domain; the resulting Fourier transform at time \\\\( T \\\\) reflects the state evolved from the original, untransformed \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",
