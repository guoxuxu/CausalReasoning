  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the integral transform \\( I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant complex function. This scenario explores how varying \\( s \\) and operations on \\( f(t) \\) affects the transformation result.\n\nIf a scaling operation \\( g(t) = k \\cdot e^{At} \\) is applied as an intervention at some point with \\( k \\) being a constant, does \\( I(s) \\) remain solely dependent on \\( s \\) and \\( A \\), disregarding \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling intervention modifies \\( f(t) \\) to \\( g(t) = k \\cdot e^{At} \\) which impacts \\( I(s) \\), making it \\( k \\) times the integral of the original \\( e^{At} \\), showing dependency on \\( k \\), in addition to \\( s \\) and \\( A \\).",
