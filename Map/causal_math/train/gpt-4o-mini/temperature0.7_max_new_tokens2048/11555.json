  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal, respectively. Analyze the effects of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) of the signal.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( N = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the effect of \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The second transformation with matrix \\\\( N \\\\) modifies the state trajectory anew, and thus the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\) depends on both matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\). These changes are reflected in the overall transformation effects on the frequency spectrum.",
