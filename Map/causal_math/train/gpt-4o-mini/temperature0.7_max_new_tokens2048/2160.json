  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform at \\( t = \\infty \\), can we determine whether the signal was first modified by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) then by \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\), or not modified at all?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences of exponential decays can lead to similar frequency shifts and broadenings. Due to the overlapping effects in the frequency domain alterations caused by multiple interventions, the exact sequence of decay implementations cannot be uniquely determined just by observing the end-state Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) undergoes a Fourier transform to yield a frequency domain representation. The inclusion of the exponential decay e^{-\\alpha t} modifies z(t) before the Fourier transform, impacting the resulting frequency domain representation. Similarly, the addition of e^{-\\beta t} also alters z(t) prior to its Fourier transform, affecting the frequency domain representation and the ability to determine whether the signal was modified.",
