  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is a finite upper limit.\n\nGiven the transform output \\\\( F(z) \\\\) up to time T, can we uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t without knowing the value of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\), it is impossible to reverse the transformation effects captured by \\\\( F(z) \\\\), as different values of \\\\( s \\\\) can lead to different forms of decay and thus modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that cannot be accurately reverted.",
