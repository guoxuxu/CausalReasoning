  "Problem": "Consider the application of a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We analyze the impact of this transformation over time when the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is combined with another transformed function under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G'(\\\\omega) \\\\) after specific known interventions in both the time and frequency domains, can we determine \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the interventions accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Even if the transformations are known, the overlapping effects of multiple interventions (like filtering in the frequency domain and then transforming) can lead to multiple function forms that fit the final transformed result \\\\( G'(\\\\omega) \\\\). This makes it challenging to uniquely determine both the original function and the exact interventions.",
