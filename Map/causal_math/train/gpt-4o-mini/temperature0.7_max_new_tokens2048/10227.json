  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by the heat equation in a rod, described by \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the position along the rod. Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) to the equation and the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) after a specific time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + v \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a disturbance function, is applied as an intervention, will the resulting temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the behavior according to \\\\( ku_{xx} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with function \\\\( g(u) \\\\) introduces an additional term, modifying the temperature distribution in ways not dictated solely by the heat equation. This results in a deviation from the expected distribution based solely on the unmodified heat equation.",
