  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where z(t) is a complex function and s is a complex parameter. This transformation is a Laplace transform of the function z(t). Study the implications of differentiating and integrating the function z(t) under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[z](s) = F(s) \\\\), can we specifically deduce the exact function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional conditions or information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform used to recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[z](s) \\\\) is not unique without specific boundary or initial conditions. Multiple functions can result in the same Laplace transform, demonstrating non-uniqueness without further data.",
