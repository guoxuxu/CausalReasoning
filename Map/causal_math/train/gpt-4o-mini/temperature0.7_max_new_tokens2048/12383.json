  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. This integral transformation is used to analyze the behavior of z(t) in the frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine precisely which interventions (out of transformations by B or A) were applied to obtain the endpoint \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at s=B, given only the final form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-B} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific form of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-B} \\\\) pinpoints that the intervention applied was the transformation with the constant B, directly indicating the cause from its unique effect. Other interventions would produce differently structured transforms.",
