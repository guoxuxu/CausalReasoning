  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. We examine the impact of the Laplace transform on this function and how it influences the causal structure of the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven that the Laplace transform results \\\\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s + \\gamma - i\\omega} \\\\) can we precisely determine the values of both \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) only with this transform?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = -\\gamma + i\\omega \\\\) directly yields both \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The real part of the pole, \\\\( -\\gamma \\\\), and the imaginary part, \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can be distinctly identified, thereby accurately determining both the damping factor and angular frequency.",
