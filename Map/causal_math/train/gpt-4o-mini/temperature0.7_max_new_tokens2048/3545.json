  "Problem": "Let us consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We analyze how this function transforms under the application of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) and also how it behaves when modified by a scheduled intervention described as multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), will the transformed function at time t be the same as the initial function \\\\( z(0) = e^{i0} = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( Dz(t) = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it} = iz(t) \\\\) alters the function by multiplying it with i. This results in a rotational transformation in the complex plane, and therefore, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at each t ≠ 0 is not equal to \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the function z(t) over time causes it to transform under the differential operator D, resulting in z'(t). The initial value of the function z(0) equals 1, which is derived from evaluating z(t) at t=0. Multiplying z(t) by a complex constant c modifies the function to c*z(t), and this modification also transforms under the differential operator D to yield c*z'(t).",
