  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed using \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to analyze its behavior over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from different sequences or magnitudes of interventions due to the scalability in amplitude introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). These transformations modify the trajectory in potentially overlapping ways, making it challenging to untangle and uniquely identify the interventions used.",
