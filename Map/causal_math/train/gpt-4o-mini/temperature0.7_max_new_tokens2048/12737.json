  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier-transformed representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we precisely deduce the original time-domain function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) provides a complete frequency-domain characterization of the function, which is a reversible transformation. Knowing the Fourier-transformed function at any time allows for an exact reconstruction of the original function at any other time, including \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), by applying the inverse Fourier transform.",
