  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then let to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) alters the magnitude of the complex number, modifying its trajectory from the outset. As \\\\( k \\\\) increases or decreases the magnitude exponentially, the evolved state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), differs in magnitude compared to direct evolution under the differential equation alone.",
