  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts evolving over time t governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\) where P and Q are complex constants. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z dt \\\\) where S is a complex constant matrix.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a specific time T, can we infer the original complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) significantly impacts the trajectory, and without this knowledge, it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation modifies the evolution path in a non-trivial way.",
