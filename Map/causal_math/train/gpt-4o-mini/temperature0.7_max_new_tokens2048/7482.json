  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We also define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, applied to the function z over the time period t.\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely deduced after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to trace back accurately to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation can modify initial conditions in a way that could render multiple potential original states \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially when C does not commute with A and B.",
