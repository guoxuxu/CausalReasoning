  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. Analyze the effect of applying a linear time-invariant system transformation characterized by the impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) for \\\\(t \\\\geq 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the input was the original \\\\(V(t)\\\\) or its transformed version without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The observed current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) alone does not provide enough information to unambiguously determine if the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was applied. Both the original and the transformed voltage sources could potentially lead to the same current due to the linearity and time-invariance of the system.",
