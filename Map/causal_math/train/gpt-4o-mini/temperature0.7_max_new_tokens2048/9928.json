  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Let's analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number with positive real part.\n\nGiven only the transformed result of an intervened function, can we determine if the original frequency was \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or the modified one \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) in the absence of the knowledge about the exact time of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation result \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega'}\\\\) does not contain information about when the intervention changed \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\). Without this temporal detail, we cannot ascertain if the transformation corresponds to the original or the modified frequency, nor the precise moment of frequency change.",
