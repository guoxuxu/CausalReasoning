  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain variable.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as an intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( \\omega \\\\neq 0 \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) adds non-linear dynamics to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting all frequency components. The resultant \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) depends on both the original function and the intervention, influencing various frequency components, not just \\\\( \\omega \\\\neq 0 \\\\).",
