  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), commonly known as the heat equation, where D is a diffusion constant. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation given by \\\\( g(u_0) = u_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a function representing a heat source distribution.\n\nCan we determine the original initial temperature profile \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\( g(u_0) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial condition was altered by \\\\( h(x) \\\\), it is impossible to reliably backtrack and determine the exact profile of \\\\( u_0 \\\\). The changes induced by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) in the temperature distribution cannot be deduced from the final state due to the diffusive nature of the heat equation.",
