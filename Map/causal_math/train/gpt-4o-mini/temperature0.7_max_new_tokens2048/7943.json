  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time, evolving according to the linear differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), respectively. A Laplace transform is applied to both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), creating a transformed function \\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\).\n\nIf at a time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention alters \\( x(t) \\) to \\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\) where D is a constant, will \\( Z(s) \\) depend solely on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), irrespective of \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\( x(t) \\) to \\( x'(t) \\), changing its subsequent trajectory and thus affecting the Laplace transform \\( X(s) \\). This change in \\( X(s) \\) in turn alters \\( Z(s) \\). Therefore, \\( Z(s) \\) will depend not only on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) but also significantly on \\( D \\).",
