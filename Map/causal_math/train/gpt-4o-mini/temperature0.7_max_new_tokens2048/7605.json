  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^k e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We also consider the impact of Laplace transformation on this function, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nWill applying the Laplace transformation to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then computing the inverse Laplace transform result in the same function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation and its inverse are designed to be inverse operations. Assuming all conditions for the existence of the Laplace transform and its inverse are met (such as convergence of the integral), applying these operations in sequence will recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
