  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, is examined over time.\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to accurately reconstruct the original trajectory \\\\( z(t) \\\\) within the interval [0, T] without prior knowledge of the transformation's application?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is a form of averaging and smoothing over the interval, losing specific details and phases of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and making it impossible to precisely recover the original function over the interval only from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\).",
