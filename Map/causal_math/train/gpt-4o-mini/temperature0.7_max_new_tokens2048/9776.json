  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system that filters an input signal x(t) using a transfer function H(s). We examine how impulse response h(t), which is the inverse Laplace Transform of H(s), affects the output y(t) of the system.\n\nGiven the output y(T), can we determine precisely which impulse responses (original h(t) or modified h'(t)) were applied throughout the system's operation?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of input signals and impulse responses (both h(t) and h'(t) applied in varying sequences) could yield the same output y(T). This ambiguity prevents the precise determination of what specific impulse responses were applied during the system's operation.",
