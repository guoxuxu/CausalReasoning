  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving in time under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) are real constants reflecting oscillatory and exponential behaviors, respectively.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (initial, and at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)), using only the data of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from multiple exponential transformations affecting both magnitude and phase, making it difficult to distinguish between the compounded effects of the initial transformation and the intervention without additional information about the time or nature of the intervention.",
