  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) representing the Laplace transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) models a physical system's response to an input signal, and we explore the effects of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with a convolution operation using another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan one identify the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) precisely by observing the output \\\\( H(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, without knowing if any convolution was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied, simply observing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Convolution could modify \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in a way that is indiscernible solely from \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
