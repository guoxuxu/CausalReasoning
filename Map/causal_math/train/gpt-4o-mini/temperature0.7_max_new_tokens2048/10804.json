  "Problem": "Consider the complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). Investigate the effects of a transformation by matrix \\( M \\) where \\( M \\) effects the amplitude and frequency. The transformed variable is \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\). Let's analyze using variable separation and integral transformations.\n\nKnowing the end state \\( u(T) \\), can we ascertain which transformations were performed (by \\( M \\), \\( N \\), or both) throughout the evolution process?",
  "Explanation": "The problem lies in the non-unique effect matrix operations might have on \\( z(t) \\); similar pathways could ultimately yield the same \\( u(T) \\). Lack of information about temporal details of interventions and their nature adds to indeterminacy.",
