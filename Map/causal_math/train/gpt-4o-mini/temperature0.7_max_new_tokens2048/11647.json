  "Problem": "In a theoretical study, consider the mapping of complex variables using the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) a complex number. This function represents a rotation in the complex plane. We inspect the effects of spatial transformations by separate function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iB(T-t_1)}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be independent of the parameter \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional rotation by \\\\( B \\\\) in the interval \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\). The final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus becomes dependent on both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\), resulting from the compositional effect of both rotations.",
