  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is used to transform an initial condition in a spatial eigenfunction problem governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -Au + iBu \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original state of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(T) \\\\), without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( u(T) \\\\) without knowing the details of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or if it was applied complicates the recovery of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) because the transformations due to \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) alter the phase and amplitude in a way that is dependent on the specifics of the initial conditions and the duration of time.",
