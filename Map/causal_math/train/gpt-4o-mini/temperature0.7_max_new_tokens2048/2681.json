  "Problem": "Examine a response system governed by the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\) of a function \\(x(t)\\). Assume an exponential function \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) acts on \\(x(t)\\) and modifies its behaviour in the Laplace domain.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) to \\(x(t)\\) before taking the Laplace transform alter the transformed function \\(X(s)\\) such that \\(s\\) is replaced with \\(s-k\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\(\\mathcal{L}(e^{kx}x(t))\\) results in a modified Laplace transform where every instance of \\(s\\) is substituted with \\(s-k\\). This represents the frequency domain scaling effect due to exponential time-domain multiplication.",
