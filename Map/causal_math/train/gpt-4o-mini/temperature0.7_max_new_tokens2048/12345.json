  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform on the function, defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\), can we reconstruct the exact original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any loss of information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is a bijective transformation for functions that meet certain conditions (like being square-integrable). Therefore, the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) can indeed be reconstructed exactly from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) using the Inverse Fourier Transform.",
