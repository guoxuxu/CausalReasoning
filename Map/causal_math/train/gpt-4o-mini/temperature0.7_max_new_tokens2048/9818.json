  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time t according to the integral transform \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with K(s) being a complex kernel function. The initial condition at t = 0 is \\\\(z_0\\\\). An intervention function \\\\(h(t, z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without any knowledge of the kernel function K(s)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of K(s), it's impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\(z_0\\\\) since different kernel functions could produce the same endpoint from different initial conditions.",
