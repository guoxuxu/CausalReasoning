  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function is subject to transformations using Fourier transforms over time.\n\nIf the system is intervened with another function \\\\( w(t) = e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) at time t = t_1 by multiplying, will the function at time T > t_1 be the simple product of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) without considering their individual transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication of these exponential functions results in their frequencies being added, resulting in a transformed function with a frequency of \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\beta \\\\). Therefore, their interaction creates a new frequency component which isn't a trivial product of the two functions at time T but instead follows the combined behavior of their frequency sums.",
