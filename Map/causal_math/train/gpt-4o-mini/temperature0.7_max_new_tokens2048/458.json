  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), and consider its Laplace transform, which gives a function in the complex plane. Assume that this function represents the transfer function of a control system, where a and b are constants.\n\nGiven the output and knowing \\\\( z(s) \\\\), can you uniquely determine the input to the system without knowing additional conditions or interventions?",
  "Explanation": "No, because multiple different input signals can result in the same output due to the properties of Laplace transforms and convolution. The system might also have inherent properties (like zero states) that can affect the input needed to achieve a particular output.",
