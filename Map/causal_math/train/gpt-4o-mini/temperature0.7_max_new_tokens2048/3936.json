  "Problem": "Consider a fluid mechanic system where the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t \\\\vec{v} + (\\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{v} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{v} \\\\). We introduce a scalar field temperature \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) affected by both convection and diffusion, described by the advection-diffusion equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t T + \\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla T = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nGiven the observed temperature field \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) at a later time T, can we precisely discern if changes were made to the diffusion coefficient \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\), or to the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature field at time T, being influenced by both advective motions from \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) and diffusion effects from \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\), does not offer a clear causal pathway to determine whether only one or both parameters were altered. Changes in temperature can be a result of variations in either or both influencing factors, making exact deduction unfeasible.",
