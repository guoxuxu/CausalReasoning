  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output, \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is derived from the input, \\\\( x(t) \\\\), via a complex function and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bx(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential.\n\nCan we establish the precise initial input signal, \\\\( x(0) \\\\), by solely examining the output, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), at some time T without further knowledge about the input's evolution over time?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a cumulative function of all past values of the input, integrated with a transformation factor \\\\( e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}B \\\\). Without additional temporal details about the input, deducing \\\\( x(0) \\\\) just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is underdetermined as multiple input profiles could lead to the same output.",
