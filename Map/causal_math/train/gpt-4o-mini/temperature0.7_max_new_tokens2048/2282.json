  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We explore the effects on the function after applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), we cannot accurately backtrack to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha T} \\\\), which might modify both the magnitude and phase of the initial value in an irreversible way.",
