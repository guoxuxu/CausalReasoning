  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. To analyze causal inferences, we introduce an integral transform \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a function alteration \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another complex constant) is applied at a certain midpoint \\\\( t_2 \\\\), does the ultimate function form \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) for T > t_2 depend only on P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new influencing factor. The final form of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) is a product of the cumulative effects of P, Q, and now R, integral and exponential transformations potentially alter the trajectory considerably.",
