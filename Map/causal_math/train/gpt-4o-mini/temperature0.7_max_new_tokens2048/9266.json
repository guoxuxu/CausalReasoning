  "Problem": "Consider the balance of a linear mechanical system with mass, spring, and damper. The governing differential equation is \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} + c\\\\dot{x} + kx = 0 \\\\), where m is mass, c is damping coefficient, k is spring constant, and x is displacement.\n\nGiven a system's displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), is it possible to unequivocally determine whether the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was zero without knowing the values of m, c, and k?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the values of m, c, and k, it's impossible to backtrack accurately and determine the specific initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) just from observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The system's behavior can be similarly expressed under different parameter combinations.",
