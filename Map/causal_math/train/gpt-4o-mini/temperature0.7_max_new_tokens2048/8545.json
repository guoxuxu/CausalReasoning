  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is initially governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is introduced where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then the system evolves naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t still follow the trajectory as if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Ct}z(0) \\\\). This alteration affects the evolution path of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) as they are scaled differently due to the real and imaginary components of C, leading to a trajectory distinct from the untransformed one.",
