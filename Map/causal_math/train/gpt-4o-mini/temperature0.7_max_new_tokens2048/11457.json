  "Problem": "Combining a Fourier transform with complex functions, consider a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transform given by \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} s(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\). Let the effect of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( s(t) \\\\) be defined as a multiplication by a fixed complex exponential, i.e., \\\\( L[s(t)] = e^{\\\\alpha t} s(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nDoes applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and then computing the Fourier transform result in a shift in the frequency domain compared to the original \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) shifts the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( s(t) \\\\) by \\\\( -\\\\alpha \\\\) in the frequency domain due to the properties of the Fourier transform of exponential functions. This results in the transform \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega - \\\\alpha) \\\\).",
