  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We evaluate the function under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(u) du \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( g(h(z)) \\\\), is it possible to precisely trace back to the original z or distinguish between transformations like \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\), just using the output?",
  "Explanation": "Distinguishing between transformations based solely on \\\\( g(h(z)) \\\\) is not feasible, as both \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( z^3 \\\\) or other polynomial transformations may lead to similar integral results. Multiple transformations can lead to the same resulting function value due to the nature of complex function integrals over variable and complex paths.",
