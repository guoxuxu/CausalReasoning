  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system having an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). An operator \\\\( G \\\\) defined by \\\\( Gx(t) = x(t - \\tau) \\\\) acts as a delay of \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds on the input.\n\nIf we apply the operator \\\\( G \\\\) to the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and observe the system's output, does the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) only shift temporally following the delay introduced by \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G \\\\) results in the input signal being delayed by \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds, thus the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will indeed be a temporal shift of the original output by \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds, expressed as \\\\( y(t) = (x(t - \\tau) * h)(t) = (x * h)(t - \\tau) \\\\). This preserves the original output characteristic, just shifted.",
