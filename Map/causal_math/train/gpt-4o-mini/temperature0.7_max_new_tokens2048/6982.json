  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. This system undergoes an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x t} f(t) dt \\\\), and we explore the influence of this transformation on the system's behavior.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was initially applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional data about the intermediate states or the knowledge of the exact effect of \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(0) \\\\), deducing the application of the transformation from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is ambiguous, especially due to the complexity introduced by the Fourier transformation.",
