  "Problem": "Consider the process of heat transfer in a one-dimensional metal rod subject to external temperature effects. The change in temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of the rod over time t and position x is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\) an external source changes the temperature profile to \\\\(u(x,t_1) = v(x)\\\\), will the temperature at a later time T depend solely on the thermal diffusivity constant k?",
  "Explanation": "The new temperature profile \\\\(v(x)\\\\) introduced as an intervention fundamentally alters the conditions from that instant onward. Thus, the temperature at time T, while depending on the diffusivity k, also significantly depends on the new profile \\\\(v(x)\\\\) imposed at time \\\\(t_1\\\\).",
