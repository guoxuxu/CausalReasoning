  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. This function is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\). We analyze the impact of altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) through an applied transformation \\\\( g(t, z) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real number.\n\nIf an intervention altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) is done at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and not on \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) while the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) persists, affecting the trajectory resulting in a final state at time T dependent on both the original transformation by \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and the change to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\). Therefore, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\).",
