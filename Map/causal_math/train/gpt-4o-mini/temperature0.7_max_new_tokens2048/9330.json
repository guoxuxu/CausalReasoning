  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sw}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a function and \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x(s)e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) after applying \\\\( g(x) = x(s)e^{as} \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original function \\\\( x(s) \\\\) from the new \\\\( z(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the original function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) output to \\\\( z(w-a) \\\\) making it difficult to determine if the shifting is due solely to the exponential factor \\\\( e^{as} \\\\) or initial variations in \\\\( x(s) \\\\). The inverse problem does not yield a unique solution without additional constraints or information.",
