  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nCan we infer the original function around the contour C from the modified integral result of \\\\(\\\\oint_C e^{z^2}/(z-a) dz\\\\), knowing only that a transformation of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) might have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge that \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, and only observing the modified integral, it's impossible to definitively deduce whether the integral involved just \\\\(1/(z-a)\\\\) or \\\\(e^{z^2}/(z-a)\\\\), particularly without extra information about C and \\\\(a\\\\).",
