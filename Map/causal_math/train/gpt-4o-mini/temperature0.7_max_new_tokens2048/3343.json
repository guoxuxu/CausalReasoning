  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature \\\\( T \\\\) affects the rate of a chemical reaction according to the Arrhenius equation, given by \\\\( R(T) = A e^{-\\\\frac{E}{RT}} \\\\), where \\\\( E \\\\) is the activation energy, \\\\( R \\\\) is the gas constant, and \\\\( A \\\\) is a pre-exponential factor. We need to also consider an intervention by adjusting the temperature profile over time with a function \\\\( f(t) = T_0 + kt \\\\), where \\\\( T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature and \\\\( k \\\\) is the rate of change of temperature.\n\nIf an intervention changes the temperature profile to \\\\( f(t) = T_1 + kt \\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the reaction rate \\\\( R(T) \\\\) at time t > t_1 only depend on the initial parameters (\\\\( T_0 \\\\), \\\\( k \\\\)) and not on \\\\( T_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the temperature profile, introducing \\\\( T_1 \\\\) as a new baseline temperature after \\\\( t_1 \\\\). This change impacts \\\\( R(T) \\\\) directly due to its dependency on \\\\( T \\\\), thus the reaction rate at times t > t_1 depends on the current temperature profile including \\\\( T_1 \\\\).",
