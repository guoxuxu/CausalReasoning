  "Problem": "Study a system governed by \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants, and consider the integration through a transform \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) applied to the variable \\( z = x + iy \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nSuppose an intervention applies a new transformation \\( S(z) = z^2 \\) at some point \\( z_1 \\) resulting from \\( T(z) \\) from a starting \\( z \\) that satisfies \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\). Will \\( S(z_1) = z_1^2 \\) necessarily satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The double application of transformations \\( z^3 \\) followed by \\( z^2 \\) greatly modifies the original properties and relations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\( z \\), disrupting satisfaction with \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\) unless very specific conditions are met, which are generally not expected.",
