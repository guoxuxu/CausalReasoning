  "Problem": "Consider a vector-valued function z(t) defined in a complex domain and governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), where M is a 2x2 matrix. An integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Mt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied. The transformation is modified by a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nBased on the outcome of \\( T(z)(T) \\), can we infer the original vector \\( z_0 \\) and whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The action of \\( f(z) \\), by modifying the initial conditions through complex exponentiation, obscures the original state \\( z_0 \\) and the precise nature of its phase shift. Without knowing the application of \\( f(z) \\), the original state cannot be uniquely determined from \\( T(z)(T) \\) alone.",
