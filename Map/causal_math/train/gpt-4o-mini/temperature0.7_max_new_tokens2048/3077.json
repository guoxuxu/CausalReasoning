  "Problem": "In the context of signal processing, consider a system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) passes through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We study the causal inference of output \\( y(t) \\) resulting from the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) applied to \\( x(t) \\) with frequency representation \\( X(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and similarly \\( Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = H(\\omega)X(\\omega) \\), where \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the transfer function of the system.\n\nIf \\( x(t) \\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform and then processed by the LTI system, will \\( y(t) \\) at any later time \\( t \\) necessarily reflect only alterations due to \\( H(\\omega) \\) applied to \\( X(\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is LTI and the transformation is linear, the resulting \\( y(t) \\) only depends on the input \\( X(\\omega) \\) and the system's response \\( H(\\omega) \\). The transformation \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) linearly represents \\( x(t) \\) in the frequency domain where it is directly modified by \\( H(\\omega) \\).",
