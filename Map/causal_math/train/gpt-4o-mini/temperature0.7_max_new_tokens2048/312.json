  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex number. Analyze the mappings when transformed by this exponential function in the complex plane, considering different paths in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing the resultant value of \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z)g(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), can we accurately identify the contributions from function modifications at all points along C?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations due to both A and B across the contour C can create complexities that result in similar results from different combinations of path and function alterations. Without precise mappings or additional constraints, these contributions remain indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning.
