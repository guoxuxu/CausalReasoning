  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is the solution to the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\), and K is a constant matrix. Explore the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(w) = e^{Dt}w \\\\) at various times, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to unequivocally determine the initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) offers limited information. The additional complexity due to the matrix \\\\( D \\\\) altering initial conditions and the underlying time evolution via \\\\( K \\\\) introduces ambiguities in back-calculating \\\\( w_0 \\\\).",
