  "Problem": "Consider a functional relationship expressed as a complex integral transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} h(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a known time domain signal and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the impact of a Laplace transform on the signal's properties.\n\nIf the signal \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is altered to \\\\( h(t) + ke^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants, and no further modification is made, will the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) simply exhibit additive terms corresponding to the modification?",
  "Explanation": "Laplace transformations are linear. Altering the input signal by adding \\\\( ke^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) will manifest in \\\\( H(s) \\\\) as an additive term \\\\( \\\\frac{k}{s-\\\\lambda} \\\\), influencing the output straightforwardly by the linearity of the transformation.",
