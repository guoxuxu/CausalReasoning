  "Problem": "Analyze a heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, representing heat transfer in a one-dimensional rod. The function \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x)\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is a spatial heat source distribution that varies with position \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(u)\\\\), it is not feasible to distinguish if the observed state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) resulted directly from \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) or from \\\\(u_0(x) + h(x)\\\\). The additional heat source \\\\(h(x)\\\\) modifies the evolution in a way that is irreversible and non-unique without prior information.",
