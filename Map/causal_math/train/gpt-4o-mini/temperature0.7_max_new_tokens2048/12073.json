  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and matrices A, B, C, and D are constants. We investigate the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) for a constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the exact original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) was applied, and not knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back and confirm \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as changes induced by the transformation can't be reversed uniquely without this information.",
