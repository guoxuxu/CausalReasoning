  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\), where k is a complex constant, and its response to the Laplace transform deformations described by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transformation without any manipulation at initial time or during its transformation, will the result \\\\( L(z) \\\\) depend solely on the parameter k?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform directly translates the dynamical behavior of \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\) into the s-domain without intervention. Since k defines the frequency and growth rates of the function, the resulting transform \\\\( L(z) \\\\) will specifically reflect changes only caused by k, generating \\\\( L(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-ik} \\\\) assuming real part of s is greater than the real part of ik.",
