  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and we examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. This scenario explores the transformations under different conditions and interventions using the residue theorem from complex analysis.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed, will this result in the same outcome as applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and transforming the result using \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation before or after the function yields different results due to the non-commutative nature of addition and exponentiation in the complex plane. Specifically, \\\\( f(T(z_0)) = e^{az_0 + b} \\\\) which does not equal to \\\\( T(f(z_0)) = ae^{z_0} + b \\\\), thus changing the nature of the outcome.",
