  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = R(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\) describing the trajectory of a particle in the complex plane, where \\\\( R(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the radial and angular components, respectively. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time t = t_1, an intervention with a new function \\\\( h(z) = z e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied, will the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and only reflect the effects of \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at t_1 modifies the trajectory again, superimposing an additional phase shift of \\\\( \\\\beta t \\\\) onto whatever effect \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) had accumulated up to t_1. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the original transformation and the intervention, depending on the interplay of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The radial component R(t) and the angular component θ(t) each directly influence the position z(t) of the particle. The function g(z) transforms z(t) and affects the position z(T) for T > t_1. The intervention h(z) also transforms z(t) and influences z(T). The constant ω influences g(z), while the constant β influences h(z). Therefore, the position z(T) will depend on the transformation through h(z) and reflect the effects of β, while being independent of ω due to the intervention at time t_1.",
