  "Problem": "Imagine a function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a complex constant. We explore the evolution of this function when subjected to transformations by linear operators in the form of integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the parameter a from the Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), knowing no changes or interventions were made?",
  "Explanation": "The parameter a can indeed be uniquely determined if no interventions were made, since the form of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) points directly and only to the value of a.",
