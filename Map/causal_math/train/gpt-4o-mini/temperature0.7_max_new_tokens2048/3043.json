  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the phase changes introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further complicates the dependency of the final state on both the initial transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will reflect the cumulative effect of these transformations, resulting in a state dependent on both the respective phase shifts.",
