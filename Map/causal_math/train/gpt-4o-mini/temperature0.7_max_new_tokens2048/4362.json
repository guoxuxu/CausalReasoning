  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the analysis focused on the effect of a complex integration transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{a}^{z} f(w) dw \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(w) \\\\), which is analytic in a domain D. Assume \\\\( a \\\\) is a fixed point within D.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(w) \\\\) be uniquely determined by knowing the function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) across domain D, without any additional information or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(w) \\\\) can be uniquely recovered from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) by taking the derivative, \\\\( f(w) = F'(w) \\\\). Since \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is a definite integral of \\\\( f \\\\), its derivative will reveal \\\\( f \\\\). This relationship is direct due to the fundamental theorem of calculus for complex functions.",
