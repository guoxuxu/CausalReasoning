  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\\\), where X and Y are complex constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of applying Fourier transformation on this signal and then modifying its spectrum by a filter function \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\).\n\nGiven the altered signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) obtained after filtering and inverse Fourier transforming, can we precisely determine the original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the filter applied \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\) only from knowing \\\\( z'(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modified signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) could result from various combinations of original signals and filter functions. Without additional information about either the original signal or the exact nature of the filter function, it is not possible to uniquely reconstruct the original conditions and interventions.",
