  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution condition.\n\nFrom observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively infer the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) if it was transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) without knowing it?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) changes the base frequency spectrum of the distribution, and these changes evolve in time due to the heat equation. Without knowledge of the use of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), one cannot accurately back-calculate the precise original distribution from the final state.",
