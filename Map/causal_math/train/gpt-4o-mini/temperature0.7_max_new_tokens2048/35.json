  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Consider modifying this system using a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) as a real constant.\n\nIf a further modification \\\\( j(z) = e^{\\\\beta s}z \\\\) is applied to the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) a real constant, will the composition of both transformations and the original system ensure that the state at any time T > t_1 depends only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention by \\\\( j(z) \\\\) superposes another exponential scaling factor, which again affects the trajectory from that point forward. The system state depends on \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), thereby influencing the final state at any subsequent time T.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The change in z(t) over time leads to a differential change expressed as dz/dt, which is determined by the complex function involving the constants ω and k. The transformation h(z) affects the state of the system, and the subsequent transformation j(z) further modifies that state. Ultimately, the state at time T is influenced by ω, while the effects of α and β are not present in the final state.",
