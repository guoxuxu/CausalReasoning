  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to the function, which then defines a new function \\\\( Z(s) = L\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\), and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is then transformed back without further intervention, does the resulting \\\\( z(t) \\\\) match the original function for all t?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the inverse Laplace transform to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\) correctly recovers the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). This is because the Laplace and its inverse transform are linear, and their operations cancel out under ideal conditions without modifications.",
