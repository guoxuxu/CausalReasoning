  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function in a variable \\\\( t \\\\). The dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant. We test the effects of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by scaling and possibly rotating the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will be impacted by these changes, leading to a different state at time \\\\( T \\\\) compared to the evolution without the transformation.",
