  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a linear time-invariant system where the complex impedance (Z) of the circuit is formulated as \\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} \\), and s is the Laplace transform variable. We explore the effects of adding a parallel capacitor with impedance \\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\) to this system.\n\nIf the parallel capacitor is connected and then the system is left to respond to a sinusoidal input without further intervention, will the steady-state output of the system be the same as it was without the capacitor?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a capacitor alters the denominator of the system's transfer function due to the parallel combination of impedances, which changes the system's poles and therefore its response to the same input.",
