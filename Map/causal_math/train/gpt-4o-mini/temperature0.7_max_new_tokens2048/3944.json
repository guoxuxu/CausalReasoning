  "Problem": "Assume we have a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex square matrix that represents the system's dynamics. Assume further that we can apply a transformation function \\\\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( D \\\\) another complex matrix.\n\nGiven the system's end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify which transformations were applied (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), both or neither) just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex dynamical evolution involving multiple transformations through matricial exponentials complicates backward tracing. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from various combinations of interventions with \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), and potentially could even be due to different parameters within those functions not distinguishable solely by the outcome.",
