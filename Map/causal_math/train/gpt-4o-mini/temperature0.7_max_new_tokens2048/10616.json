  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is a finite upper limit.\n\nCan one accurately determine the original function components \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\) solely from knowing the transformed result \\\\( F(z')(T) \\\\) when both frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) were present?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of different frequency components in the integral transformation, and without distinct separability in the frequency domain within the given integral boundaries, it is impossible to precisely discern contributions from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\) in the transformed output.",
