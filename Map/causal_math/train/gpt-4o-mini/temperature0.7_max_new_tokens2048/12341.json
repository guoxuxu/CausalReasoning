  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. Let's examine the system's behavior under the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and perform perturbations using multiplication by another function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive real constant.\n\nGiven the frequency spectrum \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) without knowing the original function, can we deduce that \\( z(t) \\) was \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) uniquely results in a Dirac delta function precisely at \\( \\omega \\), \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\xi) \\). The unique correspondence allows us to deduce the original function \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) from its spectrum.",
