  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is the temperature at a point \\\\((x, y)\\\\). We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions, defined by the function \\\\(g(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(x, y)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) describes initial temperature distribution along the boundary.\n\nCan we deduce the original boundary function \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) after achieving steady-state solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) without any additional information about the Fourier transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) from \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) without knowledge of the specific Fourier components used in \\\\(g(s)\\\\) is infeasible, as many different boundary conditions could lead to similar steady-state distributions inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) due to the loss of information in transformation.",
