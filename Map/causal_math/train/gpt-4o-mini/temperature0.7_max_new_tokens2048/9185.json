  "Problem": "Consider the integral equation of the form \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix determining the system's dynamics and f(s) is a vector function. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform and its inverse on this system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 by a scalar factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and the system evolves under the given integral equation, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) differ from the scenario where \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is not modified?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( f(s) \\\\) at t = 0 by multiplying by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) alters the entire function subsequently affecting the integral equation's output. The Laplace transform, being a linear operator, will reflect these changes, resulting in a different \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) compared to the unaltered function.",
