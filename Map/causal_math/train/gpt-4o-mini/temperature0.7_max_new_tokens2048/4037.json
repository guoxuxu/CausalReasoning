  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is to be considered.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the initial condition by squaring the complex number, which affects the subsequent evolution of the system. The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will thus be different because the initial magnitudes and angles in the complex plane have been altered.",
