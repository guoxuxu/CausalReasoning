  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) which converts function u(x, t) into its frequency components U(k, t).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(U(k, T)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the Fourier transform was explicitly mentioned as being applied, knowing \\\\(U(k, T)\\\\) allows us to use the inverse Fourier transform to retrieve \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) and to deduce the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) by solving the PDE backwards, assuming L is conducive to such operations.",
