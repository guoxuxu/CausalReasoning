  "Problem": "Consider a vector field expressed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. Analyze the effect when a Möbius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\) is applied to z, where a, b, c, d are complex constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{pz + q}{rz + s} \\\\) (where p, q, r, s are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both the original Möbius transformation and the new intervention. Each transformation can fundamentally change the trajectory and hence the endpoint by modifying the complex plane in which the dynamics occur.",
