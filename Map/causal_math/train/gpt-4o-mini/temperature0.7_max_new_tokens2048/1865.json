  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) is considered for modeling the effect of time-dependent rotations on this system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by the natural evolution governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) does not alter the system's natural orbit trajectory in this specific scenario. Both initial conditions, whether transformed or not, will rotate about the origin at the same rate per the governing equation, leading to equivalent positions at t = T.",
