  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter and \\\\( i \\\\) the imaginary unit. This function represents the solution to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). We examine the effect of applying a linear operator, represented by matrix A, to alter the function: \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention with another operator B (where \\\\( g(z) = Bz \\\\)) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the function at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), resulting in \\\\( z(t_1) = B(e^{i\\\\omega t_1}Az_0) \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega (T-t_1)}z(t_1) \\\\), clearly depending on both A and B, as they shape the function's evolution post-intervention.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is influenced by the frequency parameter ω, as it defines the behavior of z over time. The application of operator A alters z to produce f(z), while the application of operator B further modifies z to yield g(z). The state of the function z at time T is dependent on the transformations applied by A and B, but ultimately relies on the frequency parameter ω for its fundamental characteristics.",
