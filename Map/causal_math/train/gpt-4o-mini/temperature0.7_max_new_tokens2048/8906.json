  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its impact when integrated over a contour in the complex plane. The contour described by the path \\\\( C \\\\) is parameterized by \\\\( z(t) = a + te^{it} \\\\) for \\\\( t \\\\) ranging from 0 to 2\\\\pi, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the value of the integral of \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) over a contour \\\\( C \\\\), can we determine the specific path or parameters (such as \\\\( a \\\\)) of \\\\( C \\\\) just from the integral value?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral can depend on both the specific path taken and the complex function characteristics. Similar integral values might result from different paths or parameters, making it infeasible to uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) just from the integral value.",
