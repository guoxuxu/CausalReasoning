  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant thermal diffusivity. Examine the impact of applying a transformation with the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the exponential term \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) in the initial condition via \\\\( f(u) \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectory of \\\\( u \\\\) such that the original \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified at t = T without knowing whether the transformation was applied, because the differential equation's evolution will mask the added term's effects.",
