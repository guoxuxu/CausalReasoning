  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a linear operator. We examine the role of a transformation initiated by \\(\\Gamma(z) = Qz\\), \\(Q\\) being another linear operator, applied at an initial time \\(t = 0\\).\n\nAfter observing \\(z(T)\\) following the evolution \\(t = 0\\) to \\(T\\), can we determine whether the transformation \\(\\Gamma(z)\\) was applied at the initial time without knowing \\(Q\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\(Q\\) or confirmation of its application, tracing back to the exact initial conditions \\(z_0\\) or \\(Qz_0\\) is ambiguous. The observed state \\(z(T)\\) could result from several different configurations of initial states and transformations, especially if \\(Q\\) and \\(M\\) are not explicitly known or characterized.",
