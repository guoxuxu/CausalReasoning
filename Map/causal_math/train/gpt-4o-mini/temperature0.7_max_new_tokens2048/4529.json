  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the Schrödinger-like equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. An intervention is defined by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\), where B is another constant matrix different from A.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\\\\) is given and the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) without any intervention, will the trajectory remain unchanged after applying the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) changes the initial conditions and thus alters the trajectory from what it would be under the evolution \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) alone. The influence of B introduces an exponential modulation by \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) that affects both the magnitude and phase of z.",
