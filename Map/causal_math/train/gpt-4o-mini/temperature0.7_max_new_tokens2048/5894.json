  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t. Analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the function.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, is it possible to precisely determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, assuming no other information but \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is available?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific value of a, or whether a transformation was applied at all, multiple scenarios could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). For example, differing values of a could adjust the phase and amplitude at t = 0 such that they evolve to the same point at T, due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane.",
