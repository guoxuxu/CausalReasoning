  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) applied to the components \\\\( (x, y) \\\\) of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original vector components \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( M \\\\), reconstructing the initial conditions \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) solely from the observed end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is indeterminate. The altered path due to the linear transformation \\\\( M \\\\) introduces ambiguity, making it impossible to uniquely identify the original state without additional information.",
