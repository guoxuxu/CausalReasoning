  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) on an infinite rod, where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) represent the partial derivatives of temperature \\\\(u\\\\) with respect to time \\\\(t\\\\) and the second spatial derivative with respect to \\\\(x\\\\), respectively. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x, t) \\\\, dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the new transformation with \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) or just the original setup), only by knowing the value of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The altered temperature profile at time T might result from several different intervention scenarios or just the natural solution to the original heat equation, modified perhaps by initial or boundary conditions not accounted for. The introduction of \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) complicates the trajectory, making it impossible to accurately back-calculate the exact interventions or initial conditions without additional information.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The thermal diffusivity constant k causes changes in the temperature with respect to time (u_t). Changes in temperature over time (u_t) lead to changes in the spatial temperature distribution (u_{xx}). The initial temperature distribution (u(x,0)) is transformed into the Fourier transform representation (\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)). The Fourier transform (\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)) allows us to derive the temperature distribution at a later time (u(x, T)). Finally, the temperature distribution at time T (u(x, T)) provides insights into the interventions that were applied.",
