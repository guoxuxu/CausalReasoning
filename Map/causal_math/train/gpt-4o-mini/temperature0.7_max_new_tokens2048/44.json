  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function and its subsequent inverse transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) to understand causal relationships.\n\nGiven the transformed function in the s-domain, can it be determined if the original function was replaced during the intervention, and what the new parameter \\\\( b \\\\) was, merely by examining the final result?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Laplace transform, which shows \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\), directly identifies \\\\( b \\\\) as the new pole reflecting the modification made during the intervention. This transformation is specific and allows for the determination of whether the function has been replaced and the value of \\\\( b \\\\).",
