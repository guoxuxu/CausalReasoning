  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period T.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( x \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T without knowing the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates over a period that precisely corresponds to a whole number of the function's oscillations (assuming \\\\( \\omega T = 2\\pi n \\\\), n being an integer), it effectively averages out to x. This allows for uniquely determining \\\\( x \\\\) if \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and T are known.",
