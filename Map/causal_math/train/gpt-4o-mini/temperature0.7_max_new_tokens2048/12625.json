  "Problem": "Let us consider a complex function initially defined on the real axis: \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are real functions representing components in the complex plane. A transformation \\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\), where A is a complex constant and t is time, is applied.\n\nGiven \\( z(T) \\) at time T, can we deduce the original function at \\( z_0 \\) knowing only that the transformation \\( f(z) \\) could have been applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( f(z) \\) could involve a complex exponential function that changes both magnitude and phase of \\( z_0 \\), without specific knowledge of A, retrieving \\( z_0 \\) from \\( z(T) \\) accurately is not possible, as multiple original conditions could lead to the same \\( z(T) \\).",
