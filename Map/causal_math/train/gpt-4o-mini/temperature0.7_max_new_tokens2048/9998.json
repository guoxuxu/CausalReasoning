  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a complex constant.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the transformation through \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) may have altered the initial conditions in a way that cannot be uniquely retraced, especially if D and C are such that they don't commute.",
