  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Investigate the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the wave profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we identify definitively the interventions (application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\)) used during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions solely from the final wave profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is challenging, as different sequences and types of Fourier transformations could yield similar profiles, especially given the transformations' ability to modify amplitude and phase relations non-uniquely.",
