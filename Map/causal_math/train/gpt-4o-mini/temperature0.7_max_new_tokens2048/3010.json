  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number. Further, an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied, which maps the function into the Laplace transform space.\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) only by knowing the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) if no information about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Without the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it's impossible to correctly invert the Laplace transform and uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is essential as it deeply influences the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
