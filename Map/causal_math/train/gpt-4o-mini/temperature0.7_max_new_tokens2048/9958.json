  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u(x,t) = -\\\\lambda u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the state of the system at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) which converts the spatial component to the frequency domain.\n\nAfter observing the transformed state \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can we deduce the initial transformed state \\\\( F(u)(k, 0) \\\\) without knowing the form of the original spatial domain function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and invertible nature of both the Fourier transform and the temporal evolution dictated by the partial differential equation, one can uniquely reverse the temporal evolution in the frequency domain and apply the inverse Fourier transform to retrieve \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). The process is deterministic and reversible.",
