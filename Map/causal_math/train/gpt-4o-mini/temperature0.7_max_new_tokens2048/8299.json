  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a contour integral transformation on a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) by proposing the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin and t is a real-parameter.\n\nIf a further transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_D e^{sz} dz \\\\) (where D is another contour and s is a different real parameter) is applied sequentially after \\\\( T(z) \\\\), does the final result only depend on the shape of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final outcome now depends on both transformations, \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\), involving the parameters t and s as well as the contours C and D. The multiple influences from these factors extend beyond merely the original function form, impacting the overall result significantly through the integrative transformations.",
