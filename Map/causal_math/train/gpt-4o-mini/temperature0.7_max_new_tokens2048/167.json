  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane over time t. Analyze the transformations applied by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and the implications of these transformations over time.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) differ from the state had only \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) been applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) adds another transformation influencing the development of the system, resulting in \\\\( z(t)^3 \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, impacting the trajectory distinctly compared to an evolution influenced only by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). This results in a change in both the frequency and the angle traversed in the complex plane.",
