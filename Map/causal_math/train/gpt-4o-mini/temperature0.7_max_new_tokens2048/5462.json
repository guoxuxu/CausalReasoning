  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\( g(x) \\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely recover \\( x_0 \\) just from \\( x(t) \\) at t = T. The transformation \\( Q^{-1} \\) could have modified \\( x_0 \\) to a new state that evolves differently under \\( K \\).",
