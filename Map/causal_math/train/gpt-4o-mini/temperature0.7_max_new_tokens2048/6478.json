  "Problem": "A vector field $V(z)$ in the complex plane behaves according to the equation $V(z) = z^n$ where $n$ is an integer. We examine the consequences of applying a transformation $f(z) = e^{i \\theta}z$ where $\\theta$ is a constant angle.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector $z_0$ after observing $V(z(t))$ at $t = T$ without knowing whether $f(z)$ was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether $f(z)$ was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine $z_0$ since any rotation by $f(z)$ could lead to the same end result $V(z(t))$ for different starting points $z_0$, due to the multiplicative nature of complex exponentiation.",
