  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). This transformation is used in analyzing a system's behavior, where s is a complex variable. The function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) is subjected to a transformation where it is multiplied by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, resulting in a new function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}t^2 \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation by multiplying by \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) (where b is a constant) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will the Laplace transform of the resulting function depend only on the initial transformation parameter a?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) results in a compound effect, resulting in a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{(a+b)t}t^2 \\\\). The Laplace transform will then be \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = 2/(s-(a+b))^3 \\\\), which clearly depends on both a and b, not just a.",
