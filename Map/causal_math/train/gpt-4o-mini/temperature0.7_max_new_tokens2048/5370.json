  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the vector field is governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L \\{ v(t) \\} = sV(s) - v(0) \\), with \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\) where A is a constant matrix. We'll examine the effects of perturbing this system with another transform \\( f(v) = e^{Bt}v \\) where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\( v(T) \\) resulting from evolution under \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\), can we trace back to determine the original vector \\( v_0 \\) without knowing whether \\( f(v) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lack of information about the application of \\( f(v) \\), which includes the transformation \\( e^{Bt} \\), obscures the ability to determine \\( v_0 \\) uniquely. The transformation could have altered the initial state in a way that isn't directly reversible especially if B modifies the dynamics non-trivially relative to A.",
