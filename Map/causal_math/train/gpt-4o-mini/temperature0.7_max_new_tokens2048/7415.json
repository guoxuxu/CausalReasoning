  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit involving a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We analyze the response of this system to a complex input signal \\( x(t) \\) using the Laplace transform, where the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) is \\( X(s) \\) and that of \\( h(t) \\) is \\( H(s) \\).\n\nIf an additional filter with impulse response \\( g(t) \\) is applied to the system after the input \\( x(t) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will \\( y(t) \\) at \\( t > t_1 \\) be dependent only on \\( x(t) \\) and not on \\( h(t) \\) or \\( g(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introduction of a new filter \\( g(t) \\) alters the system's characteristics, making the output \\( y(t) \\) at \\( t > t_1 \\) a result of the convolution between \\( x(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\), and \\( g(t) \\). The output hence depends on all three components: the original input, the impulse response of the original system, and the impulse response of the new filter.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The input signal x(t) transforms to X(s) in the Laplace domain, while the impulse response h(t) transforms to H(s), which influences the output y(t). Additionally, the impulse response g(t) transforms to G(s) and also influences the output after filtering. Therefore, the output y(t) is affected by both the input x(t) and the system responses h(t) and g(t).",
