  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We consider the impact of an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\) applied to \\( z \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the outcome \\( T(z) \\) at time \\( T \\), can we distinctly determine what transformations were used (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( S(z) \\), or both) based purely on the transformed result at \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The functional forms of \\( T(z) \\) and \\( S(z) \\) might yield similar results due to overlapping effects of their exponential terms in the integral transformations. This similarity can obscure which transformations were applied or in what sequence, making it unclear from the outcome alone.",
