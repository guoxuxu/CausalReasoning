  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nKnowing only the spectrum \\( z(w) \\) and assuming the original function was \\( \\phi(t) = e^{-at} \\), can we precisely determine if there was an additional decay term \\( e^{-bt} \\) applied over time without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific details about the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) or without separate characterizations of the effects of each on the spectrum, it is impossible to discern whether the spectrum \\( z(w) \\) corresponds to additional exponential decays applied over time or simply the term \\( e^{-at} \\).",
