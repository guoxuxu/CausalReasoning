  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions. The transformation involves the application of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by a simple harmonic motion and later subjected to the Fourier transform, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), show peaks only at the natural frequencies of the initial harmonic motion?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies. Since the initial motion is harmonic, the transform will exhibit peaks specifically at these natural frequencies, reflecting the signal's frequency content without alteration.",
