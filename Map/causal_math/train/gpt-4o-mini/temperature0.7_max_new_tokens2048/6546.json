  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator to produce an output \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nCan the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without auxiliary information about the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\), multiple input signals could potentially yield the same output, leading to an ambiguity in determining \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The kernel's properties are crucial in defining the transformation's mapping from input to output.",
