Explore the impacts of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\(T(z) = Cz(t)\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nKnowing the final output z(T), can the specific interventions (whether T(z), S(z), or both) be uniquely determined solely based on the value at T?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of transformations T(z) and S(z) can yield identical or indistinguishable outputs at T due to the linear properties of transformations and overlapping effects on the system trajectory. This ambiguity prevents unique identification of which interventions were applied.",
