  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where z(t) is a complex-valued function, to explore integral transformations. Let's investigate the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a square matrix and x is a constant vector.\n\nKnowing \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at a particular time T, can we infer the exact initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) without additional information on the transformation applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( f(z) = (sI-A)^{-1}x \\\\) from the Laplace transform and its inverse properties, one can solve for \\\\( x \\\\) directly if the matrix \\\\( (sI-A) \\\\) is invertible. Hence, the knowledge of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at any point allows for the deduction of \\\\( x \\\\).",
