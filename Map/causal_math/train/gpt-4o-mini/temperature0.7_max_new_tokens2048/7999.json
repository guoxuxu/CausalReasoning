  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant denoting angular frequency. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iws}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), altering the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be determined uniquely by \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without considering \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the addition of \\\\( c \\\\) fundamentally changes the trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a function not only of \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) but also of \\\\( c \\\\). This alters both the amplitude and phase, impacting the superposition and resulting state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
