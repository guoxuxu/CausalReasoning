  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapped in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants, over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, merely by knowing the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be achieved from varying combinations or applications of transformations due to the nature of complex function operations. It's challenging to pinpoint whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or a combination was implemented, especially without additional data about phase and magnitude changes at intermediate points.",
