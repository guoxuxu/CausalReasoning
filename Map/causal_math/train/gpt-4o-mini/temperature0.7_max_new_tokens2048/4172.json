  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and the function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane. This function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) which is the Laplace transform, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we determine if the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) was altered (increased by \\\\( \\delta \\\\), for example) given the final Laplace transform output along with knowledge of the original \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Laplace transform results in distinct outputs for different \\\\( \\omega \\\\) values and knowing \\\\( s \\\\), one can infer changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) such as an increase by \\\\( \\delta \\\\) based on differences in the expected functional form of the transform result. The transformation's sensitivity to changes in frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) allows for this determination.",
