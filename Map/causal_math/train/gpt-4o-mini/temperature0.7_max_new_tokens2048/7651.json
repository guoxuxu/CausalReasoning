  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, acting on the time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). We examine the effect of Fourier Transform on \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and explore how these transformations influence causal relationships.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional exponential modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention on \\\\( y(t) \\\\), will the subsequent Fourier Transform of the result show that the original frequency content of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) remains unaltered?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the exponential modulation \\\\( m(t) \\\\) which counters the effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\) effectively demodulates the signal back to its original frequency content. The Fourier Transform then will display the original spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any shift, as the modulations cancel each other out.",
