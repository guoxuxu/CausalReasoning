  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is the speed of sound in a medium. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} u(t) dt \\\\), on the transformation of the equation.\n\nIf a filtering process described by \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), a frequency-dependent function, is introduced as an intervention after applying the Fourier transform, will the solution at t = T still solely depend on the initial behavior of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of the solution according to its transfer function. This alteration impacts the resulting time-domain solution after applying the inverse Fourier transform, meaning the outcome at t = T is affected by both the initial conditions and the nature of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
