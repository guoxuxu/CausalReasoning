  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the state is evolved using a linear time-invariant differential equation described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The study will explore the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( F(x)(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the precise form of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) without knowledge of the application of \\\\( F(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform integrates the function across all time, altering it significantly, and the inversion process requires knowledge that \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was applied. Without this knowledge, recovering the exact initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) just from \\\\( F(x)(T) \\\\) is indeterminable.",
