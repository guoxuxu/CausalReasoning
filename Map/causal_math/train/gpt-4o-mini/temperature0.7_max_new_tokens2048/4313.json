  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and A, B, C, D are constants. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](s) \\\\) and its inverse on the dynamics of this system.\n\nIf the initial condition is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the original differential equations without further transformation, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend uniquely on the transformed initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the entire spectral composition of the initial condition, impacting how frequencies evolve over time. Given the system's dynamics involve transformations affecting both the real and imaginary parts, the final state would not only depend on the transformed initial state but also on the interaction between these dynamics over time.",
