  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s\\\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period from 0 to T.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed function from 0 to T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the function could represent a variety of initial conditions or transformations, and the effect of the integral transformation obscures the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
