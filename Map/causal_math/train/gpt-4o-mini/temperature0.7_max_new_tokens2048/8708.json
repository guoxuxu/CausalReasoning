  "Problem": "Analyze a transfer function H(s) in the Laplace transform domain. Consider a linear system characterized by H(s) = 1/(s^2 + as + b), where a and b are constants. Let's study the impact of applying a unit step input U(s) = 1/s, and how it influences the system response.\n\nGiven the output Y(T) after time t1, can we decide which specific intervention (either changing constants to c, d or maintaining a, b) occurred by solely analyzing the value of Y(T)?",
  "Explanation": "The output Y(T) could potentially be achieved through multiple configurations of the system parameters (a, b, c, d). The net impact of different gain and pole changes introduced by various interventions could result in similar or indistinguishable system outputs at T.",
