  "Problem": "Let us consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) represents a control input vector. The Laplace transform \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) applied to this system results in \\( X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + (sI - A)^{-1}x(0) \\) where \\( U(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\).\n\nAssuming the control input \\( u(t) \\) is a constant vector \\( u_0 \\) from \\( t = 0 \\), with no further changes, will the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) at any \\( s \\) differ if \\( u(t) \\) had been a different constant \\( \\tilde{u}_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The constant control inputs \\( u_0 \\) and \\( \\tilde{u}_0 \\) result in different Laplace transforms due to their impact in the term \\( (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) \\). Since \\( U(s) \\) and hence \\( X(s) \\) directly depend on the value of the control input \\( U(s) = \\frac{U_0}{s} \\), where \\( U_0 \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( u_0 \\), different control inputs lead to different system responses in the Laplace domain.",
