  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. A linear transformation by a complex matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function, resulting in \\\\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven some observations of \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can the exact times and nature of switches between matrices (\\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or back to \\\\( M \\\\)) be deduced merely through these observations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potentially complex interference patterns and the general non-uniqueness of matrix effects in complex function transformations, exact times and sequences of matrix switches cannot be uniquely determined from endpoint observations alone. Multiple transformation paths might result in the same or similar observed endpoints.",
