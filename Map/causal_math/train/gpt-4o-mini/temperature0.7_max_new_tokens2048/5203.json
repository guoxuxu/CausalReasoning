  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real frequency parameter. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential applications of \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) modify the trajectory, resulting in \\\\( z(T) = e^{aT}e^{(b-a)(T-t_1)}e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\). Both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) will affect the outcome along with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as each contributes to the overall exponential factor influencing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
