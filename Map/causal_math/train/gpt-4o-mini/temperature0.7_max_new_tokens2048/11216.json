  "Problem": "Consider a system in a complex plane characterized by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which must hold for a function \\\\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\\\) to be analytic in a region. Let \\\\( T \\\\) represent a transformation where \\\\( T(z) = z^2 \\\\) and explore this transformation's effect on the analytic properties of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to precisely reverse-engineer the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) based on the knowledge of the transformed and intervened output \\\\( f'(T(z)) = f(z^2) + cz^6 \\\\), knowing the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "While the form of the intervention \\\\( cz^6 \\\\) is known and the transformation \\\\( z^2 \\\\) is clear, the base function \\\\( f \\\\) itself might have multiple possible forms due to the arbitrary constants and the non-uniqueness in the roots when reversing \\\\( z^2 \\\\) (e.g., square roots yielding ± values).",
