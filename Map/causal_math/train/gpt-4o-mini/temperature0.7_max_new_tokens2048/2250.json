  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could have resulted from various initial conditions given the transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z_0 \\\\), altering the original path. Without confirming the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it’s impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) merely from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T.",
