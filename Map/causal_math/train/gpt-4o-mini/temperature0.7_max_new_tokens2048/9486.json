  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of the system. The effect of the integral transformation described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed with respect to its impact on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) had been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The potential application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) complicates backtracking to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as it entails an integration process influenced by \\\\( B \\\\), which impacts the trajectory in a non-trivial way, obscuring the original state.",

The transformation g(z) operates on z(t), but the specific impact on z(t) is unclear without knowing if g(z) was applied initially. Additionally, z(t) can influence the result of g(z) and may also provide information about the initial state z_0.",
