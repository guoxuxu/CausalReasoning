  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), on this function over the frequency domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and allowed to compute without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) solely depend on the input frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) relative to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\omega')\\\\). This shows that the transformed function directly depends on how \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) matches the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), without interference from other factors.",
