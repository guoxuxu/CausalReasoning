  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowing the system to evolve.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) from an evolved system with the PDE, can we determine whether a Fourier transform was applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without knowing the original \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the original condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\), the observed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) provides no additional information on whether a Fourier transform was applied initially. The linear nature of the system and the transform means any initial state, transformed or not, results in an end state that fits the natural evolution under the PDE.",
