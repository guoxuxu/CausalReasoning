  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system governed by a vector field \\\\(V(z) = i\\\\beta z\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant. The transformation considered is \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, and t represents time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(V(z)\\\\) without further intervention, will the final position \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) were evolved directly under \\\\(V(z)\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the trajectory by scaling the initial point. Since the vector field depends linearly on z, and \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) modifies the magnitude and potentially the phase of z, the trajectory will differ, affecting the final position at time T.",
