  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int K(x,y,t) u(y,t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\), the changes induced by the kernel function K in the integral transform make it impossible to uniquely recover \\\\( u_0(x,0) \\\\), especially if the kernel and operator L are not trivially related.",
