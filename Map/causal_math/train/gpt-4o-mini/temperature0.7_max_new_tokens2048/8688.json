  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( z(w) \\) observed at time T, can we determine if and when the intervention \\( e^{-bt} \\) was applied, just by analyzing \\( z(w) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The data from \\( z(w) \\) may show the overall effect of exponential decay, but it won't provide precise information about when the intervention started unless additional temporal data or markers of the intervention's onset are available. The interactions between different exponential terms over time make it complex to deduce the exact moment of intervention.",
