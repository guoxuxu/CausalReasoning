  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where x(t) and y(t) follow the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By(t) \\\\) respectively, with A and B being scalar constants. We examine the effect of applying the Laplace transform on these functions, denoted as \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is computed at t = 0 after Laplace transforming x and y separately, and then used to find the inverse Laplace to recover x(t) and y(t), will the recovered functions be the same as the original x(t) and y(t) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operation, and since the differential equations are linear and the initial conditions remain equivalent, the Laplace and inverse Laplace transform will accurately recover the original functions x(t) and y(t).",
