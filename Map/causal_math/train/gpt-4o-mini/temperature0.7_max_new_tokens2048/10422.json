  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\,dt\\\\) on this system.\n\nCan we deduce the exact values of \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) after observing the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s)\\\\), without knowing the original function form?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) dictate the form of the Laplace transform, specifically influencing the poles and magnitude. Given sufficient understanding of transform properties, these constants can be uniquely determined from the Laplace transform.",
