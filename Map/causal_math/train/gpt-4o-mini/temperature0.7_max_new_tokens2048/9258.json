  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine the changes introduced by performing a Laplace transformation on \\( z(t) \\), denoted as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial state \\( z_0 \\) purely by observing \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\) without knowing if it was transformed before or after the evolution according to \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "It’s challenging to reverse-engineer \\( z_0 \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\) without knowing the timing of the transformation, due to the fact that transforming before or after the solution impacts how \\( s \\) and \\( \\omega \\) relate and interplay in the transformed function.",
