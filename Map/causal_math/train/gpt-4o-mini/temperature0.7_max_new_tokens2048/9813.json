  "Problem": "Analyze the integral transformation \\\\( F(p) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(x) = cos(x) \\\\), where p represents a complex number. We study how changing the parameter p affects the transformation and the resulting function.\n\nWill the transformation output \\\\( F(p) \\\\) at \\\\( p = 1 + i \\\\) be substantially different from \\\\( p = 1 \\\\) without any additional manipulations of the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation depends on the parameter p, where a shift from a real to a complex value significantly alters the convergence and the behavior of the integral. The presence of the imaginary component modifies the decay rate of the exponential function, affecting the resultant integral.",
