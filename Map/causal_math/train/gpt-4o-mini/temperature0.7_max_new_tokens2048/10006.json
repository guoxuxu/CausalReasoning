  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent field described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax - By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's responses to transformations given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex scalar.\n\nCan we infer the original complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the exponential growth factor added by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could significantly modify the trajectory, obfuscating the original state.",
