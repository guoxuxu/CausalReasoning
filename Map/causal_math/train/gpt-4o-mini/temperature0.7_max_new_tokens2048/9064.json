  "Problem": "We analyze a heat equation \\(\\partial u/\\partial t = \\alpha \\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2\\) for a rod initially subject to a temperature distribution \\(u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) with \\(\\alpha > 0\\). Let's evaluate the effects of applying a Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine component.\n\nCan we determine whether \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) was applied at \\(t_1\\) based solely on observing \\(u(x, T)\\) where \\(T > t_1\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The nature of the heat equation and the Fourier sine transform may lead to similar temperature profiles at \\(T\\) resulting from different interventions at \\(t_1\\). Without additional information about intervening changes, it's not possible to uniquely determine the use of \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\).",
