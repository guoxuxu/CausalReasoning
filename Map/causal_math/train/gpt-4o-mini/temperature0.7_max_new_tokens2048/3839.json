  "Problem": "Evaluate the real part of the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a, b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(t\\\\) is the time variable. We explore an integral transformation by applying Laplace transform on this complex function.\n\nIf an additional phase shift by \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) degrees is introduced to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, does it depend only on the original constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a phase shift modifies the function to \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\), which changes the Laplace transform to \\\\(\\\\frac{e^{i\\\\phi}}{s-a-bi}\\\\). This transformation ensures that the result depends on the additional phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), not solely on \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).",
