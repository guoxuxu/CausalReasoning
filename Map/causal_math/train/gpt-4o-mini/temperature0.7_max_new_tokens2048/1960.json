  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time, representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. An integral transformation defined as \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number is applied.\n\nCan the presence of the intervention (\\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + ce^{Dt} \\\\)) at t = T/2 be precisely detected from final \\\\( w(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The final value \\\\( w(T) \\\\) integrates all changes, but different initial conditions and interventions can lead to similar end states due to overlapping effects of the exponential functions and diverse integration paths. Thus, based only on \\\\( w(T) \\\\), detangling the exact sequence and nature of interventions is infeasible.",
