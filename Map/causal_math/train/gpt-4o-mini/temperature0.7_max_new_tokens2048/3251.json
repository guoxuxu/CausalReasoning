  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nIf an intervention, defined by applying a filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(k)\\\\) in the frequency domain, is used at some t = t_1, will the final state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(T,x)]\\\\) for T > t_1 still mimic the unfiltered system's behavior?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new element, the filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(k)\\\\), which modifies the frequency components of the solution. This alteration affects the subsequent evolution, making the state at time T dependent on the nature of the filter applied, thus diverging from the trajectory of the original unfiltered system.",
