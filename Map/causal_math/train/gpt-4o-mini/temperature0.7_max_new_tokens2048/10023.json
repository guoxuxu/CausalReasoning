  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 5 \\\\). We deploy an operator transformation \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^z t dt \\\\) over the domain of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at some point \\\\( x_1 \\\\) to a new function \\\\( g(x) = x^4 - x + 1 \\\\) and we then apply \\\\( T \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( T(g(x)) \\\\) at any point depend solely on the transformed function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) altering its polynomial structure, which means the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) applied afterward is affected by the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) rather than \\\\( f(x) \\\\). However, if the intervention at \\\\( x_1 \\\\) influences the conditions or coefficients used in \\\\( g(x) \\\\) as related to initial conditions set by \\\\( f(x) \\\\), then the outcome still indirectly depends on both functions.",
