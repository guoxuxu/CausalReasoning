  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transformation applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) described as \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) dt \\\\). We analyze the impact of the modification where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by a squared modulus of another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), initiating as \\\\( g(t) = |h(t)|^2 f(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the resultant spectrum \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) after applying filters and transformations, can we determine which function and modifications were applied (\\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( alpha \\\\), or both), solely based on \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant spectrum \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) may not uniquely identify the exact interventions due to potential overlaps in spectral characteristics induced by different functions and filtering parameters. Identifying the precise modifications requires additional information beyond the spectrum itself.",
