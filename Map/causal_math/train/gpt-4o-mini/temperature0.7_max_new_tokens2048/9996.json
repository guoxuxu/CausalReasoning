  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant thermal diffusivity. An external heat source modifies this equation by a term \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\), making it \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + v(x,t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine precisely whether thermal diffusivity was changed from k to \\\\( k' \\\\) during the system's evolution by observing only the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution could potentially result from different configurations and changes in thermal diffusivity or source terms. Without additional information, we cannot uniquely determine whether and when an intervention on thermal diffusivity occurred.",
