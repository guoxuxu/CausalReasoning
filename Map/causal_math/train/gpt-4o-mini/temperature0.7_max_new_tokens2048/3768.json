  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the charge \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) on a capacitor evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{Q} = -\\\\frac{Q}{RC} + I(t) \\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is an external current source. We examine the impact of modifying the circuit by changing the resistance to a new value \\\\( R' \\\\) at time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( Q(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (the change in resistance, the current pulse parameters, or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( Q(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final charge \\\\( Q(T) \\\\) can result from different combinations of resistance value changes and different parameters of the current pulse. Without more detailed knowledge about timing or the nature of interventions, it is impossible to uniquely determine the interventions from \\\\( Q(T) \\\\) alone.",
