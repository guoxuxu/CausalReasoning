  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined as the convolution of two functions x and h on a real line, denoted as z(t) = (x * h)(t). This convolution operation represents the integral of the product of x shifted by -s and h, as function of s from negative to positive infinity. The analysis focuses on how differentiating z with respect to t, as well as considering the Fourier transform of x and h, impacts the resulting function.\n\nIf the function x is modified by multiplying it with a scalar function, say \\\\( exp(at) \\\\), does this modification change the Fourier transform of the convolution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as compared to that of the original z without this multiplication?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying x by \\\\( exp(at) \\\\) essentially results in shifting the Fourier transform of x along the frequency axis, which then alters the Fourier transform of the convolution product, changing z compared to the original scenario.",
