  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) passed through an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described by the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-(t-s)^2} \\\\), such that the transformed function is \\\\( Tz(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(t, s) z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nIf an intervention introduces a frequency shift by applying a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\Omega t} \\\\) midway during the transformation, will the final output \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\) reflect only the new frequency \\\\( \\Omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\Omega t} \\\\) introduced as an intervention modifies the existing state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and both frequencies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\Omega \\\\) could potentially influence the final transformed output due to the overlapping effects and the inherent properties of the Gaussian kernel, which does not selectively filter out specific frequencies cleanly.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is transformed by the integral transformation T, which is influenced by the kernel K(t, s), producing the transformed function Tz(s). An intervention introducing the function g(t) creates a frequency shift that influences Tz(s) and subsequently affects the final output. Thus, the original frequency ω contributes to Tz(s), while the new frequency Ω influences the final output.",
