  "Problem": "Consider a system subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse being applied under different scenarios. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes an oscillatory behavior \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is transformed using Laplace and then the inverse Laplace transform is applied without any alterations, will the recovered function be the same as \\\\( f(t) \\\\) for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are linear operations that precisely retrieve the original function if performed sequentially without alteration. Since the transforms are exact under the condition of linearity and the system is within the ROC, the original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is recovered exactly for all t.",
