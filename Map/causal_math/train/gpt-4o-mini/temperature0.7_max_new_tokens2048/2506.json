  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We study the influence of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) of the system.\n\nCan we retrieve the exact original initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from the state at time T, \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), if the initial condition was modified by a Fourier transform and no information about the transform is available?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge about the application of the Fourier transform obfuscates the original state. The evolution under the PDE further disperses any straightforward linkage between \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) and \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\\\) even more so due to the diffusive nature of the telegraph equation which blends and spreads initial characteristics.",
