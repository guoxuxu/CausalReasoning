  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform applied on a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We explore the causal implications of manipulating the function after its transform, by applying a frequency filter function \\\\( F(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the transformed and filtered function \\\\( H(s)F(s) \\\\), can one uniquely determine \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( a \\\\) in the filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) is critical to correctly back-transform the function to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) since the filtering process can equivalently be a result of different initial functions or different values of \\\\( a \\\\). Without this, the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) cannot be precisely recovered.",
