  "Problem": "Assume there is a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are complex numbers. This function is applied iteratively in the context of complex dynamics, commonly used in generating Julia sets.\n\nIf, during the iteration process at some step \\\\( n \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z_n \\\\) by a transformation \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants), will the final pattern of the sequence be independent of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory of the sequence. Depending on the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), this can significantly alter the final outcomes, potentially escaping to infinity or converging differently compared to the non-intervened sequence.",
