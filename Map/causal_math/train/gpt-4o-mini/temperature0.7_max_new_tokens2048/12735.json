  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a wave propagating in space and time. We analyze this system after performing a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) after various possible interventions (like filtering), can we determine precisely which intervention (or combination thereof) was applied, based solely on the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of different transformations in the frequency domain can overlap or mask each other, making it non-trivial and typically impossible to uniquely identify which interventions were applied, solely based on the outcome state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\).",
