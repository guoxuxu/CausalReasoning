  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the effects of transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by a function \\\\( j(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied, will the outcome state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 solely depend on the factor \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\) contribute additional scaling factors that affect the state's evolution. The final state depends on the interplay of the factors \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), influencing the rate of exponential growth or decay of the resultant state.",
