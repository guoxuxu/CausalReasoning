  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We're evaluating the effect of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}s ds \\\\) applied to a function z(t), where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely reconstructed from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T knowing that the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), being an integral involving exponential terms, significantly alters the vector fields influenced by the matrix D. The transformation's impact depends on both D and the integration process, obscuring the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) such that it cannot be precisely reconstructed just by observing the end state.",
