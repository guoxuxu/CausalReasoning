  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t that satisfy a coupled differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. We investigate how the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), impacts causal inference.\n\nIf the initial condition of the system is changed from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(0) \\\\), will the transformed system \\\\( Z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if originally evolved from \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the initial condition from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(0) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), leading to a different \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since the Fourier transform is linear but sensitive to input, \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) will capture these differences, especially given the dependency on A, B, C, and D.",
