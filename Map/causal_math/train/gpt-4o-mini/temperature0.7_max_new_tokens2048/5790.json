  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function z(t) measures the temperature at a point in space, evolving according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We consider the impact of a time-varying boundary condition applied as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) where B is a constant scalar.\n\nAfter observing z(T) at t = T, can we determine whether the initial condition was modified by the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) without observing z at intermediate times?",
  "Explanation": "Given z(T), different combinations of B and initial conditions could yield the same outcome due to the wide range of possible temperature distributions evolving under the heat equation. Without additional information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the usage or the parameter of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",
