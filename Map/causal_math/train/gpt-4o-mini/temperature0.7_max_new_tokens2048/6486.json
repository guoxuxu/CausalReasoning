  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature distribution over a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal conductivity. Study the effect of a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution, especially when analyzing the system's response to external heat sources.\n\nAfter observing the Fourier-transformed temperature distribution \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately trace back to determine \\\\( F(u(x,0)) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the evolution of temperature adheres strictly to the heat equation, and the transformation properties of the Fourier Transform under this differential operator are well-defined, it is entirely feasible to reconstruct \\\\( F(u(x,0)) \\\\) from \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) using the inverse operation and back-calculating based on the equation.",
