  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) in a two-dimensional space. We inquire about the impacts via transformations represented by \\\\( g(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) and subsequent linear transformations \\\\( h(x, y) = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the transformations used (both \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\)) by only observing the final value of \\\\( z \\\\) and knowing the original point \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same final value of \\\\( z \\\\) could potentially result from different transformation parameters due to the non-identification problem and the non-inversive nature of combining transformations like exponentials and matrix multiplications. Thus, it's impossible to uniquely identify the sequence or parameters of transformations just from the final value of \\\\( z \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The original points x_0 and y_0 directly influence the value of z through the function f(x, y). The transformation g(x, y) alters the values of x and y, which subsequently affects the value of z. The matrix A in the transformation h(x, y) also impacts the output z after the application of g.
