  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing a signal at time t. Assume that a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformed function is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](\\\\omega) \\\\), which offers a frequency domain representation of the signal.\n\nGiven the filtered output \\\\( \\\\Omega(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we accurately determine whether it was a result of applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), or both, solely based on observing \\\\( \\\\Omega(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the Fourier transformation and the subsequent application of a filter can significantly modify the frequency domain characteristics. Without explicit knowledge about the presence or specifics of the interventions, it's infeasible to uniquely determine the causal operations from the observed \\\\( \\\\Omega(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone due to the potential overlap and interaction effects of the transformations.",
