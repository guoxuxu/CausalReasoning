  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which is modeled by the Laplace Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)] = \\\\frac{1}{s-2} \\\\), to transfer into the frequency domain. We manipulate the function with an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(f)(s) = f(s+1) \\\\). We then explore the changes back in the time domain, represented by the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)] \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( T(\\\\frac{1}{s-2}) \\\\), and the resulting function is transformed back to the time domain without any additional changes, will this result in the same function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as initially?",
  "Explanation": "The application of operator \\\\( T \\\\) shifts the poles in the frequency domain, thus resulting in a function in the time domain that is distinct from the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Specifically, the inverse transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) yields \\\\( e^t \\\\), not the original \\\\( e^{2t} \\\\).",
