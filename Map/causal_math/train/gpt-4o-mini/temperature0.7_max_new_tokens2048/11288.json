  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We analyze the effect of complex conjugation on this function and any potential impacts on integral transformations of the resulting function over time t.\n\nGiven the final output from a Fourier transform at t = T, can we determine unambiguously whether the operation \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) at a specific point was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Frequency and phase characteristics at the output of a Fourier transform could result from various combinations of the initial function and mid-process interventions. Especially since complex exponentials can alter the phase significantly, it is impossible to backtrack uniquely and determine the exact interventions from the Fourier transform results.",
