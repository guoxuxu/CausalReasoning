  "Problem": "Considering a signal processing scenario where a continuous-time signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), and then a filter characterized by a function \\( H(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\).\n\nIf an additional filtering process described by \\( G(f) \\) is applied as an intervention before \\( H(f) \\), will the output \\( y(t) \\) be determined solely by the original filter \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new filter \\( G(f) \\) modifies the spectrum \\( X(f) \\) before \\( H(f) \\) is applied. The output \\( y(t) \\) therefore depends on both \\( G(f) \\) and \\( H(f) \\). The combined effect of these filters shapes the final signal, indicating dependence on both filters.",
