  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 accurately without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation brought by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) complicates the back-calculation, as the growth factors introduced by C are not determinable from A and B alone. The system’s reversibility is conditional on knowledge of all transformations applied.",
