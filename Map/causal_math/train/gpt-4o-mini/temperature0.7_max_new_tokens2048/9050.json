  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) represents a complex-valued function where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. This function is transformed by a complex exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by only observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\) affects both the amplitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), complicating back-calculation. Without knowing whether and how the transformation was applied, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the potential phase shift and scaling.",
