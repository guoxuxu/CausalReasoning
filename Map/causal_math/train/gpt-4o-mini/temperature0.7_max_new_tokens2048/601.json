  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined over the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{aw^2 + bw} dw \\\\) where a and b are constants. We are interested in the causal influence of changes in parameters a and b, or transformations on w, on the resulting function values computed by z.\n\nIf the parameter b is changed from b0 to b1 at time t = 0 and the function z is then evaluated without further modification to a or intervention in w, will the output of z(w) remain unaffected by the change in b?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the parameter b directly affects the exponent term in the integral defining z(w). Even a slight modification in b alters the rate of growth/decay within the integrand, and thereby the computed output of z(w) is invariably influenced.",
