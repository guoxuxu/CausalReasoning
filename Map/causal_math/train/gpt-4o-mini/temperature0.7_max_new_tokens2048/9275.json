  "Problem": "Imagine a system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time. We evaluate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at t = T_1 an intervention happens by applying a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex constant), will the state of the system at T > T_1 depend only on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at T_1 superimposes an additional complex exponential, thereby making the final state z(T) for T > T_1 dependent on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) as well as \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). This overlapping of transformations affects the solution trajectory and the system's final state.",

The transformation f(z) modifies z(t) through the factor e^(αt), impacting the state of the system.
