  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effects of applying Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as well as its inverse and interactions due to various potential modifications.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), can the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) be uniquely determined without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), when correctly obtained and under the right conditions (assuming all prerequisites of Laplace Transform such as region of convergence are met), can uniquely recover \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). This deductive recovery is a direct feature of the inverse transformation process.",
