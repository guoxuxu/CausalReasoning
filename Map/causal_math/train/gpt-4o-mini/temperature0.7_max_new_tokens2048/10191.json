  "Problem": "Investigate a control system where the growth rate of a population \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\), with r being a growth constant. An intervention is performed using a function \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), where k is another constant, to modify the instantaneous growth rate at a specific time point.\n\nIf an intervention with \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\) is applied at t = t1, will the resulting population at t = T solely depend on the initial rate r and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the growth equation and, subsequently, the trajectory of the population. The new growth characteristics and final population size at t = T are influenced by the parameter k in addition to the original growth constant r.",
