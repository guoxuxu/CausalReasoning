  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by \\( Ax = b \\), where A is a non-singular matrix. An operator \\( T \\) defined by \\( T(x) = Ux \\) (where \\( U \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied, modifying the vector \\( x \\) in the space.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( x(T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) knowing that \\( T(x) \\) was applied, without additional details about \\( U \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the nature of the matrix \\( U \\), reconstructing the original \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) is not feasible directly as the operation \\( Ux_0 \\) cannot be uniquely inverted without knowing \\( U \\).",
