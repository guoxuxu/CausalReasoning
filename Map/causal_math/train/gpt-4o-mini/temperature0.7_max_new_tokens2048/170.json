  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{Y(s)}{s - P} \\\\), where \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of the output variable y(t) and P is a constant pole. An input function is defined as \\\\( u(t) = e^{Dt} \\\\) where D is a constant. The system's response is altered by applying the Laplace transform of the input.\n\nObserving the response \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at some time t, can we identify the original system pole \\\\( P \\\\) without knowing that \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) has been applied and its dynamics \\\\( D \\\\), it can be impossible to uniquely determine the original system characteristic \\\\( P \\\\), as the output would be a convolution influenced by D as well.",
