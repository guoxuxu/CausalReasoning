  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system where the input-output relationship is governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\), with \\( x(t) \\) representing the system state at time \\( t \\) and \\( A \\) a complex constant matrix. We analyze the effect of transforming the system state via a function \\( g(x) = D x \\), where \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\( z(T) = e^{TA}x(T) \\) for some \\( T \\), can we ascertain the initial condition \\( x(0) \\) without knowing whether it was transformed by \\( g(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exact effect of \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) on \\( x(0) \\) influences the system's trajectory in such a way that knowing just \\( z(T) \\) provides insufficient information to uniquely recover \\( x(0) \\) without additional data about the application or non-application of \\( g(x) \\).",
