  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The influence of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, is analyzed over time. This transformation modifies the trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information on the constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) or baseline measurements at t = 0, it is impossible to uniquely determine if the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied. The effect of \\\\( b \\\\) could potentially be mimicked by different starting phases or frequencies in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
