  "Problem": "We consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Mz \\\\), with M being a complex matrix. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another complex matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied throughout the evolution, just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying interventions based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is impractical due to the possible equivalence of several trajectories leading to the same endpoint. The interactions between the exponential impacts of N and L with M, and their sequence of applications, create a myriad of potential pathways that complicate backward determination of the interventions.",
