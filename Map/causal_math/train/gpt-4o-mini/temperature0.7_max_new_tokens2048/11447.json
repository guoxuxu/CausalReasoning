  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nIf an intervention using another mapping function \\\\( h(x) = e^{i\\\\phi}x \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the oscillator's position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), ignoring \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations, \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\), impact the phase of the oscillator, thus affecting the trajectory and ultimately the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The final position depends on the compounded effects of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) along with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The mapping function g(x) applies a phase rotation to the oscillator's position, resulting in a new position x'. The intervention h(x) also modifies the position to x', which further influences the oscillator's position x(T) at a later time. Ultimately, the position x(T) is determined by the oscillator's frequency ω, with the phase rotations from g(x) and h(x) having no direct effect.",
