  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) applied in a calculus context on a closed contour \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of various transformations and integrations of the function over the contour.\n\nIf the function is modified by an intervention where \\\\( g(z) = e^{2z} \\\\) is applied mid-calculation, does the end result of the integral over \\\\( C \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function introduced by the intervention, \\\\( g(z) = e^{2z} \\\\), changes the nature of the integral calculations. This intervention alters the integrand throughout the contour, influencing the final integral result and making it dependent not only on the original function but also on the new function applied.",
