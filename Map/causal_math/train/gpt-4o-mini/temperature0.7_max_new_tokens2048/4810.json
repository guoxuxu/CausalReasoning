  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function's behavior when subjected to Laplace Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and its transformation into the Laplace domain, defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the implications of altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and its effects on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) with a specific pole location in the Laplace domain, can we precisely infer the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) directly indicates the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), the imaginary part of the pole position directly gives the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), allowing a straightforward back-calculation.",
