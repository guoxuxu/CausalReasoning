  "Problem": "A continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the complex plane follows the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. Let us consider the influence of a transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nSeeing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has evolved for time T, can we accurately deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirming the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), any attempt to trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can be incorrect, as \\\\( z(T) \\\\) includes potential scaling by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), influencing the magnitude in addition to the rotation caused by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), making the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) indeterminate from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
