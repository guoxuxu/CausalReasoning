  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2} h(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given real function. We evaluate scenarios where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is modified by transformations such as \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(h) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) initially, then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is computed via the integral transform without further changes to function \\\\( h(s) \\\\), will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( h(s) \\\\) was used directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\) alters the integrand in the integral transform, thereby changing the resulting function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The addition of \\\\( s^3 \\\\) to \\\\( h(s) \\\\) will contribute to the integral value differently, leading to a different function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) than what would emerge using unmodified \\\\( h(s) \\\\).",
