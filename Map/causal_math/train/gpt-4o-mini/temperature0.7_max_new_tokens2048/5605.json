  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform, which transforms the function into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally without intervention, and then a Laplace transform is applied, will the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) accurately represent the frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform inherently captures the frequency components of the signal through its transformation mechanism. Therefore, by analyzing \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), the constant frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the original function is clearly represented and can be accurately determined.",
