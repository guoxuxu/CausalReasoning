  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\phi & -\\sin \\phi \\\\ \\sin \\phi & \\cos \\phi \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) representing a rotation by an angle \\\\( \\phi \\\\) on the complex plane.\n\nBased on the final observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which rotations (either \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\) or both) were applied at earlier times?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of rotations by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) can result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the properties of circular symmetry and commutativity in rotations. Without additional information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the specific sequences or angles of rotations used.",
