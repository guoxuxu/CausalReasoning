  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow system governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional region. Suppose the velocity field is represented as \\\\( \\\\vec{u} = (u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t)) \\\\) and governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. An external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} = (f_x(x,y,t), f_y(x,y,t)) \\\\) can be controlled as an intervention.\n\nIf the initial conditions for \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) are given without any external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} \\\\), will the velocity field at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be solely dependent on the viscosity \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) and initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of external forces, the evolution of the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations influenced only by the initial conditions and the fluid’s properties, mainly the viscosity \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\). Thus, the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) will strictly depend on these factors.",
