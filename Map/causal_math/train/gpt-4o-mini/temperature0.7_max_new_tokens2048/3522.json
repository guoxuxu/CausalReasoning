  "Problem": "A system is controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We assess the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nStarting from the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be accurately determined at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "If it is unknown whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the alterations caused by the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) make it impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Depending on D's properties relative to M, the initial state could have been various possible vectors.",
