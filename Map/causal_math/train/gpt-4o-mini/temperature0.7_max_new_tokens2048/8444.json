  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) describes a rotation with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We explore the response of the system when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to a transformation using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven only the ending state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowledge that interventions might have occurred, can we determine exactly whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), or both were applied, along with their parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The final point \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be the result of various combinations of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\) with differing parameters. The overlapping effects of complex transformations hinder the definitive identification of which, if any, transformations were applied, as well as the precise values of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( d \\\\).",
