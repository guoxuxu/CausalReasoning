  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\). We explore the behavior of this transformation under different conditions and study the causal inference between the input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and its transformed counterpart \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is a zero function for all t, i.e., \\\\(f(t) = 0\\\\), will \\\\(F(s)\\\\) be zero for all s?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the zero function is always zero, as there are no values to transform across the integral from 0 to infinity. Therefore, \\\\(F(s)\\\\) will remain zero across all values of s.",
