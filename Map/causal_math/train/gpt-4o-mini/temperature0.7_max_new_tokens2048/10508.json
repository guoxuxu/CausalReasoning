  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant frequency. To analyze this, a transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\phi(z) =  \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t)z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is also a real constant, is applied at various times.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( \\\\phi(z) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\psi(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from a variety of phase manipulations due to the additive effects of the transformations \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\exp(-i\\\\theta t) \\\\). Different sequences or amounts of phase shifts could yield the same final state, making it challenging to determine the specific interventions used.",
