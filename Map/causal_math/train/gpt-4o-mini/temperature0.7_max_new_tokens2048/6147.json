  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation under the action of a linear operator defined by \\\\( L[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw \\), where the operation is along a path in the complex plane.\n\nIf at a certain point along the path, the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( g(z) = cz^2 \\\\) by multiplying with a complex number c, will the endpoint value \\\\( L[g](z) \\\\) depend only on the original transformation \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the intervention with c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with multiplying by c changes the function itself, thus directly impacting the integral computed by \\\\( L \\\\). Since \\\\( L \\\\) calculates the integral over the modified function \\\\( cz^2 \\\\) from 0 to z, the final value \\\\( L[g](z) \\\\) will be different and dependent on the value of c, reflecting the influence of the intervention.",
