  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to study its behavior over time.\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T could either be a result of natural evolution from an unknown altered initial condition \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t_0}z_0 \\\\) or the direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The ambiguity arises due to the unknown application of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine the initial state.",
