  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, transformed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAt} z \\\\) over time t, where A is a real constant. This represents a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nCan the specific interventions (values of A and B) be uniquely determined from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone, after applying the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) initially and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = K?",
  "Explanation": "Different pairs of A and B can result in the same final state due to the rotational nature of the transformations. For example, an initially larger A rotation could be compensated by a larger opposite B rotation at t = K, making it impossible to uniquely determine both A and B from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
