  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nIf \\(z(t) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\) is transformed at \\(t = 0\\) and then evolved under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) without any further intervention, will \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > 0\\) still mimic the dynamics of \\(z(t) = e^{Ct}z_0\\) in the original, untransformed system?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\) significantly changes the frequency components of the initial vector \\(z_0\\). When evolved under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), the altered frequency components will result in different dynamics, leading to a system state at \\(T\\) that differs fundamentally from \\(e^{Ct}z_0\\).",
