  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over time t, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number. We are interested in the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds\\\\) applied to z.\n\nCan we deduce the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over an interval [0, T], given the output of the transformation \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) gives us a cumulative integral value. This information encapsulates more than just the state at a specific time and includes no direct inference about the specific path of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) taken to arrive at this integral, especially without knowing the exact form and parameters (\\omega) of z(t).",
