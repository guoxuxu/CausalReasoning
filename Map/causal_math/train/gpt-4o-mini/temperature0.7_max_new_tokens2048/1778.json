  "Problem": "Consider a vector field expressed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. Analyze the effect when a Möbius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\) is applied to z, where a, b, c, d are complex constants.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex variable \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the Möbius transformation was applied without our knowledge, it obscures the original starting state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Since the transformation affects the state non-linearly, recovering the exact initial state without knowing the parameters a, b, c, d of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is not feasible.",
