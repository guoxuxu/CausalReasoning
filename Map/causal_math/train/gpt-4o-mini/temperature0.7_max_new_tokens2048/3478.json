  "Problem": "Consider a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) that is governed by the Schrodinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). An integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = \\\\int h(x) \\\\psi(x,t) dx \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a fixed function.\n\nCan the original wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) be exactly deduced at t = 0 after observing the transformed wave function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at any future time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) is an integral that may involve loss of information (not necessarily invertible), and the wave function evolves according to the Schrodinger equation, it is generally not possible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) from \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at a later time t = T.",
