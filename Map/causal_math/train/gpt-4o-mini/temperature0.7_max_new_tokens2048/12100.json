  "Problem": "Investigate a complex dynamical system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by the input \\( x(t) \\) according to a Laplace transform relationship \\( Z(s) = X(s)/s \\). Here, \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Z(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( z(t) \\) respectively, with \\( s \\) being a complex variable.\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) = e^{-t} \\\\) is used as input at t = 0 and evolves naturally, will the resultant \\\\( z(t) \\\\) strictly be \\\\( 1 - e^{-t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the system equation, the output \\( z(t) \\) for an exponential decay input is \\( 1 - e^{-t} \\), derived from taking the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\), which indeed results in \\( 1 - e^{-t} \\). Thus, without intervention, the output follows precisely from the mathematical model.",
