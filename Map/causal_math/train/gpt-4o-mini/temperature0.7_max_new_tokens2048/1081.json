  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\. Over time, the function describes a circular trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governs the behavior of the complex number \\\\( x \\\\) over time, and there is no external intervention, will the magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remain constant over time?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) represents a rotation in the complex plane, the magnitude of \\\\( x \\\\) remains unchanged. The transformation \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) only affects the angle of \\\\( x \\\\) by rotating it, and does not change its magnitude.",
