  "Problem": "A system is defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves over time according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the system's behavior under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB(t-s)}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\) where B is another real constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it is difficult to reconstruct \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) since the transformation involves integration which may have compounded effects due to the function \\\\( e^{iB(t-s)} \\\\), obscuring the original function's information.",
