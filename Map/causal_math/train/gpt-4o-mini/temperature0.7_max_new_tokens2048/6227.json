  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of an electrical circuit where the input voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is transformed through a Laplace Transform to produce \\\\( V(s) \\\\). The system is defined by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the circuit's response is calculated using the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot V(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a feedback loop characterized by another transfer function \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s+2} \\\\) is introduced into the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the output \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the feedback loop changes the overall system dynamics, incorporating \\\\( G(s) \\\\) into the analysis. Therefore, the output \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depends on both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the added \\\\( G(s) \\\\), affecting the ultimate response.",
