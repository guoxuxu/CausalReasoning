  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving as per the dynamical system given by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling and rotating \\\\( z_0 \\\\), resulting in an altered trajectory. The effect of \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) is not just a shift but a transformation that changes the dynamics of the system, leading to a different state at t = T.",
