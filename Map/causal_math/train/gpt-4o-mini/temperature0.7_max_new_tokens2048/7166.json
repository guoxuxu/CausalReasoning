  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real variables. This function is subjected to a Laplace Transformation over the variable \\\\( t \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency domain variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z(x, 0) \\\\) without knowledge of time evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform clearly delineates the time-independent component \\\\( e^{ax} \\\\), which is the exponent at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). Thus, knowing the transformed function allows reversing to the initial state \\\\( z(x, 0) = e^{ax} \\\\).",
