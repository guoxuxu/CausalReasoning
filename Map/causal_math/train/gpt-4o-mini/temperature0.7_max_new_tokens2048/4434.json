  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Evaluate the change in the function through an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a different complex number.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely recover \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Because the transformation aggregates influences over the interval from 0 to T and is dependent on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it obscures the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge that \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modified the function, \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely inferred from \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\).",
