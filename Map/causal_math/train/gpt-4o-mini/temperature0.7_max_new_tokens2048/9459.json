  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. We explore the effects of the linear operator transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\tau e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over different time spans \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf a new constant \\\\( k \\\\) is introduced modifying the equation to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (i\\\\omega + k) z + \\\\lambda \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 < \\\\tau \\\\), will the modified equation's output to \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\) depend only on the new parameters and not on the original parameters (\\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( k \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). However, since the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) both influence the result by \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the outcome depends on both the old (\\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)) and new parameters (\\\\( k \\\\)), affecting the overall trajectory and thus the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
