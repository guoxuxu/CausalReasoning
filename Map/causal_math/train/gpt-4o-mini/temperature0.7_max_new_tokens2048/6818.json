  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which converts the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) into its frequency components \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) was applied during evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether a transformation occurred, the exact initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) that led to \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) is ambiguous. The transformation could alter the frequencies and phase of the solution, making it impossible to retrieve the original function unambiguously.",
