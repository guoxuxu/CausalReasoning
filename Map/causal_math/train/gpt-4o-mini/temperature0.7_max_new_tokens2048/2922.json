  "Problem": "Assume we are analyzing a thermal system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = \\\\Delta u + c u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature distribution in a medium, \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\(c\\\\) is a heat source term. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\nAfter observing the transformed temperature profile \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at t = T, is it possible to deduce the initial transformed state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_0)(\\\\xi)\\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was consistently applied in transforming the solution of the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information on the consistent application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) throughout the solution process of the PDE, the original frequency components in \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_0)(\\\\xi)\\\\) cannot be distinctly reconstructed. This is due to potential alterations in phase and amplitude during the evolution which aren't tracked or reversed simply by observing the end state in the frequency domain.",
