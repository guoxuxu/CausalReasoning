  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nGiven the output at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we precisely determine whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both were applied during the evolution from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), using only the knowledge of the output state?",
  "Explanation": "Depending on the nature of the transformations and their time of application, different sequences of interventions could lead to the same final state due to the complex interactions and the properties of exponential and polynomial transformations applied on the complex plane. This ambiguity prevents the precise identification of which transformations were used and when.",
