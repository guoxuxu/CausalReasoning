  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. This transformation applies to a signal analysis context where the function represents a wave. Suppose we apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) at some point.\n\nGiven the spectrum obtained from the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at an arbitrary time T, can we infer the exact form of \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a simple harmonic function, the Fourier transform will consistently reveal the same frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), independent of the time at which it is measured. The spectral content precisely indicates the frequency defining \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\).",
