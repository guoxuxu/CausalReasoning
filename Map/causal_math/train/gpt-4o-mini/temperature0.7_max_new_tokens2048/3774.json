  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), can we determine if the transform \\\\( G(k) \\\\) was applied at the initial time t = 0 with absolute certainty, knowing only \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) but not \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it's impossible to determine if the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) \\\\) was applied, as it could merely be part of the natural evolution of the system under the given differential equation, especially if transformations yielding a similar decay in terms of k due to conditions at time t = 0 could be misconstrued as the effect of \\\\( G(k) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function U(x, t) leads to the second spatial derivative U_{xx}, which is caused by the negative product of the constant λ and U. The function U(x, t) transforms into the function ˆU(k, t) through a Fourier transform. The transformed function ˆU(k, t) is influenced by the spatial transform G(k), which is defined as e^{-αk^2 t}. The constant λ relates to G(k), indicating a connection between the spatial behavior described by λ and the effects of G(k).",
