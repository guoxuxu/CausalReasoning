  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation under the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F \\\\). The Fourier Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) showing a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\), can it be deduced that the original function was modified by a phase shift without knowing what intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The shift in the peak of the spectrum from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\) is indicative of a phase shift intervention. The nature of Fourier Transform in representing frequency changes as shifts in the spectrum allows for deducing the specific type of intervention (a phase shift).",
