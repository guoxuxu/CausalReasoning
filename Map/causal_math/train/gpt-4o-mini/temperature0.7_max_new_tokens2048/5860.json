  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) applied as a transformation on a time-dependent signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), producing a new signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\). Where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. This scenario explores the relation and transformation effect with and without interventions such as changing the frequency or applying a damping factor.\n\nKnowing only \\\\(y(T)\\\\) following the interventions including the complex function and damping factor, can we infer all properties (initial signal \\\\(x(0)\\\\), frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), and damping factor \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\))? ",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(y(T)\\\\) is influenced by multiple factors including initial conditions, frequency, and damping, creating a complex interaction that obscures direct retrieval of any single aspect. Without additional data points or constraints, uniquely determining \\\\(x(0)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) from \\\\(y(T)\\\\) alone is not feasible.",
