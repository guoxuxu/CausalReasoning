  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nIf the mapping function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves according to its natural law \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), will the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to T without the mapping?",
  "Explanation": "The mapping function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) modifies the initial phase of the oscillator, which affects its trajectory. Since phase is critical in determining the exact position of a harmonic oscillator, the resulting position will differ.",
