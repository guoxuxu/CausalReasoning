  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}x \\\\), where U is a matrix that diagonalizes D (i.e., \\\\( UDU^{-1} = D' \\\\) is a diagonal matrix).\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, without specific knowledge of whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was indeed applied but not accounted for, we might mistakenly assume the initial condition was \\\\( x_0 \\\\) instead of \\\\( U^{-1}x_0 \\\\). Thus, without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely determine the initial state.",
