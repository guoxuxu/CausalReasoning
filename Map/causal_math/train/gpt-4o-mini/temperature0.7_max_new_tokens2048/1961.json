  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a linear time-invariant differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) operating on a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and consider the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[u(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\). Assume \\\\( L[u(t)] = -u''(t) + 3u'(t) - 2u(t) \\\\), and study the Laplace transform effects.\n\nIf \\\\( T[u(t)] \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the result is then processed with the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\), without any additional transformation, will the sequence \\\\( L[T[u(t)]] \\\\) equal to \\\\( T[L[u(t)]] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operator, which commutes with linear differential operators whose coefficients do not depend on the variable of transformation (time in this case). Thus, applying \\\\( L \\\\) after \\\\( T \\\\) yields the same result as first applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and then transforming the result.",
