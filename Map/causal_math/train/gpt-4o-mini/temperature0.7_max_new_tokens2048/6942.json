  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is subjected to an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\), evaluating the Laplace transform of the function.\n\nAfter observing the Laplace transform \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T, can we unequivocally determine the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) masks the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) through interaction with \\\\( s \\), making it infeasible to accurately deduce \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without specific knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\). The transform alters the frequency characteristics embedded in the original function.",
