  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a transformation, defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T if it is unknown whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied or the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), since the transformation could have altered both magnitude and phase of the original value in non-trivial ways.",
