  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified by adding a constant real value \\\\( a \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve naturally, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) at any given \\\\( \\omega \\\\) be equivalent to adding \\\\( a \\\\delta(\\omega) \\\\) to the original \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a constant \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) translates to adding a \\\\( a \\\\cdot \\delta(\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain, due to the Fourier transform properties. This perturbation translates linearly through the transform.",
