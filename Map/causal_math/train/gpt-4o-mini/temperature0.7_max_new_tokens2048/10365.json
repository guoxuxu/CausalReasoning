  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under a linear transformation described by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) applied on the vector representation \\\\( (x, y) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(u) du \\) is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf the initial complex function \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve under its transformation for a time period T without further intervention, will \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\) be independent of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) affects its trajectory, thus altering the outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\. Since \\\\( T[z] \\\\) includes an integration dependent on the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T (influenced by \\\\( A \\\\)), it is not independent of \\\\( A \\\\).",
