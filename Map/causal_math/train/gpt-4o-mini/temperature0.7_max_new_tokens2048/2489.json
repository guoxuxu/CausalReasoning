  "Problem": "Consider a nondeterministic control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves over time according to a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) representing the differential of a Wiener process. We investigate how applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}z \\\\) affects the path of the system, where S is a constant, invertible matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed only by the evolution dictated by the equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to the path had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) been evolved directly under the given stochastic differential equation without the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( S^{-1}z_0 \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which affects the trajectory of the system. The stochastic components further contribute to a unique path due to initial state variations and random perturbations from the Wiener process.",
