  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt \\\\), a Laplace transform operating on a function w(t). We explore changes induced by modifying w(t) either through a polynomial scaling \\\\( p(t) = t^n \\\\) or an exponential modifier \\\\( q(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nIf the function w(t) is modified by p(t) to form a new function w'(t) = t^n w(t) and transformed using z(w'), will z(w') be the same as z(w) scaled by a factor dependent only on n?",
  "Explanation": "The polynomial scaling of w(t) by p(t) not only alters the growth rate of w(t) but also affects how w(t) decays and interacts with the exponential e^{-st} in the Laplace transform. This interaction changes the poles of the transform and therefore z(w') won't simply be z(w) scaled by a factor of n; it results in a fundamentally different transform.",
