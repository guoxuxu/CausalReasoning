  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function represents a signal in the complex plane, oscillating with time. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function to analyze its spectral properties.\n\nIf a phase shift transformation, defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t + \\phi} \\\\) where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is a constant phase, is applied before computing the Fourier transform, will the spectrum still show a single frequency at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without shifts?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\) in the time domain translates into a modified phase in the frequency domain without altering the location of the frequency component. Thus, the spectrum will still show a peak at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), confirming the frequency component remains unchanged, only the phase is affected.",
