  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A transformation is applied to this system through the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), compounding the complex state with exponential growth factors from \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). This alteration leads to a different trajectory and final state at time T than if evolving directly without the transformation.",
