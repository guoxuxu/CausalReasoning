  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is the solution to the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\), and K is a constant matrix. Explore the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(w) = e^{Dt}w \\\\) at various times, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(w) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by the system's evolution according to \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was evolved to time T under \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(w) \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial conditions due to the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). This transformation modifies the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) even before considering its complex enveloping through \\\\( e^{it} \\\\. Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ because the trajectories of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) have been altered.",
