  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number and the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to this function. The Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), can we determine the value of \\\\( w \\\\) unequivocally without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-iw} \\\\), determining \\\\( w \\\\) is direct as it appears as a parameter in the denominator uniquely defining its value.",
