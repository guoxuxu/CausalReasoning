  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), where \\( \\\\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z \\) represents a complex function. Investigating the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\( a \\) is a real constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can we ascertain the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowledge if transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of knowledge about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at the start complicates back-tracing the evolution. Since \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) can alter the magnitude of the initial condition, this unknown scaling factor renders it impossible to uniquely deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
