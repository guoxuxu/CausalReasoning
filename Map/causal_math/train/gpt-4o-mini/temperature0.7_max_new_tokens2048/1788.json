  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in the domain describing a physical system. The transformation is defined by an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( v(x) = (T u)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} U(x, y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\), and aware of an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine what transformations (\\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) were applied, just by analyzing \\\\( v(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of different kernel functions and the potentially similar results they can produce under the operator \\\\( A \\\\), it is challenging to precisely attribute the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) to specific transformations. The interactions between the kernels and the operator may yield indistinguishable outcomes, making accurate backward inference difficult.",
