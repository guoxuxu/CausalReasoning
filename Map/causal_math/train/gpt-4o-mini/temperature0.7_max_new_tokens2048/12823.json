  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the frequency domain, is it possible to conclusively determine whether any interventions like \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) were applied, merely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations into the frequency domain, particularly when combined or applied sequentially (and considering non-linear transformations like squaring the frequency), create complex interactions that embed and overlap various transformations' effects. These interactions usually prevent a clear and unambiguous identification of which transformations or interventions were indeed used.",
