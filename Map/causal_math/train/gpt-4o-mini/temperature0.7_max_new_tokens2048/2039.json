  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) represents the Laplacian operator. We are interested in the effect of applyingt the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\), which transforms the function into the Fourier space, on the causal inference in the system.\n\nAssuming at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) not be affected by the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the inverse Fourier transform at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) effectively brings the function back to its spatial representation, which then continues to evolve according to the spatial PDE. The intervention does not alter the evolution but dictates in which space (Fourier or spatial) the evolution continues.",
