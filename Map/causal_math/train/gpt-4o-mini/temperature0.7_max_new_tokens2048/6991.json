  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\) governing the temperature field \\( u \\) over a domain, affected by an external heat source modulated by the function \\( h(t, x) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\sin(\\omega x) \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\omega \\) are constants.\n\nIf an intervention replaces \\( h(t, x) \\) with another heat source \\( k(t, x) = e^{-\\mu t} \\cos(\\theta x) \\) starting from some time \\( t_1 \\), will the temperature profile \\( u(x, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be determined solely by the original properties of the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( k(t, x) \\) constitutes an adjustment in the boundary condition of the heat equation, influencing the evolution of the temperature field from \\( t_1 \\) onwards. Both the nature of the new source \\( k(t, x) \\) and its difference from \\( h(t, x) \\) will impact the resulting temperature distribution at any time \\( T > t_1 \\), thus making it dependent on both the initial state and the intervening modifications.",
