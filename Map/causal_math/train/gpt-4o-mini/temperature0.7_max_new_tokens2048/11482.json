  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined in a closed path in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are differentiable functions of t. The transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Tz = z^2 \\\\), applied to the path of z.\n\nCan the original complex path \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the transformed path at t = T if we know the path has been subjected to \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While knowing the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) helps, many different paths could potentially yield the same transformed path due to the nature of complex square functions, where both positive and negative roots are possible for each point on the resultant path.",
