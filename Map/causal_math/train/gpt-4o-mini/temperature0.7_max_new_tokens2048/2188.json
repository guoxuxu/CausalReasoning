  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( L\\{y(t)\\} = Y(s) \\), where \\( y(t) \\) is a function in the time domain and \\( Y(s) \\) is its corresponding representation in the complex frequency domain. Assume an initial condition \\( y(0) = y_0 \\) and study the effects of an impulse response \\( h(t) \\) applied to this system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( H(s) \\).\n\nGiven the final output \\( M(s)Y(s)H(s) \\), and knowing the form of \\( M(s) \\), is it possible to deduce both \\( Y(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\) distinctly and accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Though the function \\( M(s) \\) is known, \\( M(s)Y(s)H(s) \\) does not allow for the separation of \\( Y(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\) unless additional information about one of the components is given. The multiplication in the frequency domain melds the characteristics of both functions into a single entity, barring unique decomposition.",
