  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is different from \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the final transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) be affected solely by the new \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not by the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) will reflect both the impact of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the new \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). The transformation accumulates contributions from both intervals: from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T governed by \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Thus, it is dependent on both values.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) influences the transformation T(z)(t), while the frequency ω affects the function z(t). A change in frequency from ω to ω' leads to a new function z'(t), which subsequently influences the transformation T(z)(T). Thus, T(z)(T) is affected by the new frequency ω' rather than the original frequency ω.",
