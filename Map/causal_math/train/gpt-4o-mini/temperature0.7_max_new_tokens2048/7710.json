  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing system where a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) modulates an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) according to the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\). \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then analyzed at various time points t using a Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the observed Fourier spectrum \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t = T \\\\), is it possible to exactly infer the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the impulse response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), reconstructing the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from its transformed output \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) is ambiguous. The convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) fundamentally alters the signal in a way that can't be uniquely reversed without additional information about \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
