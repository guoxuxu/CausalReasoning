  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The function's evolution is governed by the linear differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Pz \\), where \\( P \\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Qt}z(\\tau) d\\tau \\), where \\( Q \\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( I(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the integral transformation \\( I(z) \\) was applied, it is impossible to backtrack the development of \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z_0 \\) uniquely because the integral transformation could fundamentally change the trajectory from its natural exponential path determined by \\( P \\).",
