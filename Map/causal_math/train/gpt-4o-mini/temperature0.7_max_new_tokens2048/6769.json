  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 by multiplying by a scalar factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), and then allowed to evolve naturally without further intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) at any frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remain unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the entire function by scaling its amplitude. This change affects the Fourier transform, which now integrates over a scaled function, resulting in an overall multiplied Fourier transform by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\). Thus, the transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) is also scaled by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\).",
