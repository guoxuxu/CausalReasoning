  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the influence of the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the resulting function is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the time evolution of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any later time \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to if the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a delta function centered at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and the evolution \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\) will maintain the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Hence the Fourier transform remains unaltered over time.",
