  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a time-varying admittance matrix \\\\( Y(t) \\\\), and a network described by the voltage-current relationship \\\\( I = Y(t)V \\\\). We examine the impact of a transformation represented by the matrix function \\\\( P(t) = e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, that affects the voltage vector over time.\n\nGiven the current vector \\\\( I(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial voltage vector \\\\( V_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to reconstruct the initial \\( V_0 \\) uniquely because the transformation could have modified \\( V_0 \\) by an exponential factor (e.g., scaling, rotating), which directly affects the resultant \\( I(T) \\).",
