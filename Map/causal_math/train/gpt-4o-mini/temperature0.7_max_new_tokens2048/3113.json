  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{ct}z_0\\\\) applied on initial complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. The system is further governed by another complex function \\\\(w(z) = e^{dz}w_0\\\\), where \\\\(d\\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\(w_0\\\\) is the initial state of another dependent complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) on \\\\(z_0\\\\) and then \\\\(w(z)\\\\) is allowed to evolve from \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\(w(z(t))\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(w_0\\\\) was evolved from \\\\(z_0\\\\) directly under \\\\(w(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\(z(t) = e^{ct}z_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t\\\\) changes the input to the function \\\\(w(z)\\\\), altering how \\\\(w(z)\\\\) will evolve. Therefore, \\\\(e^{dz(t)} = e^{d(e^{ct}z_0)}\\\\) produces a different result from \\\\(e^{dz_0}\\\\) over time, making the outcome at time \\\\(T\\\\) different.",
