  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a real variable y depends on x through the relation \\(y = x^2 + 2x + 1\\). We study the transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) and examine its impact on y, in the context of solving the related differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 2 \\).\n\nIf g(x) is applied to x at x = 2, resulting in \\( x' = 3 \\), and we then evaluate y without further intervention, will \\( y(x') \\) at \\( x' = 3 \\) be the same as if x was increased to 3 in \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\) without applying g(x)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) simply translates x by 1, and \\( y(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\) evaluated at \\( x = 3 \\) yields the same result regardless of whether x was directly set to 3 or transformed by g(x). Hence, y behaves predictively under direct substitution or through transformation.",
