  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. The function describes the combined influence of two transformations on initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention with new vectors \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) is applied, replacing \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\), will the state at \\\\( T \\\\) be solely dependent on the values of \\\\( u \\\\), \\\\( v \\\\), and initial matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the intervention replaces the initial vectors with \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\), the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any time after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is uniquely determined by how these new vectors evolve under the influence of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), specifically through \\\\( e^{AT}u \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}v \\\\).",
