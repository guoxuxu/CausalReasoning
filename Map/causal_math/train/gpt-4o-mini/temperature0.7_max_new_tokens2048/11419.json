  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nIf after initial convolution with \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\), another convolution with a different Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma') \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final Fourier transform \\\\( F(p_{new}(x)) \\\\) be independent of the initial \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Each convolution with a Gaussian kernel modifies the frequency domain representation of the function. The subsequent kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma') \\\\) does not negate the effects of the first \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\), but rather interacts cumulatively, making the final output dependent on both \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\sigma' \\\\).",
