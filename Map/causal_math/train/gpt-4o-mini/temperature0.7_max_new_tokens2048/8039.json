  "Problem": "In a control system, consider a scalar linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p z \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is a constant parameter. The function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\sin(qz) \\\\) is applied, transforming the state, where \\\\( q \\\\) is another constant parameter.\n\nIf we intervene by applying a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = z^2 \\\\) at a time t1, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend exclusively on the parameter \\\\( p \\\\) and not on \\\\( q \\\\) or the details of the transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) = z^2 \\\\) adds a quadratic modification which, combined with the earlier sine transformation, alters the evolution in a complex way dependent on both the parameter \\\\( p \\\\) and the characteristics of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by \\\\( p \\\\), \\\\( q \\\\), and the form of both transformations.",
