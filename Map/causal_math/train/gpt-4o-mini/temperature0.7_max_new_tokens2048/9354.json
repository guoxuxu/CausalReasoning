  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent complex function \\\\( f(z, t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( Tg(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iBs}g(z) ds \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z, t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(z, t) \\\\), it is impossible to revert the operation reliably because the impact of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) might mask the initial conditions irreversibly, especially if A does not commute with B.",
