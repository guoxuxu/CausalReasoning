  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transform with a kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze its effect over time t.\n\nAfter observing the transformed function at time T, is it possible to exactly reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time 0 without additional information about the kernel used?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the phase and frequency characteristics of the original signal in a way that may not be invertible, especially without precise information about the kernel \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\). The loss of certain frequency components due to the convolution with a Gaussian kernel makes it impossible to uniquely identify the original function.",
