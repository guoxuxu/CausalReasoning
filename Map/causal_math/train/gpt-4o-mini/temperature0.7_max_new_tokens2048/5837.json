  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\). We explore the impact of transforming the variable \\\\(u\\\\) using a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a value \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T differ from the evolution of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( u_0 + k \\\\). The nonlinear nature of the equation means that solutions depend sensitively on initial conditions. This shift results in a different trajectory, leading to a different state at time T.",
