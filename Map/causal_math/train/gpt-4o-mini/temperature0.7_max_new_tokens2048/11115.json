  "Problem": "Let's examine a thermal system where temperature \\( T \\) at any point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\), with \\( k \\) as the thermal diffusivity constant. We study the impact of a sudden temperature change applied using a function \\( f(T) = T + h \\), where \\( h \\) is a constant heat increment.\n\nIf at a given time \\( t_1 \\), a new intervention function \\( g(T) = T - c \\) (where \\( c \\) is a constant cooling decrement) is applied, will the endpoint \\( T(x,T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be dependent only on \\( k \\) and not \\( h \\) or \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both interventions (heating and cooling) affect the thermal profile. The endpoint \\( T(x,T) \\) results from the compounded effect of both the initial heat increment and the subsequent cooling, each altering the diffusion process distinctively, hence \\( T(x,T) \\) depends on \\( h \\), \\( c \\), and \\( k \\).",
