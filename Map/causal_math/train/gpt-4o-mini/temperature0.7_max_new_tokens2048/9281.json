  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + pu_x = 0 \\\\), with p being a constant. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx}u(x,t) dx \\\\), to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the system evolves according to the given PDE without further intervention, will the form of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to directly solving the PDE for u(x, T) and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution of the PDE directly yields the characteristic equations, which give \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-ikpt} \\\\). This result is identical whether the Fourier transform is applied initially or after evolution by the PDE, due to the linearity and shift properties of the Fourier transform.",
