  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over complex numbers \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its transformation with a complex integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\tau z(\\\\tau)} d\\\\tau\\\\). We are interested in the behavior of this transformation over time and how interventions might alter this behavior.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention applies a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), will the result at time t = T solely depend on the original function without considering the effects of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) introduces an additional dynamic to the behavior of the function. The outcome at time T will thus not only depend on the original function but also be influenced by how both \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and the quadratic transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) have altered its trajectory.",
