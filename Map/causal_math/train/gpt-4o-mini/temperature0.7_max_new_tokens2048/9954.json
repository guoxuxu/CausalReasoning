  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We review the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), and how it translates to solve the equation in the transformed domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Even if the Fourier transform was applied, it can be inverted, and since it operates linearly and reversibly, determining \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) remains possible either directly or through transforming back from the frequency domain.",
