  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, is studied.\n\nAfter observing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a specific time t, can we determine whether the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, assuming we started with some \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing just \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not the specific details of the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the transformation makes it impossible to definitively conclude whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied. The evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) alone could yield similar states for different initial conditions influenced by varying constants \\\\( a \\\\).",
