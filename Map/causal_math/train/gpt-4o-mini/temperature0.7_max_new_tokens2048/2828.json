  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) with A being a positive constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the scenario where a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transformations \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{C(t-t_1)} \\\\) could yield overlapping or indistinguishable effects regarding magnitude and phase changes, making it challenging to uniquely backtrack and identify which transformations were applied at what times solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
