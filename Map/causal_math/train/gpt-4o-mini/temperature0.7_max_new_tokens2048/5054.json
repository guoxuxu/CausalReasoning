  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping described by \\\\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\\\) in the complex plane, and assess the impact of an integral transformation on this function given as \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int e^{-st} w(t) \\\\, dt \\), where s is a complex number.\n\nCan we determine the original complex function form \\\\(w(z)\\\\) used to achieve a specific output at time \\\\(T\\\\) by solely observing the output without any knowledge of transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "As there were no transformations applied, the time evolution is only guided by the intrinsic properties of \\\\(w(z)\\\\). Thus, knowing the output at time \\\\(T\\\\) which follows this evolution allows tracing back to the exact form of \\\\(w(z)\\\\).",
