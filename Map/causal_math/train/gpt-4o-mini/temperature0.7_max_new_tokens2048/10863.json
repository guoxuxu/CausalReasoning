  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the input-outcome relationship described by \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} Bu(s) ds + e^{At}y_0 \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) represents a control input function.\n\nIf an intervention altering the system matrix A to a new matrix A' is made at time t = 0, will y(T) for T > 0 be predictable just by knowing y_0 and A' regardless of B?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation to A' changes the dynamic properties of the system, but the matrix B still influences y(t) through the control function u(t). Without knowing how B interacts with u(t), predictive accuracy for y(T) just from A' and y_0 is compromised.",
