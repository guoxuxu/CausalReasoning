  "Problem": "Consider a scalar linear time-invariant (LTI) system represented by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = kx\\\\), where k is a real constant. The Laplace transform of x(t) is used to obtain the transfer function, and various filters represented by transfer functions \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p}\\\\) are applied, where p is a pole introduced by the filter.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\(x(0)=x_0\\\\) is given and the system evolves naturally under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = kx\\\\) without the application of any filter, will the function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) be the same at t = T as if a filter with pole p was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The unfiltered system evolves as \\\\(x(t) = x_0 e^{kt}\\\\). Applying a filter modifies the Laplace transform of the input, altering the system's frequency response and hence the time domain solution. The presence of a pole in the filter changes the nature of the system's response, leading to a different trajectory.",
