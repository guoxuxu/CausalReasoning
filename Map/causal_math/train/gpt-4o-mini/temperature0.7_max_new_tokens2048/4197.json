  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) and its inverse.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transformation followed by evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further modification, will the state \\\\( Z(\\\\omega, t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if the Fourier transformation had not been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation changes the representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the time domain to frequency domain. Evolving \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) in the frequency domain means that the outcomes at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depend on how the transformation interacts with the differential equation, likely resulting in a different spectrum compared to an untransformed initial condition.",
