  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{kz} \\\\), where k is a complex constant. We examine the implications of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-iwz} dz \\\\), where w is a real constant representing frequency.\n\nCan one confidently deduce the exact value of k by solely analyzing \\\\( H(w) \\\\) without additional information or context?",
  "Explanation": "The analysis of \\\\( H(w) \\\\) alone generally yields the magnitude and phase alterations induced by the exponentials but isolating the precise value of k, which might contain both real and imaginary parts, requires explicit knowledge of h(z)'s behavior or the setting (e.g., boundary conditions) under which h(z) operates.",
