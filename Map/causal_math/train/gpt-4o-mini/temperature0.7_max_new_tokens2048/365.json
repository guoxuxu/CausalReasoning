  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t)) \\\\) applied to the spatial component of \\\\( u \\\\) and how it translates through time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0) \\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) without additional manipulation, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the result of directly evolving \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0) \\\\) under the transformed operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(L) \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the evolution equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) leads to the transformed equation under \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(L) \\\\). This means that evolving \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(L) \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) using the Fourier transformed rules successfully predicts \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t)) \\\\) at time T, since the Fourier transform linearly translates the effects of L on u.",
