  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and let's analyze its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( I[z](t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\).\n\nIf we observe a non-zero output from the integral transformation at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we precisely determine what phase shift or other transformations were applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "While a non-zero result indicates that some transformation like a phase shift might have been applied, the exact nature and parameters of such transformation (like the value of \\\\( \\phi \\\\)) cannot be uniquely determined based solely on a non-zero result due to potential multi-phase or compound interventions.",
