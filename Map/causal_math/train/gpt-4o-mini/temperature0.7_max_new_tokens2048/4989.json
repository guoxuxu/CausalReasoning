  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a Fourier Transform \\( F(k) \\) applied to a function \\( f(x) \\). We analyze various scenarios where \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\), and ‘a’ is a real constant, to understand the impact of this transformation on the system.\n\nIf \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\) is transformed at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the Fourier Transform, will \\( F(k) \\) at a later time T be the same as if \\( f(x) \\) alone was transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\( e^{ax} \\) represents a modulation which alters the original function \\( f(x) \\). According to the properties of Fourier Transforms, this results in a frequency shift in \\( F(k) \\), which would not be the same as the Fourier Transform of \\( f(x) \\) alone.",
