  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) describes the voltage distribution over a line at position x and time t, and v is a positive constant reflecting the properties of the material. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the voltage distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at time T represent the same system state as if the initial voltage distribution was directly evolved to T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation that translates the partial differential equation into a simpler form where the evolution in time can be separately applied to each frequency component. The initial and transformed systems evolve identically under the assumption that the system is linear and the boundary conditions remain consistent.",
