  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time. The function is transformed by a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We analyze causal inference when altering the frequency spectrum by filtering specific frequency components.\n\nGiven the end-state signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) after sequential filtration interventions, can we determine the exact order or type of filters applied (low-pass then high-pass, or high-pass only), solely from observing \\\\( z''(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end-state signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) may mirror effects compatible with different filter sequences due to overlapping alterations in frequency components. Without explicit information about the filters' characteristics and order, multiple configurations could potentially yield similar resulting time-domain signals.",
