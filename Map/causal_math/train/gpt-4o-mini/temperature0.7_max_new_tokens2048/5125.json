  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network involving a complex impedance function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where s is the complex frequency, and a, b, c are constants. An impulse response h(t) of this network is obtained through the inverse Laplace transform of Z(s).\n\nIf an impedance matching is done by modifying parameter 'a' to 'a+d', without altering the structure of Z(s), will the modified impulse response \\\\( h'(t) \\\\) at a time T be different from the original h(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'a' alters the numerator of the impedance function, which affects the whole function Z(s), and thus changes its inverse Laplace transform h'(t). The resultant impulse response will differ due to the change in the pole-zero configuration.",
