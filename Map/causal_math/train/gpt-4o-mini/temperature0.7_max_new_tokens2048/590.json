  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) yields a unique function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) whose form clearly identifies the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) as the imaginary part of the pole, \\\\( w \\\\) can be precisely determined from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
