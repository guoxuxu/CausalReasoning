  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where c is a speed constant. Study the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t,x)) \\\\) on the spatial variable.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state at time T, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T,x)) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the initial state \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) having known no interventions were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform in the context of the wave equation is reversible due to its properties under linear time-invariant systems. Given \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T,x)) \\\\), we can apply the inverse Fourier transform and use the evolution laws of the wave components to reconstruct \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) accurately.",
