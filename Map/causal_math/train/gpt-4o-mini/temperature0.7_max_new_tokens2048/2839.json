  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nIf at a certain point someone modifies the original function by an additional transformation \\\\( G(x) = x(t) + \\\\alpha sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants, will the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for an arbitrary \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) still reflect only the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( G(x) \\\\) adds a new component to the function, which will also be reflected in the Fourier transform spectrum. The resulting \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) will contain additional frequencies and amplitudes corresponding to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",
