  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at a particular frequency range, can we ascertain the exact initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) used in the differential equation without knowing the specific value of \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the constant \\\\( A \\\\) in the differential equation, reconstructing the precise initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from the Fourier transformed function is ambiguous. The constant \\\\( A \\\\) affects the growth rate and frequency modulation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), both crucial for accurately determining \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from the frequency spectrum.",
