  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is subject to a transformation using a linear time-invariant system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = Ay(t) + Bx(t) \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, and the transformation \\\\( h(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is a filter applied to the output signal, with C and D also being constant matrices.\n\nGiven the output at \\\\( T \\\\), can it be determined precisely whether the filtering \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k(t) \\\\) was used, or both, just by observing the output without additional contextual information?",
  "Explanation": "The superposition and potentially non-commutative effects of the filters \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( k(t) \\\\) along with the system's underlying dynamics make it challenging to distinguish and back-calculate exactly which filters were applied from the output alone. The overlap in potential state changes and transformations masks the unique characteristics of each intervention.",
