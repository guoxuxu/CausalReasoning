  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where c is a speed constant. Study the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t,x)) \\\\) on the spatial variable.\n\nIf during the evolution of the system, a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T,x)) \\\\) solely reflect changes dictated by the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor modifies the amplitude of each frequency component, affecting their evolution irrespective of the original wave equation. This external influence alters how the components decay over time, thereby changing the state at any subsequent time from what would be predicted by the original PDE alone.",
