  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) over time t in the complex plane, and its response under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = kz \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( M(z) = rz \\\\) (where r is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by the behavior of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), not considering the effects of k or r?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by k and the intervention by r both affect the final state of the function. At any time t_1, applying \\\\( M(z) \\\\) results in an immediate scaling of the function's current state, which continues to evolve multiplicatively under the exponential function. Therefore, the final state at T is a product of these transformations as well as the natural evolution, making it dependent on both k and r, not solely on the behavior of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\).",
