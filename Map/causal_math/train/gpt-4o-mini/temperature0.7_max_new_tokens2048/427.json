  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impacts of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the function over time, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original differential equation parameters and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduce additional modifying factors through the constants \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), influencing the trajectory and thus the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The presence of these transformations means that the endpoint depends not only on the differential equation parameters but also significantly on the characteristics of these transformations.",
