  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation governed by Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx \\\\). We study the effect of applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), which is the multiplication of f(x) by x, and its impact over the transformed function.\n\nFrom observing the resulting spectrum after interventions (multiplication by x and differentiation), can we unambiguously define the sequence or type of operations (whether multiplication by x or differentiation, or both) performed on \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations applied (both multiplication and differentiation) would alter the spectrum in a way that complexity increases, making it difficult to discern the detailed sequence of operations from the final Fourier Transform, owing to intrinsic interdependencies and potential overlap of transformation effects.",
