  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region undergoing a heat transfer process modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T + S(x,y,z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(T\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term depending on position and time. An intervention is introduced by applying a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(T) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( T_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(T) \\\\) modifies the initial temperature distribution introducing an additional decay term \\\\( \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\). The evolution of \\\\( T(t) \\\\) will then include the effects of this term throughout the interval, leading to a temperature distribution at time T that differs from the one obtained by evolving \\\\( T_0 \\\\) directly under the heat equation.",
