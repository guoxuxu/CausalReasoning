  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, transformed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAt} z \\\\) over time t, where A is a real constant. This represents a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the complex plane at some time T, can one deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing the value of A?",
  "Explanation": "The effect, \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT} z_0 \\\\), depends critically on A. Without knowledge of A, one cannot determine the angle of rotation and therefore cannot reliably compute the inverse transformation to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
