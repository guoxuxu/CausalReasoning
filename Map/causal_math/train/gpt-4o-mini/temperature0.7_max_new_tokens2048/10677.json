  "Problem": "Consider the diffusion equation for heat transfer in a rod, \\\\( \\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = k \\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial x^2 \\\\), where u is the temperature, x is the spatial variable, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effect of an initial function \\\\( u(x,0) = e^{ax} \\\\), where a is also a constant.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) = e^{ax} \\\\) is applied and the system evolves according to the diffusion equation without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t be solely governed by the parameter a?",
  "Explanation": "Though the initial condition is set by a, the evolution of the temperature profile over time is controlled by the thermal diffusivity k and the nature of the diffusion equation, not just by a. The parameter a sets the initial state, but the dynamics are governed by the differential operator.",
