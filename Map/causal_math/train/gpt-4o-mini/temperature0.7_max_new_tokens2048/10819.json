  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real frequency. Assess the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau} z(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system by applying a different frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at time t = t_1, will the transformation \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) from t = t_1 to t = T still only reflect the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in frequency alters the system's behavior fundamentally, affecting the output of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) from t = t_1 to T, reflecting the new frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) along with the initial frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
