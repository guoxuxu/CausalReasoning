  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and let an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. The study involves analyzing how transformations affect the function and its integration outcomes.\n\nGiven the outcome after changing the parameter during transformation to \\\\( s' \\\\), is it possible to definitively determine if the original parameter was \\\\( s \\\\) or some other value based on the transformed result alone?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple parameters could lead to similar or indistinguishable results upon transformation due to the nature of the exponential function and its integration, making it impossible to distinctly identify the original parameter \\\\( s \\\\) used before switching to \\\\( s' \\\\).",
