  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega t} w \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The system under study is defined by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation on the system evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( z(w) \\\\) changes the initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} w_0 \\\\). The system's evolution is thus influenced by the new initial condition, which includes the modulation by the factor \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). This affects the state trajectory differently than if the evolution started from \\\\( w_0 \\\\) directly.",
