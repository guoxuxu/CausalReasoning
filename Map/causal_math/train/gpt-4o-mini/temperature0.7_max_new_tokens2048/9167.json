  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to study its behavior over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention with another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant, is applied, will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 exclusively depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) both modify the trajectory and magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through their respective exponential factors \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\). Thus, the state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), depends not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) due to these transformations.",
