  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), on this function over the frequency domain.\n\nIf an additional time-scaling transformation \\\\( h(t) = z(at) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, is applied before taking Fourier transform, does the resultant \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) still depend solely on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the time-scaling transformation alters the frequency of the original function to \\\\( a\\\\omega \\\\). Therefore, the Fourier transform will now peak at \\\\( a\\\\omega \\\\), indicating dependency not only on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the scaling factor \\\\( a \\\\).",
