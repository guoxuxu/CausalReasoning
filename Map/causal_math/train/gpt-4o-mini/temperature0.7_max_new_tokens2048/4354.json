  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, retrieving the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible. The potential application of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could have changed the initial state, making it impossible to reverse-engineer the system's history from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional information.",
