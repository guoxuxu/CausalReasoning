  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\), where \\( p \\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effects of changing \\( p \\) and the impact of convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) represented by its transform \\( G(s) = e^{-qs} \\), where \\( q \\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\( f(t) \\)'s Laplace transform is convolved with \\( G(s) \\) at some time \\( T \\), resulting in \\( F(s) * G(s) \\), will the resultant transform solely depend on the original \\( p \\) and ignore \\( q \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution in the Laplace domain (multiplication in time domain) of \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) results in combined effects of the two functions, hence the resultant transform depends on both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\). The value \\( q \\) affects how \\( f(t) \\) is modulated by \\( g(t) \\).",
