  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} ds \\), which represents a transformation applied to a real domain variable t. Here, s is a complex parameter and we are analyzing the behavior under linear transformations represented by matrix multiplication.\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were used (initially with A and later with B) by observing only the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the additive and non-commutative nature of integrating over paths affected by different matrix transformations, multiple combinations of A and B can lead to the same result in \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the end result doesn't uniquely define the interventions used.",
