  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\), is it possible to infer the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) used over the interval without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The knowledge of \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) alone, without additional details about the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or the absence of other transformations or interference during the period, is insufficient to definitively determine the form or parameters of the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
