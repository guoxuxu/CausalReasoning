  "Problem": "A complex function is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = cz + d \\\\) over time t, where c and d are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve naturally, will \\\\( L(z(t)) \\\\) at any time t > 0 be equivalent to the direct evaluation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the original function without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L(z) \\\\) modifies the initial output of the function by adding a constant and scaling it, changing the trajectory of the solution over time. The transformation changes both amplitude and phase components of the function, resulting in a wave pattern different from the untransformed case.",
