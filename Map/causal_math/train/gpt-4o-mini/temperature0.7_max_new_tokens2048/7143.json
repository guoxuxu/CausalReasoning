  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being real constants.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend exclusively on \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) and not on the initial parameters \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the dynamics from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, but the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is already significantly shaped by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Thus, the system's final state at T will reflect both the influence of original parameters up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the new dynamics post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
