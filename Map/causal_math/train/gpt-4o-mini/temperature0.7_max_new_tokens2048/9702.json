  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the influence of the integral transformation defined by \\\\\\( F[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) from the transformed function \\\\\\( F[z](s) \\\\\\) without additional information? Assume \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) initially was \\\\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\).",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\\\( F[z](s) \\\\\\) mixes the frequency components and temporal characteristics into a complex exponential integral that typically requires inversion and additional information on the original frequency \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\). Without this, the original form \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved.",
