  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) on an infinite rod, where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) represent the partial derivatives of temperature \\\\(u\\\\) with respect to time \\\\(t\\\\) and the second spatial derivative with respect to \\\\(x\\\\), respectively. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x, t) \\\\, dx\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, 0)\\\\) is obtained from \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator and preserves the linear dynamics under the heat equation. As the heat equation's solution in the transform domain satisfies the same differential equation, applying the inverse Fourier transform recovers the evolved temperature distribution, ensuring the state at time T is consistent.",
