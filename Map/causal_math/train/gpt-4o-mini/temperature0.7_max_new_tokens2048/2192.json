  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) where L is a linear operator on a function space, and the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Analyze how the system behaves under the Fourier transform and its inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nGiven the time-series data \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}x(T) \\\\), can we determine what interventions occurred (specifically whether the Fourier transform, the filter \\\\( H(f) \\\\), or both were applied) solely based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the type and sequence of interventions from the end state is complex due to the intertwining of transformations in time and frequency domains. The final observed state could arise from different combinations of initial conditions and interventions, making exact determination from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone infeasible.",
