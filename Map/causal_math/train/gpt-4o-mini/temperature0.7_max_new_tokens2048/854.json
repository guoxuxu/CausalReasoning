  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time given by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system is subject to a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nObserving the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time T, without knowing whether transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Given the influence of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), the final observed state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can result from different initial conditions due to the multiplicative shifting effect of \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information on the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
