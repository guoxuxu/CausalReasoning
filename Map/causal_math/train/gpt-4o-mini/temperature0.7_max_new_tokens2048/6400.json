  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) with \\( \\lambda > 0 \\), and consider the transformation \\( T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t} \\) applied to \\( u \\).\n\nGiven \\( u(x, T) \\) under repeated applications of \\( T(u) \\), can we deduce the exact times \\( t_i \\) when \\( T(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The result of applying \\( T(u) \\) repeatedly produces a state that masks the effects of \\( -\\lambda u \\), making it indistinguishable when during the timeline the interventions occurred just from observing \\( u(x, T) \\). The end state could be consistent with various sequences and timings of applying \\( T(u) \\), particularly without additional information on the dynamics between the intervals.",
