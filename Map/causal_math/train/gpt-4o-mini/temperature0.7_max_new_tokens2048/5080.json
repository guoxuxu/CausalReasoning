  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We study the influence of the transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions used from just \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is unfeasible due to the overlapping and combined influences of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Since both apply scaling and rotation, multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) can yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
