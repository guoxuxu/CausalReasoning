  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Qz \\\\), where Q is a constant complex matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) over time t, where P is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we accurately retrieve the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of knowledge regarding the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is not possible to accurately determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation \\\\( e^{Pt} \\\\) could have altered the initial state in a way that is not directly invertible, especially if P and Q are non-commutative.",
