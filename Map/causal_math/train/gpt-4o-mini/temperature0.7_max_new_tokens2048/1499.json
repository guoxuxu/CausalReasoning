  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another modifying factor. Therefore, the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interactions of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), making the state at T an outcome influenced by all these parameters.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The change in z over time is determined by the rate of change dz/dt, which is influenced by the constant omega. The transformation g(z) alters z(t) based on the parameter alpha, and the intervention h(z) modifies z(T) using the parameter beta. However, the endpoint z(T) depends primarily on omega and is influenced by the transformations g(z) and h(z) only through their effects on z.",
