  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining a trajectory in the complex plane over time t. Let there be a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another rotation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the ending trajectory of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original dynamics and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another influencing factor, so the final trajectory \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), as well as the original dynamics. The combined effects of the rotations influence the ultimate position and orientation in the complex plane.",
