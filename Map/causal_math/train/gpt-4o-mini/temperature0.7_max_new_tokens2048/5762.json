  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We investigate the effect of the inverse transformation given by multiplying the transform by \\\\( s^2 \\\\) and then applying the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nKnowing the function \\\\( g(t) = t^2f(t) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without any initial values?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( g(t) = t^2f(t) \\\\), it is possible to algebraically manipulate and apply inverse operations to recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Since the modification applied was explicit and invertible, recovering \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) from its modified state is feasible through differentiation and adjustment by factors of \\\\( t \\\\).",
