  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a series of transforms: firstly by Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), followed by a scaling function in the frequency domain \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then by inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\). Analyze the impact of this transformation chain and its effect on the time-domain behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is it possible to determine the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without additional information about \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without detailed knowledge of the scaling function \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), the effect of scaling on the Fourier transform cannot be undone reliably. This makes it ambiguous in reconstructing the original signal exactly from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) alone.",
