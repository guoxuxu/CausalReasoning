  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in control theory, described by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \\\\), where \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) are polynomial functions of the complex variable s. We investigate the behavior of the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) when the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is subjected to the Fourier Transform of a step function, i.e., \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) is directly applied to the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, where the superposition and convolution principles hold, the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) for a given input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) through the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) will indeed be \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) under ideal conditions without additional modifications or interventions.",
