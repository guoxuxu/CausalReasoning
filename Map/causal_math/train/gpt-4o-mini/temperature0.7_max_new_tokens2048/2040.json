  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) represents the Laplacian operator. We are interested in the effect of applyingt the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\), which transforms the function into the Fourier space, on the causal inference in the system.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine whether an inverse Fourier transformation was applied at any time or multiple times before \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and invertibility of the Fourier transform and its inverse, multiple applications of these transformations commute and the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) does not encode whether or which transformation was applied before \\\\( T \\\\). The resultant state could be achieved with or without any number of transformations.",
