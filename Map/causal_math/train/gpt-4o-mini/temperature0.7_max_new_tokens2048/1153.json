  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\), where D is a linear differential operator. Investigate the influence of a transformation characterised by \\\\( h(z) = z^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\) on the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where k is a non-zero scalar and C is a constant.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at x = 0, followed by evolution under \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\) without further interventions, will \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to x = X under \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial state by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( z_0^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\). The modified initial condition affects the trajectory as per the given differential equation, leading to a distinct state at x = X.",
