  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, and its impact when integrated along a path in the complex plane. The study explores how the path of integration, and potential path modifications (interventions), affect the evaluation of the integral.\n\nIf the integral of \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) is taken along a simple path from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\) without any pathway changes, will the resultant value change if the path's parameterization is altered but still connects \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral's result depends only on the endpoints and the function's nature, not on the specific parameterization of the path due to the path-independence in the analytic nature of the function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\).",
