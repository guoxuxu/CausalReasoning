  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit where the input voltage \\\\(V_{in}(t)\\\\) is related to the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) via a transfer function defined by \\\\( I(t) = K \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(s-t)} V_{in}(s) ds \\\\), where K and A are constants.\n\nCan we precisely identify what changes were made to A (with or without constant \\\\( C \\\\)) based solely on the observation of \\\\( I(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral in the transfer function results in a state dependent on the entire history of both \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) and parameter changes in A. Disambiguating the influence of modifications to A merely from the final current at \\\\( I(T) \\\\) is not feasible without additional information about the input voltage history and all parameter changes.",
