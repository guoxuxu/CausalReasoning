  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with conductivity k. An initial heating pattern v(x) is applied as an initial condition and after a time period, a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x,t)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) is a heating function, is introduced.\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution u(x,T), can we accurately determine the initial heating pattern and whether any intervention h(x,t) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The same final temperature distribution u(x,T) could arise from different initial conditions v(x) combined with different forms or absences of the intervention h(x,t). The intrinsic nature of the heat equation and possible functions h(x,t) create multiple possible combinations leading to the same endpoint, preventing unique determination of v(x) and h(x,t) solely from u(x,T).",
