  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We assess the impact of the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) over time t, where \\( \\alpha \\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( g(z) \\), the observed \\( z(t) \\) could be the result of different initial conditions altered by \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\). Since the exponentiation can introduce significant changes depending on \\( \\alpha \\), \\( z_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( z(T) \\) without that knowledge.",
