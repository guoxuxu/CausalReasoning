  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) is used to solve the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = f(t) \\\\). The transform function is applied to both sides leading to an algebraic equation in the complex domain.\n\nDoes solving the transformed equation and applying the inverse Laplace transform bring back the effect \\\\( y(t) \\\\) identical to the one that would result from directly solving the differential equation with the same initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform method and its inverse are mathematically designed to preserve the equivalence between the transformed domain and time domain solutions under the same initial conditions. Therefore, solving the differential equation directly or via the Laplace transform should yield the same result for \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
