  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of the integral transform \\( g(z) = \\int e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nCan the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) of \\( z(t) \\) be directly deduced from the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) contains information about the frequency \\( \\omega \\), it is intertwined with the exponential decay imposed by \\( s \\). Without knowing the value of \\( s \\), we cannot accurately reconstruct \\( \\omega \\) from \\( g(z) \\) alone.",
