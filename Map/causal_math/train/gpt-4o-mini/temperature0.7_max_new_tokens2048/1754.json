  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapped in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants, over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) could have altered the initial state in a way that isn't uniquely recoverable just through observing the end state after evolving.",
