  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. We introduce a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that takes the form \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a finite time.\n\nGiven the result produced by \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation by \\\\( L \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time with exponential weighting, which can obscure specific details of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) especially its phase components. Different functions could potentially yield the same result under \\\\( L \\\\), particularly if they are phase-shifted versions of each other.",
