  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and the function evolves over time t. We investigate how transformations involving the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function affect computations and inferences.\n\nIf \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further modification, and the resulting function is then inversely transformed at time T under the same transformation, does the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) match the original function at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform and its inverse are mathematically defined to recover the original function when applied consecutively without any intervention. This implies that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be the same as the initial function at time T, given no modifications were done between transformations.",
