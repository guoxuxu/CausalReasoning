  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The transformation specified by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to study the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Kt}z \\\\) (where K is a constant complex matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by M, independent of N or K?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity to the system, affecting the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The outcome depends not only on M but also on the interplay between N and K, as these transformations may have non-trivial, non-commuting effects that influence the system's evolution.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The differential equation governing z(t) is influenced by the constant matrix M, which determines the behavior of z(t) over time. The transformations g(z) and h(z) apply different constant matrices N and K, respectively, affecting the state of z(t) at different times. However, the state z(T) for T > t_1 is ultimately determined by M, indicating that the influence of N or K does not change the fundamental behavior dictated by M after the intervention.",
