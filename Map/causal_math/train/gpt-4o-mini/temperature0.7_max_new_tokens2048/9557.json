  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system modeled by \\( Ax = b \\) for a vector \\( x \\) and matrix \\( A \\), involving transformations by a function \\( f(x) = Mx \\) where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We assess causal impacts in the presence of this transformation.\n\nIf the transformation \\( f(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) solving \\( Ax = b \\), and then the system evolves naturally without further intervention, will the solution \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) still satisfy \\( Ax = b \\) without alterations to \\( A \\) or \\( b \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(x) \\) to \\( x_0 \\) modifies \\( x_0 \\) to \\( Mx_0 \\). Unless \\( M \\) is an identity or commutes in a specific way with \\( A \\), the product \\( AMx_0 \\) will not necessarily equal \\( b \\), changing the end condition of the equation.",
