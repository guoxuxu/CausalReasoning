  "Explanation": "The operations involved in transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to the Laplace domain can overlap in effect and do not necessarily leave distinguishable signatures to indicate sequence, especially without explicit knowledge of how each operation was designed (e.g., limits of integration or orders of derivatives). Resultantly, the sequence of operations cannot be explicitly discerned from the final transform alone.",
