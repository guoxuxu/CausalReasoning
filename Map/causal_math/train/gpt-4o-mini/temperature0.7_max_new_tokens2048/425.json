  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impacts of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the function over time, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha \\\\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), which does not change the initial condition. However, the evolution incorporates a continuous transformation by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), changing the trajectory and affecting the final state at time T compared to the untransformed evolution.",
