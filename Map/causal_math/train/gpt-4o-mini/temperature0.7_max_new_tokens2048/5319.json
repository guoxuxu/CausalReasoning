  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iωt}\\\\) where \\\\(ω\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a transformation by applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). Further, at a later time, an external operator applies \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nAssuming at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on the original \\\\( ω \\\\) without considering the impacts of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\\\). The squaring operation alters the frequency, and the reciprocal transformation \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) will change both the magnitude and phase of the trajectory. Thus, the endpoint depends significantly on both transformations.",
