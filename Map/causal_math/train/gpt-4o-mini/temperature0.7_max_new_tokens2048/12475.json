  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) representing a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\\\), and how it maps the function into a complex frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine whether there was an intervention in the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) merely by inspecting the final Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "If the Laplace transform deviates from \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), it indicates a modification to the original frequency. The transform’s denominator \\\\( s - i(\\omega + \\delta) \\\\) directly reflects the intervened frequency, allowing detection of changes from the original signal.",
