  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. \\nWe investigate how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{wt}z\\\\), where w is a complex constant, affects this function over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied, any observed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from multiple potential initial states due to the additional scaling and rotation introduced by \\\\(e^{wt}\\\\). Thus, the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
