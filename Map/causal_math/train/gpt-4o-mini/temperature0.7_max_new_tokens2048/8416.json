  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) operating on the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. We explore how linear transformations given by matrices affect this function through Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\), characterized as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed frequency function \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\), can we determine the specific matrix \\\\( A \\\\) used to modify \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) before taking the Fourier Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) encapsulates the effect of \\\\( A \\\\) as an integral part of its transformation but abstracts out explicit parameters of \\\\( A \\\\), such that multiple matrices could result in the same or similar changes in \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\). Thus, identifying \\\\( A \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) isn't feasible.",
