  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system modeled by \\( Ax = b \\) for a vector \\( x \\) and matrix \\( A \\), involving transformations by a function \\( f(x) = Mx \\) where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We assess causal impacts in the presence of this transformation.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( x_0 \\) after observing \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\( f(x) \\) was applied, reconstructing \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) becomes uncertain, as \\( x(T) \\) could be either \\( x_0 \\) or \\( Mx_0 \\), depending on the application of \\( f(x) \\). Without knowledge of \\( M \\), the initial vector cannot be precisely deduced.",
