  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}t^z \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. The integral is an example of a complex function involving a Mellin transform.\n\nIf the parameter s is modified at some point by an additive constant c (a new s becomes s+c), does this change the original integral's convergence behavior for \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing s to s+c significantly alters the integral's convergence condition depending on the real part of c. If c shifts the real part of s to be less than or equal to zero, it could affect whether or not the integral converges.",
