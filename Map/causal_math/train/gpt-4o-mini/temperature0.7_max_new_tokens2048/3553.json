  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-s^2} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) represents an input function. We study the role of transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) on input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and observe its impact over the interval [0, a].\n\nIf the input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is modified by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x) = g(x) \\\\) at x = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given integral transformation, will \\\\( y(a) \\\\) for a given a > 0 be the same as if the original \\\\( u(x) \\\\) was used without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation will yield different results since \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) alters the input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) across the domain [0, a]. The specific properties of \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\) will interact differently with the squared term, leading to variations in the integral result.",
