  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Question the impact of applying a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^k \\\\) at different times, where k is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of certainty about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) means that from \\\\( z(T) \\\\), which could be either \\\\( e^{AT}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{AT}(z_0^k) \\\\), we cannot unambiguously revert to the exact \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since multiple initial states through transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could lead to the same observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
