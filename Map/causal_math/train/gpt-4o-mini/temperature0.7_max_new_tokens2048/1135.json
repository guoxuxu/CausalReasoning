  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant complex frequency. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied, resulting in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) (as an intervention), making the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i (\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)} \\\\), will the Fourier transform at \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\) still be non-zero?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i (\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)} \\\\) shifts the function in the frequency domain, but it still centers around \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), with a modified phase in its spectral representation. The delta function's location (indicating non-zero spectrum) does not change with phase shift, thus remaining non-zero at the original frequency.",
