  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace transform of its input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), giving \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\. The output of the system is described by the function \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is the system's transfer function. We examine the effects of modifying the input signal using the transformation \\\\( g(x) = x(t) * e^{-at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the original signal \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) after observing the transformed output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), without knowing whether transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, and given that the output depends on the altered Laplace transform \\\\( X(s+a) \\\\), it is impractical to uniquely back-calculate to the original \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\), especially without knowing the value of \\\\( a \\\\).",
