  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We're studying the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we apply a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( T(z) \\\\) for t = T > t_1 be influenced solely by the operation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) and not by \\\\( U(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U(z) \\\\) may alter the system state at or before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) which affects the whole subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that will modify how \\\\( T(z) \\\\) ultimately computes at any t > t_1. This changes the trajectory in a manner dependent also on \\\\( U(z) \\\\).",
