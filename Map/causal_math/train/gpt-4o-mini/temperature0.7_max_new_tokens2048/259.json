  "Problem": "We are examining the behavior of a complex valued function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where z is a complex number and A is a complex matrix. Consider the effects of applying Laplace transform on this function.\n\nIf a derivative operation applied to \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) before transforming, does the result solely depend on A?",
  "Explanation": "The derivative, which adjusts the input function before the transform, modifies the function in a way that remains tied to the properties of A. Even with intervention, the outcome of the transformation is still dictated by the characteristics of A.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex number z causes the function w(z) to be defined, while the complex matrix A influences the behavior of w(z). The function w(z) is then affected by the derivative operation, which leads to a new function derivative(w(z)). Finally, the Laplace transform is applied to derivative(w(z)), making its outcome dependent on the previous transformations.",
