  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nIf \\\\( T[f] \\\\) is applied to \\\\( w(z) \\\\) without any additional manipulation, will the transformed function at \\\\( z = z_1 \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( w(z) \\\\) was not integrated but directly computed at \\\\( z_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform changes the nature of the function from an exponential form to one involving the integral of an exponential, which is fundamentally different from the original function. Direct computation of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) yields \\\\( e^{Az_1} \\\\), whereas the integral will result in a function depending on the integral of \\\\( e^{As} \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( z_1 \\\\).",
