  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a system exhibiting harmonic motion in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-s\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nCan we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by just observing the result of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at any time T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alone is not possible because the integral transformation effectively 'blurs' different portions of the trajectory, depending on the decay factor and the system's oscillatory nature, making it difficult to recover \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely.",
