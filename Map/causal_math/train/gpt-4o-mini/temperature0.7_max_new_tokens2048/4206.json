  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. Let's delve into the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) applied over time t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) can change the initial conditions beyond recognition, especially if \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) have varied sensitivities to phase changes introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Without this knowledge, the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced.",
