  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation applied is \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, any observed rotation or change in phase of the vector cannot be confidently attributed to either the intrinsic behavior or the transformation. Consequently, the original value \\\\(z_0\\\\) cannot be determined uniquely.",
