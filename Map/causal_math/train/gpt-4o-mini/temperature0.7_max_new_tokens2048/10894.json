  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\) applied on a function F(s), and its subsequent inverse Laplace transformation to retrieve g(t). Analyze the influence of a linear differential operator \\( D \\), where \\( Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\) (a is a constant), on the transformed function and its retrieval.\n\nAfter observing \\( h(t) \\) at t = T, can we conclusively determine if \\( D \\) was applied on \\( g(t) \\) before the inverse Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without initial conditions or additional information about the original function \\( f(t) \\) and its properties, the observed \\( h(t) \\) might not uniquely indicate the application of \\( D \\) due to potential similarities in transformed and retrieved function structures.",
