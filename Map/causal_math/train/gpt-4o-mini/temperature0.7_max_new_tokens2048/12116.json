  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(z)(t) \\\\) at any time t be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since the original function is unchanged by the existence of the frequency component that it is itself, the transform simplifies analysis by isolating that frequency, and the output is effectively zero away from this specific frequency.",
