  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. The system's state evolution is evaluated under the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t = \\\\pi/2 \\\\) an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\\\), will the Fourier transform at time T > \\\\pi/2 reflect this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the fundamental frequency of the function from 1 to -1 at \\\\( t = \\\\pi/2 \\\\), which means the Fourier transform will now show a peak at -1 instead of 1, reflecting the change in the system's behavior due to the intervention.",
