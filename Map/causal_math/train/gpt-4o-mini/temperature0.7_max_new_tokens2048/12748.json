  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a metal rod T(x,t) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We examine the impact of a temperature altering function \\\\(g(T) = T + e^{-\\lambda t}\\\\) applied at t = 0 and explore how this function affects the temperature evolution over time.\n\nIf \\\\(g(T)\\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(T(x, 0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(T(x, 0)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\(g(T)\\\\) changes the initial temperature condition, introducing an exponential decay dependent on \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) and time t. Since the heat equation is sensitive to initial conditions, the resulting temperature distribution at any later time t=T will differ from the scenario where \\\\(T(x, 0)\\\\) was left to evolve under the heat equation alone.",
