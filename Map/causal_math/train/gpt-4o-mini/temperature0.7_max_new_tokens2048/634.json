  "Problem": "Consider the calculation of the inverse Laplace transform of a function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\\\) which can describe a physical system's response. Further, analyze the effect of altering the Laplace domain equation by introducing a convolution with another function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the resulting function from the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we infer the exact form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\\\) without any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, the inverse Laplace transform uniquely determines \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from its time-domain equivalent due to the one-to-one mapping of the Laplace transform, allowing precise determination of the cause (original Laplace domain function) from the effect (time-domain response).",
