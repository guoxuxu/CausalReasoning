  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) \\) defined on the complex plane where \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z^t \\, dt \\), and \\( s \\) is a fixed complex number. The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after computing \\( f(z_0) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), the original value \\( z_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( f(z_0) \\) given the potential modification imposed by \\( g(z) = z^s \\). The properties of the integral and the complex exponential transformation mean multiple values for \\( z_0 \\) could yield the same result after transformation and computation.",
