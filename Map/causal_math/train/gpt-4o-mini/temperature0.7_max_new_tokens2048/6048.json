  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of this function is studied under a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different intervals of time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence of transformations applied (\\( h(z) \\\\) and/or \\( j(z) \\)) just by knowing the state at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the multiplicative nature of exponential and polynomial transformations in complex functions, different sequences and choices of transformations can lead to the same final state. For instance, the effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) followed by \\\\( j(z) \\\\) might not be distinguishable from a different sequence or even a single transformation due to overlapping effects in the exponential domain.",
