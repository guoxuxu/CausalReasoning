  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We analyze the effect of complex conjugation on this function and any potential impacts on integral transformations of the resulting function over time t.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a function at t = T, can we deduce if the original input was \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or its transformation \\\\( f(z^*) \\\\) without any prior information on complex conjugation?",
  "Explanation": "The properties of the Fourier transform with respect to phase shifts make it difficult to uniquely identify the sign of the imaginary exponent in the original function, as both \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-iz} \\\\) can lead to similar magnitude spectra but different phase spectra which may not be discernible without additional information.",
