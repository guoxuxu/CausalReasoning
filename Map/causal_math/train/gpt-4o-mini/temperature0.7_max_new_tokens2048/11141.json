  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = w^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We evaluate the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z(w) \\\\) in a path where \\\\( w \\\\) encircles the origin, will the value of the transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) remain the same as if the path did not encircle the origin?",
  "Explanation": "Encircling the origin changes the values of \\\\( w^n \\\\) due to the multi-valued nature of the power function with complex exponent. The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will yield different results due to changes in the integration path, affecting how the exponential decay influences the power function.",
