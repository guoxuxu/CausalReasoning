  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\). This differential equation describes a rotation in the complex plane. The function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were employed (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations of intervening transformations, making it impossible to discern from the endpoint alone whether \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\",
