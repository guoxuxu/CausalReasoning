  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. This function represents a simple harmonic motion on the complex plane. We examine the effects of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a constant integer, on the function's behavior over time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a specific end time T, can it be deduced definitively which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact transformations used to arrive at a specific state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not possible just by knowing the outcome, especially without clear timestamps or knowledge of specific transformation indices (n, m). The mathematical nature of exponentiation in complex functions often leads to results that different sequences of transformations could produce, making it ambiguous.",
