  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(w) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\), mapped over the complex plane. We are interested in examining the changes in the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed contour in the w-plane, particularly under the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\).\n\nIf a new function \\\\( H(w) = e^{aw} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention at some point during the contour evolution, will the resulting integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) solely depend on the original function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( T(w) \\\\) or \\\\( H(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(w) = e^{aw} \\\\) further modifies the path and value of \\\\( w \\\\) along contour \\\\( C \\\\), which will in turn affect the computed values of \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\) over \\\\( C \\\\). Both transformations \\\\( T(w) \\\\) and \\\\( H(w) \\\\) significantly influence the integral, thereby making the result dependent not only on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) but also on the effects of \\\\( T(w) \\\\) and \\\\( H(w) \\\\).",
