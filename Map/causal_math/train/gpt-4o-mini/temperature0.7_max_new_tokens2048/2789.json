  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and its transformation by an integral operator \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi e^{-it}z(t) dt \\\\). Analyze this transformation and its properties.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is as defined, will applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then letting it evolve without any intervention change the nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) integrates \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a kernel function \\\\( e^{-it} \\\\), effectively altering the original function. Although \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself as a function of time remains periodic, the operation by \\\\( T \\\\) computes a Fourier-type integral that essentially changes the information contained within the function, specifically evaluating to zero, thus changing the 'nature' or representation of the function.",
