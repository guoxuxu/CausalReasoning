  "Problem": "Examine a control system defined by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix and \\(D\\) is the control input matrix. The analysis covers the impact of a non-linear transformation \\( h(x) = \\sin(Kt) x \\) on the system's state \\(x\\), over time \\(t\\), where \\(K\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), a linear intervention \\( i(x) = Ptx \\) (where \\( Pt \\) is a time-dependent matrix) is applied, does the outcome \\( x(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) exclusively depend on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) and not on \\( K \\) or \\( Pt \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional linear intervention \\( i(x) \\) creates a new dynamic whereby \\( x(T) \\) is influenced contextually by \\(C\\), \\(D\\), on top of \\(K\\) from the non-linear scaling, and \\(Pt\\) from the intervention, thus affecting the trajectory and final state of the system in a way that relies on all involved matrices.",
