  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, and its impact when integrated along a path in the complex plane. The study explores how the path of integration, and potential path modifications (interventions), affect the evaluation of the integral.\n\nIf during the path from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\), an intervention is made to deliberately encircle a singularity of another function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - c} \\\\), will this affect the integral result of \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a second function's singularity affects only its own integral behavior. The function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) remains unaffected by the singularity of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as long as \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) does not have a singularity at the same point.",
