  "Problem": "Consider the integral equation of the form \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix determining the system's dynamics and f(s) is a vector function. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform and its inverse on this system.\n\nCan we uniquely reconstruct the function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) from the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), if no information about the initial function modification (by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) is provided?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform gives us a potential function \\\\( y(t) \\\\), but without knowing the modifications applied to \\\\( f(s) \\\\) such as the scalar multiplication by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), multiple feasible functions \\\\( f(s) \\\\) could correspond to the same output, hampering unique reconstruction.",
