  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We evaluate its behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{(iw + k)t}z \\\\) (with \\\\( k \\\\) a real number) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original frequency \\\\( w \\\\) without influence from the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) (which combines frequency shifting and the original dynamics) alongside \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) manipulates both the magnitude and phase of the complex function over time. Hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) depends on the interplay of \\\\( w \\\\), \\\\( k \\\\), and the power raised by the transformation (cubing), affecting both amplitude and phase.",
