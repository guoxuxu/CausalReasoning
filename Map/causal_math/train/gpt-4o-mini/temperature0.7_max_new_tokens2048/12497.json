  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane. The function is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\), implying a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at some \\\\( z \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the pre-transformation complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is difficult to trace back to the original value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( h(z_0) = iz_0 \\\\) could potentially yield various results under \\\\( g \\\\), depending on the characteristics of \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\).",
