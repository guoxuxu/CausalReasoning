  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\alpha s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations or a single transformation with different parameters. The nature of integral transformations and their effects on phase and amplitude makes it challenging to unequivocally determine the specific interventions or their parameters solely based on the endpoint.",
