  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\). We evaluate the use of an exponential transformation defined by the function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\), where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) (where D is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original \\( z_0 \\) and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\( h(z) \\) and the prior application of \\( g(z) \\) result in accumulated effects on the trajectory of \\( z \\), changing the endpoint \\( z(T) \\). Each of these transformations scales the evolved state in different manners as dictated by the exponential factors \\( e^{Ct} \\) and \\( e^{Dt} \\), thus affecting the final value at \\( z(T) \\).",
