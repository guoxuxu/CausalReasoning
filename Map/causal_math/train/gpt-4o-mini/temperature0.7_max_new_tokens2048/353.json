  "Problem": "We examine a system defined by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. The effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and how it affects the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) over time are investigated.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_0)\\\\) is calculated at t = 0 without further intervention, does the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at a later time t = T remain the same as if the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was untouched?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the initial condition by transforming it into the frequency domain. This transformation changes the way the solution evolves over time according to the PDE, since the differential operator \\\\(L\\\\) acts differently in the frequency domain.",
