  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and this function is applied in a complex analysis setting. We explore the role of a contour integral transformation of this function over a closed path in the complex plane.\n\nIs the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a simple closed contour C that encloses the point z=0 the same as the integral over any other contour that does not enclose z=0?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) over a closed contour that encloses z=0 will pick up contributions from the residues inside the contour. Since e^z is entire and has no singularities, the result will be zero by the Residue Theorem only if no singular points (like branch points or poles) are enclosed by C. Different contours enclose different configurations of singularities.",
