  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\), with \\\\(c\\\\) being a constant complex number. Study the behavior of this system under the integral transformation \\\\(T_c(z) = \\\\int_0^t (z(s) + c) \\\\, ds\\\\), focusing on how \\\\(c\\\\) influences the trajectory.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\(T_c(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and the system then evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\) without any further manipulation, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t = T\\\\) strictly be a function of the initial condition \\\\(z(0)\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, because the system's evolution rule \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\) and the transformation \\\\(T_c(z)\\\\) are inherently based on the initial state and the constant \\\\(c\\\\). The evolution and resulting state at any \\\\(t = T\\\\) are direct consequences of these initial conditions and the specific system setting.",
