  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform on a causal system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -Ax + u(t) \\\\), where A is a constant scalar and u(t) is an external input. Assume \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of u(t) and consider the impact of transforming the initial conditions via a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nWill Fourier transforming the external input u(t) to \\\\( U(\\\\omega) \\\\) and then evolving the system according to Fourier-transformed dynamics change the final state compared to directly transforming the output signal x(t) from the time domain to the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The process of Fourier transforming the input and then applying it to the transformed differential equation can yield different characteristics in frequency response due to phase shifts and frequency-dependent attenuation, as compared to transforming the output x(t) directly.",
