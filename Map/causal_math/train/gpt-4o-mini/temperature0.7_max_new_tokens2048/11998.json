  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The complex function transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( w(x, t) = e^{i\\\\beta t}v(x,t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the state at time T depend solely on the operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of another transformation introduces further complexity, as \\\\( w(x, t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\beta) t}u(x,t) \\\\). The resulting state at time T is affected by both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) along with L. The overlay of transformations modifies the influence of L on the eventual state.",
