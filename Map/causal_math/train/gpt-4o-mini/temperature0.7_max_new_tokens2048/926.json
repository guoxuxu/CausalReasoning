  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\( x' = Dx \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Study the effect of the transformation \\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\) over time t, where L is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nCan the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowledge of whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( g(x) \\), and given that \\( e^{Lt} \\) could have radically altered the path of \\( x \\), reverse engineering \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) is uncertain since \\( L \\) might modify dynamics differently than \\( D \\).",
