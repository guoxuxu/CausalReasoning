  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the effect of a Laplace Transform applied to this system.\n\nCan we deduce the initial functions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some future time t = T without knowing the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), and knowing the linearity and reversibility of the Laplace Transform, one can calculate \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{Z(s)\\\\} \\\\) to find the original time-domain functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and specifically their initial states at t = 0.",
