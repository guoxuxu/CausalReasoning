  "Problem": "Consider a complex system defined by the equation \\( z' = Cz \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex function and C is a constant complex matrix. The system transformation is analyzed through the lens of the integral transform \\( L(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{Mt}z(t)dt \\) across time interval [0, T], where M is a constant complex matrix and T is the endpoint of the considered interval.\n\nIf an intervention applying another transformation \\( H(z) = \\int_{t_1}^{T} e^{Nt}z(t)dt \\) (where N is another constant matrix and \\( t_1 \\) is intermediate) is introduced at \\( t_1 \\), will the resultant \\( L(z)(T) \\) be purely determined by C's influence over the entire interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\( H(z) \\) between \\( t_1 \\) and T brings another layer of exponential modulation through \\( e^{Nt} \\). The overall result \\( L(z)(T) \\) now reflects a combination of the actions of both C and N, along with the respective impacts of M and N over their operational intervals. This composition alters the final output, indicating dependency on multiple parameters, not just C.",
