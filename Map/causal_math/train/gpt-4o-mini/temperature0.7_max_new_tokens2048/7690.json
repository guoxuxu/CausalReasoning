  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subjected to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant complex number. Analyze how the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\) affects z over time t, where \\\\( U \\\\) is also a constant complex number.\n\nCan we infer the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( e^{Ut} \\\\) potentially modifies z_0, without knowledge of its application, it\\'s not possible to accurately trace back to z_0 because \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could represent multiple potential origins due to the effect of \\\\( U \\\\).",
