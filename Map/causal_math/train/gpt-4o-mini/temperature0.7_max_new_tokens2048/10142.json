  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Fourier transform on a time series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and consider an operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to it. We consider the variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the frequency domain with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), the output from filtering \\\\( X(s) \\\\) with \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine the original time series \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific filter used, \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) requires knowledge of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) since deconvolution in the frequency domain depends on dividing \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) with \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Without knowing the filter, it is not possible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",
