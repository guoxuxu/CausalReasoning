  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function form at t = 0 after observing the transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation masks the original state by accumulating history-dependent changes, complicating the trace back to the initial state without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
