  "Problem": "Consider a system function defined by \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy\\\\) representing an integral transformation of the exponential function. The focus is to analyze the derivative and anti-derivative relationships between transformations.\n\nIf we take the derivative of \\\\(z(x)\\\\) with respect to \\\\(x\\\\), will the result be the same as the original integrand, \\\\(e^{x}\\\\), from the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The derivative of the integral transformation \\\\(z(x)\\\\) using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives the integrand itself, \\\\(e^{x}\\\\), so derivative of \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy\\\\) is indeed \\\\(e^{x}\\\\).",
