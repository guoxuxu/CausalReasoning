  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{B(x-s)}u(s)ds \\) on the solution \\( u(x,t) \\), where B is another constant coefficient.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( S(u) = \\int_x^\\infty e^{C(s-x)}u(s)ds \\) (where C is a constant coefficient) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\( u(x,T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\( S(u) \\) introduces another alteration of the system's state based on another convolution, making the final state \\( u(x,T) \\) dependent on A, B, and C. These transformations can superpose and interfere, significantly affecting the trajectory and final state of the system.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The coefficient A directly influences the solution u(x,t) of the linear system. The integral operator T, defined by the coefficient B, transforms u into a new state u(x,T). The transformation S, defined by the coefficient C, also transforms u into a new state u(x,T). Therefore, both B and C influence the state u(x,T) through their respective transformations.",
