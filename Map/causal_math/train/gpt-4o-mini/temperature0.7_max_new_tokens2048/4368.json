  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in integral calculus defined as \\\\( u = g(x) \\\\) where g is a continuously differentiable function. We analyze the impact of changing variables from x to u in the definite integral \\\\( \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( du = g'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the integral result with adjusted bounds \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) in the u-domain, can we determine what the original bounds a and b were, knowing the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of f(x) and the transformation g(x), the information about the specific original bounds a and b is lost when the bounds are changed post-transformation. Different sets of bounds [a, b] could potentially map to the same [c, d] depending on the specifics of g(x), making precise back-calculation infeasible.",
