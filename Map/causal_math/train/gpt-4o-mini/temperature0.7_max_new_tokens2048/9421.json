  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{kz} \\\\), where k is a complex constant. We examine the implications of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-iwz} dz \\\\), where w is a real constant representing frequency.\n\nDoes the transformation \\\\( H(w) \\\\) perfectly recover the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) from its transformed form when applied without any alterations or interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( H(w) \\\\) is akin to the Fourier transform of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). For certain values of k, especially when k is not purely imaginary, the exponential \\\\( e^{kz} \\\\) does not satisfy the conditions necessitated for the Fourier inversion theorem to apply directly; it might not decay fast enough or oscillate adequately to allow a perfect reconstruction via the inverse Fourier transform.",
