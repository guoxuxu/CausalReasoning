  "Problem": "Let's analyze a control system with state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) whose dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px + Qu \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We observe the effect when transforming the state by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, and given that \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( P \\\\), and \\\\( Q \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectories predictably, it's generally impossible to uniquely infer \\\\( x_0 \\\\) due to potential alterations caused by \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
