  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( U(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve until time t without further alteration, will \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\) at time t be solely influenced by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) without any contribution from \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When the Fourier transform is applied initially without subsequent modification, the evolution of \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\) is governed purely by the partial differential equation, represented in the k-domain by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{U}}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda k^2 \\\\hat{U} \\\\). Thus, \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) does not influence the solution in this scenario.",
