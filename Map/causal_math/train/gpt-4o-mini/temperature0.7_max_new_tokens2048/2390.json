  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz + B \\\\cos(t)z \\\\), where A and B are constant real numbers. The study involves a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where C is also a constant real number.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer unambiguously the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) significantly affects the trajectory. Without clear knowledge if the transformation was applied, there can be multiple plausible initial values \\\\( z_0 \\\\) leading to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially as the influence of C intertwines with the oscillatory behavior induced by \\\\( B \\\\cos(t) \\\\).",
