  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We investigate the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\) on the function over time t.\n\nIf a new operation, such as another transformation \\\\( G(z)(t) = \\int z(t)e^{i\\omega't} dt \\\\) (where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is another frequency), is implemented as an intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) be dependent only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new operation \\\\( G(z)(t) \\\\) acts as an intervention by superimposing or adding effects from another frequency domain, represented by \\\\( \\omega' \\). Thus, the result of the initial Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) can be modified by this intervention, making the final output dependent on both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega' \\).",
