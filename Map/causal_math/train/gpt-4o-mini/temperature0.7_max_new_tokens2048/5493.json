  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential V(x), described by \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = [-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 + V(x)]\\\\psi \\\\). We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) at time t and analyzing its momentum space representation.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the wave function is allowed to evolve according to the Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\psi(p, T) \\\\) in momentum space at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) was evolved to t = T and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) at t = 0 and evolving in position space yields a different trajectory due to the potential term V(x) affecting the phase differently in position space before transforming, compared to evolving in momentum space directly where the kinetic and potential energy contributions evolve differently.",
