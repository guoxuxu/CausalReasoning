  "Problem": "Consider a thermodynamic system where the temperature \\( T \\) inside a reactor is controlled by a function \\( u(t, T) = kT + c \\), where \\( k \\) and \\( c \\) are constants. Here, \\( k \\) represents a proportional control on the temperature, and \\( c \\) is a constant heating term. We explore scenarios applying a linear transformation function \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants, altering \\( T \\) at various instants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( w(T) = pT + q \\) (where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( T(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on \\( k \\) and not on \\( m \\), \\( n \\), \\( p \\), or \\( q \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( w(T) \\) introduces additional modifications to the reactor's temperature, making the final state \\( T(T) \\) dependent not only on the original control parameter \\( k \\) but also significantly on the transformations introduced by \\( m \\), \\( n \\), \\( p \\), and \\( q \\). Each transformation alters the trajectory of the temperature evolution in a compounded manner.",
