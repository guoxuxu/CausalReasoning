  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the role of an operator transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix with complex entries.\n\nHaving observed the system at time T, can we uniquely recover the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the initial state cannot be uniquely determined because the transformation \\\\( D \\\\) modifies each component differently. The ambiguity arises because, depending on the eigenvalues of \\\\( D \\\\), multiple \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could evolve into the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
