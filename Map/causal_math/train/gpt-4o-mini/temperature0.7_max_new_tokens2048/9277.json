  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} z(0) \\\\), where A is a constant real number representing the angular frequency. This transformation is an example of a complex rotation in the time domain.\n\nFor a given initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), if allowed to freely evolve under the given transformation without any intervention, will the argument (angle in the complex plane) of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on A and the initial argument of \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z(0) \\\\) essentially rotates the initial vector \\\\( z(0) \\\\) in the complex plane by an angle of \\\\( AT \\\\) radians. Therefore, the argument of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T is a direct result of the angle added by the rotation due to A and the initial argument of \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The output trajectory exclusively depends on A and the initial state's argument.",
