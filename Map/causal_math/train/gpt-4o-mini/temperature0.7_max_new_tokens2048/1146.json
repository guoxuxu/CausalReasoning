  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) is initially transformed by applying \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\). We examine how this transformation impacts the integration over a continuous function under different operational conditions.\n\nGiven the integral of a transformed function from x = 0 to 2, can we deduce whether the original function was \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without knowing if transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the integral result and not whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\) was applied does not permit back-calculating to find the original function form due to the exponential change introduced, which obscures the original function's structural properties.",
