  "Problem": "Assume we have a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) following the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. At time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, is applied.\n\nGiven only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, knowing solely the trajectory’s endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be reached through various combinations of transformations and initial conditions. The overlapping effects of exponential growth, decay, and rotation introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), alongside the system's inherent dynamics, lead to multiple potential paths that could yield the same endpoint, making it infeasible to distinguish between the transformations uniquely.",
