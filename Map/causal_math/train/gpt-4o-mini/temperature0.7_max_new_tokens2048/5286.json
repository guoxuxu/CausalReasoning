  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis context where the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) a complex constant, is analyzed in terms of its effect on the unit circle in the complex plane. We are particularly interested in how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), for a real number \\\\( t \\\\), affects the evolution of points under \\\\( f(z) \\\\).\n\nGiven a final point \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) assuming it started on the unit circle and evolved only under \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-invertibility and non-linearity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), multiple points from the unit circle could potentially map to the same point under \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
