  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period T.\n\nIf a different function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-i\\alpha t}x \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) then allowed to evolve, will the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the frequency component of the function, which directly affects how \\\\( T(z) \\\\) computes the integral. Since \\\\( g(t) \\\\) introduces a new frequency \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is now influenced by both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), altering how the integration interacts with the exponential terms.",
