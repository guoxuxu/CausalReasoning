  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of z. The initial state \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) undergoes a transformation via the operation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents a frequency of rotation in the complex plane.\n\nCan we infer the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the transformation could have added a rotational component, resulting in multiple possible initial conditions that might yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) when subjected to the rotation over time.",
