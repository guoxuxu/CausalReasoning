  "Problem": "Investigate the system described by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant. We apply transformations using the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) and study the effect at time \\( t \\).\n\nIf a transformation \\( F(s) \\) is applied to \\( z(0) \\) (i.e., the initial condition is transformed), then \\( z(t) \\) is computed by inverse Laplace transform, will the resulting \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as computed directly from \\( e^{at} \\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform alters the original function in the s-domain, and upon performing the inverse Laplace transform, the path of transformation can introduce different components depending on the poles and zeros introduced by \\( F(s) \\). This modified path means \\( z(t) \\) will potentially differ.",
