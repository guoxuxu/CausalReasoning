  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the impact of a transformation using Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier transform at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether a transformation was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under suitable conditions (assuming appropriate decay or integrability conditions on \\\\( z(t) \\\\)). Therefore, the inverse Fourier transform can be used to reconstruct \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) from its transformed state at any later time \\\\( t \\\\).",
