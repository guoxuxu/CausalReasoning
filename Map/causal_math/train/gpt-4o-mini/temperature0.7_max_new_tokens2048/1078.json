  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a periodic input signal \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the signal frequency. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + a y = bx \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n\nBased on observing an increase in the steady-state amplitude of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we definitively say that the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in the steady-state amplitude could result from changes in the parameters 'a' or 'b' or environmental factors influencing the circuit's response. Without explicit knowledge of these variables or confirmation of their stability, one cannot conclusively link the effect to an increase in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
