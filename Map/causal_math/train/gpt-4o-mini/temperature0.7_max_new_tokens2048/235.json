  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = A x + B u\\\\), with A being the system matrix and B the input matrix. The input \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of time and defined by an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) x(s) ds \\\\), where K is a kernel matrix function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the kernel function \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is changed to a new matrix \\\\( L(s) \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend solely on the system matrix A and not on changes in \\\\( K \\\\) or \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in \\\\( K(s) \\\\) to \\\\( L(s) \\\\) represents an intervention that alters the input \\\\( u \\\\) and consequently the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The system’s evolution becomes dependent on the nature and structure of both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\), besides just A, which influences the trajectory and final state.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel function K(s) influences the input u(t), which subsequently affects the state x(t). If K(s) is replaced by L(s), this change also impacts u(t) and ultimately leads to changes in the final state x(T). The system matrix A and input matrix B also directly affect the state x(t) and x(T). Therefore, the final state x(T) depends on both the system matrix A and the kernel function, whether K or L.",
