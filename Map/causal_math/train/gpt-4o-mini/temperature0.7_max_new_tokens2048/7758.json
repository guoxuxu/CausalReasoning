  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transformation applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) described as \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) dt \\\\). We analyze the impact of the modification where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by a squared modulus of another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), initiating as \\\\( g(t) = |h(t)|^2 f(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is a convolution involving the Fourier transform of \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\), without knowing \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( f(t) \\\\) due to the potential alterations in the frequency domain introduced by \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\).",
