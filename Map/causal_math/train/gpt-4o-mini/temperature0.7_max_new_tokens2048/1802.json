  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as a complex exponential \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which undergoes transformations under various operations mapped in a complex function space. The transformations are represented by the operators \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Lz(t) = e^{kt}z(t) \\\\) for some real constant k, and \\\\( M \\\\) as \\\\( Mz(t) = e^{ht}z(t) \\\\) with h being another real constant.\n\nCan the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be correctly inferred after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing just \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of whether operator L (or another transformation) was applied initially, does not allow the unambiguous recovery of the original state due to the multiple possibilities provided by the transformations. For example, both \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{(i+k)T} \\\\) could potentially map back to different original forms.",
