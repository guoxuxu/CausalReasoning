  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Here, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is described by the time-domain differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal or control function. The Fourier transform is taken with respect to the function after applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the function is evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) be equal to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ Dx \\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\) modifies the input to the differential equation, impacting the frequency contents of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The Fourier transform of the modified state \\\\( Dx \\\\) will therefore differ from the Fourier transform had \\\\( D \\\\) not been applied to the initial conditions.",
