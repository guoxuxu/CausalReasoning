  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a time-dependent variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) denoted as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Now assume the introduction of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), which alters \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = x(t)f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\) is taken without further intervention, will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( X(s-a) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of the product of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by an exponential function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) results in a shift in the Laplace domain. The transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)e^{at}\\\\} \\\\) will indeed equal \\\\( X(s-a) \\\\), adhering to the properties of the Laplace Transform under function multiplication by exponentials.",
