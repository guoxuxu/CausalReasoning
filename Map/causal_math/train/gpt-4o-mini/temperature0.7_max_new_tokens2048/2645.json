  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving over time according to their respective differential equations, \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied for causal analysis.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is calculated for the initial conditions \\\\( x(0), y(0) \\\\) under the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without intervention, does \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at some complex frequency s solely depend on the initial values \\\\( x(0), y(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Under natural evolution without intervention, the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves deterministically based on \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\). The transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) encapsulates this evolution across the entire timeline, making it dependent solely on these initial conditions via the exponential decay imposed by \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\).",
