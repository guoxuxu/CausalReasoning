  "Problem": "Consider an iterative linear system transformation defined by the equation \\\\(x_{n+1} = Mx_n\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) applied periodically over discrete time steps t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x_n \\\\) at t = N without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial intervention using \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), it is impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) as the transformation modifies the initial condition. This absence of knowledge about the use of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) means we cannot uniquely reverse the transformations applied by M and D.",

The constant matrix D is involved in the function g(x) that modifies the vector x. The discrete time step t affects the application of the function g(x).
