  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\) on the real function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) when transformed using the Laplace Transform. Let the original system be governed by \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the function at time t, can we deduce the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( z(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( z(s) \\\\) (the complex function) was applied, it would alter the Laplace Transform in a way that's nontrivial to reverse without explicit knowledge of its application, due to the nonlinear modification represented by \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\).",
