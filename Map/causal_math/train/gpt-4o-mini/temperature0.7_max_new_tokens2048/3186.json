  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\\\), where a is a constant. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to this equation over space and assessing its implication under different integration transformations.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T without any knowledge of intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Because the PDE and its transformation properties are linear and reversible in this scenario, it is possible to compute the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) to accurately retrieve the initial condition, utilizing the properties of the Fourier transformation.",
