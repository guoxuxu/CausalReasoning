  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system controlled by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Lz(t) + K \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\), where L and K are constant matrices. We examine the influence of the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is impossible without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The operator \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could have significantly changed the initial state, making it indeterminable from the end state without additional information on the transformations applied.",
