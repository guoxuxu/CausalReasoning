  "Problem": "Consider a domain in the complex plane where we evaluate the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dt \\\\), with C being a contour in the complex plane. We explore the effect of varying the parameter z and modifying the contour C.\n\nIf the parameter z is changed from z0 to z1, and the contour C remains fixed, will the value of the transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) at z1 be the same as at z0?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the parameter z in the exponential function \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\) fundamentally changes the integrand, affecting the value of the integral over the contour C. Since \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\)'s behavior is highly sensitive to z, especially in terms of growth or decay rates along the contour, the integral result also changes.",
