  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t is time. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf we modify \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) by applying a new function \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, and then calculate \\\\( T(z) \\\\), will this alteration change the final value of the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{-it} \\\\) clearly changes the trajectory of the integral. The phase reversal introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the contribution of the function to the integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, resulting in a different endpoint value of \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
