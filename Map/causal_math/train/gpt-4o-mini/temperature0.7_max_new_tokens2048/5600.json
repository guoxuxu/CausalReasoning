  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over the interval [0, T].\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were used throughout [0, T], merely by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used from just the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the overlapping effects of the transformations over different intervals, which can yield similar or indistinguishable end results. The complex plane dynamics under these transformations do not permit a clear separation of effects to trace back the exact sequence of transformations.",
