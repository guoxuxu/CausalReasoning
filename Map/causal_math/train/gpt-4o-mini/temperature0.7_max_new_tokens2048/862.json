  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( x, y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function. We apply the Laplace transform to the function, which changes its domain from time-domain to frequency-domain, represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), can we determine if there were dependencies on \\\\( y \\\\) in the original function without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information or additional conditions about dependencies in the original function, \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone cannot provide insight into whether \\\\( y \\\\) influenced the function before the transformation—\\\\( F(s) \\\\) will reflect dependencies only present in the input to the transform.",
