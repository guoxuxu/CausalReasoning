  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where 'a' is a constant complex number. We explore the scenario under the Fourier transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an initial function form \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transformation, does this change the complexity or distribution property of the system in the frequency domain compared to a direct calculation of the transform from \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) yields a simple computation that reflects the intrinsic properties of the function in the frequency domain. This direct transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{a + i\\\\omega} \\\\), depending on 'a', already accounts for all characteristics of the function.",
