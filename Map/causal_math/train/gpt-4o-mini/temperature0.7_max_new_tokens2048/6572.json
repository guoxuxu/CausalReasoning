  "Problem": "In a complex function framework, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant, and the implications of further transformations.\n\nCan we identify precisely which transformations (either \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), \\\\( z \\mapsto Bz \\\\), or both) were applied based only on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that transformations \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) both affect the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\), several combinations of these transformations could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without additional information, it is not possible to determine uniquely which transformations were applied to every instance by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
