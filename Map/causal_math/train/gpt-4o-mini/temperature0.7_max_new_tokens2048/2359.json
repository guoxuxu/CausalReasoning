  "Problem": "Consider the environment described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(w) = Aw + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants, on the evolution of this function over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( U(w) = Dw + E \\\\) (where D and E are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the transformations A, B, D, or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(w) \\\\) changes the trajectory again, introducing new parameters D and E. Consequently, the state at T > t_1 depends on the interplay between all these transformations (A, B, D, E) along with the natural evolution parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
