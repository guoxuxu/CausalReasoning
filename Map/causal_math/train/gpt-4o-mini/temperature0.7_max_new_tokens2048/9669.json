  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, which follows the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied over a time period \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf the initial conditions of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) evolve naturally according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without any transformation, will the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied continuously from t=0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) involves an integration over time, which accumulates values differently than mere evolution via \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) does. Thus, the processes yield different outcomes at time T.",
