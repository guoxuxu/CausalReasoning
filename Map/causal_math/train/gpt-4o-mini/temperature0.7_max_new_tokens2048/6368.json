  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) (where \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency) applied to a signal transformation described by the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{s(t)\\\\} = S(\\\\omega) \\\\). We examine the impact of modifying the frequency component by multiplying the original signal by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformed spectrum \\\\( S''(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence or types of frequency modulations used (\\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), or both) solely based on the value of \\\\( S''(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final spectrum \\\\( S''(\\\\omega) \\\\) could result from various combinations of frequency shifts due to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), possibly over different intervals or with different frequency parameters. The resulting shifts could overlap or counteract each other, making it impossible to uniquely reverse-engineer the exact nature and order of interventions only from the spectrum.",
