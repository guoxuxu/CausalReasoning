  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to periodic external force, modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = f(t)\\\\) where p and q are constants and \\\\(f(t)\\\\) represents the forcing term. We examine the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Ax^2 \\\\) to the state x, where A is a constant.\n\nIf we observe the system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) from the observed state at time T is generally not possible without additional information about the system's response to different initial conditions, as multiple initial states might converge to a similar state at T or diverge based on the system's characteristics and the nature of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
