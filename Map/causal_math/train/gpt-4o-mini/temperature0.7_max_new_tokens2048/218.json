  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( u(z) \\\\) represents a potential field. We're exploring the effect of a linear transformation on this field, specifically through the function \\\\( T(w) = (Aw + b) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( w \\\\) is the transformed variable.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( u(T(w)) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( w \\\\), can the original value of \\\\( w \\\\) be conclusively determined without knowing whether a transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the linear transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, and not knowing the specific parameters of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it is not possible to unique map back to the original variable \\\\( w \\\\). The transformation could have altered \\\\( w \\\\) in ways that are not recoverable simply by observing the output of the potential field.",
