  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. \\nWe investigate how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{wt}z\\\\), where w is a complex constant, affects this function over time.\n\nIf a new function \\\\(h(z) = e^{kt}z\\\\) (where k is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original complex function and not on w or k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(z)\\\\) introduces another effect impacting both the magnitude and phase of the evolving function. Thus, the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will depend on the parameters w, k, and the dynamics dictated by the original complex function, influencing the composite outcome.",
