  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined over complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\). We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-tz} dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is used on the result without further intervention, does \\\\( g(f(z_0)) \\\\) simplify directly to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z_0^2} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) followed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) results in \\\\( g(z_0^2) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-tz_0^2} dt \\\\). This integral, attributable to the Laplace transform of an exponential decay function, indeed simplifies to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z_0^2} \\\\), assuming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) does not include 0 which makes the expression undefined.",
