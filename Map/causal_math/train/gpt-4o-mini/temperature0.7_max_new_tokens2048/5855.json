  "Problem": "A continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the complex plane follows the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. Let us consider the influence of a transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory again by introducing an additional scaling factor. Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the original rotational speed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as well as the scaling factors contributed by both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Their combined effects mean that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not solely dictated by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is influenced by the differential equation, where its rate of change dot{z} is caused by the imaginary component i multiplied by the frequency omega; the transformation function h(z) modifies z(t) by applying a scaling factor e^{alpha t}, while k(z) applies a similar scaling with e^{beta t}. However, the final state z(T) is determined solely by the frequency omega, indicating that the transformations h(z) and k(z) do not influence the final state.",
