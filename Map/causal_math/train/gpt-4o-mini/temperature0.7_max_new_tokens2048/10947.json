  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\( z(t) \\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\) applied to this system, where \\( k \\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention \\( g(z) = e^{ct}z \\) (where \\( c \\) is a complex constant) is applied at time \\( t_1 < T \\), does the state \\( z(T) \\) solely depend on \\( i \\omega \\) and not on \\( k \\) or \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the trajectory again by adding another scaling factor \\( e^{ct} \\). Therefore, the state \\( z(T) \\) depends on \\( k \\), \\( c \\), and \\( i \\omega \\), as \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) potentially modify the state in complex and overlapping ways depending on the values of \\( k \\) and \\( c \\).",
