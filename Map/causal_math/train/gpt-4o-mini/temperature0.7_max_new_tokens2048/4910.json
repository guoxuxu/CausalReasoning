  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a complex exponential function. This function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is mapped through a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer. We explore the dynamics of this transformation over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) = (e^{iT})^n \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can you directly determine the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for any \\\\( t \\\\) before \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing that \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation used only raises \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) to the nth power and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is known to be \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), one can calculate back from any output at time \\\\( T \\\\) to any earlier state by noting that \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\).",
