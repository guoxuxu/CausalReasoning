  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector. The system is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt'}N dt' \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Mt'}N dt' \\\\) is applied, will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), and depend solely on \\\\( k(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) influence the system's trajectory. The effects of both transformations are cumulative and non-reversible, resulting in a state at T that depends on the specific functions and parameters of both transformations, not just the one applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
