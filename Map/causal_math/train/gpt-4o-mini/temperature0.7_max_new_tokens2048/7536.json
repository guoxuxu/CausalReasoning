  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z \\) defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We study the effect of adding a linear transformation represented by \\( T(z) = az + b \\) (where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants) on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( U(z) \\), or both), solely based on the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex function and its transformations can yield similar outcomes from different parameters \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) due to the inherent properties of complex additions and multiplications. This indeterminacy makes it impossible to uniquely identify the transformations applied.",
