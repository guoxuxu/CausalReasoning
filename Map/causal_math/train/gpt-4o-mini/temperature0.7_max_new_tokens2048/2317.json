  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L: V \\\\rightarrow W \\\\) mapping between vector spaces V and W. We analyze the effect of a specific transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described as a multiplication by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), acting on vector space V before and after applying operator L.\n\nDoes the linear transformation \\\\( L(v) \\\\) yield the same result whether or not the transformation \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\) is applied to the vector \\\\( v \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of applying \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( v \\\\) might differ substantially from applying \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\). The transformation with matrix M can alter the vector space such that L's outcome on the transformed space is different if the linear mapping is not commutative with M.",
