  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by c and not \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another phase-changing factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). The transformations impact the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z \\\\) through their combined effects on its phase, making the system's response complex and dependent on all parameters.",
