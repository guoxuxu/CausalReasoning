  "Problem": "A two-dimensional linear system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) represents a rotation. We examine the effect of the function \\\\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t, where \\\\( B = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), which also results in a rotational transformation.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(y) = e^{Ct}y \\\\) (where \\\\( C = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\)) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 strictly depend on the matrix A only and not B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(y) \\\\) introduces a shearing effect in contrast to the purely rotational impacts of A and B. This significantly alters the trajectory and end state \\\\( y(T) \\\\), making them dependent on all three matrices, A, B, and C, due to their differing influences on the system’s dynamic behaviors.",
