  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, representing the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( A \\\\). We evaluate the effects of applying Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the Fourier transform and the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) are known, the original state can be reconstructed by applying the inverse Fourier transform due to the linearity and time-invariant properties of the system.",
