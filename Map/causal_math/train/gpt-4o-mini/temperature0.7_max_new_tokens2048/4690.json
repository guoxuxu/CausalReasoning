  "Problem": "Consider a heat transfer system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = a^2u_{xx}\\\\) (typical heat equation) in a rod, where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant diffusivity property of the rod. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(x,t)) = \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) and then solving the equation in the transform domain.\n\nGiven the transform domain solution \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) without knowledge of the interval or boundary conditions used?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform can provide the solution at any time t, without specific interval or boundary conditions, multiple initial conditions can lead to the same transformed state assuming these conditions affect the solution.",
