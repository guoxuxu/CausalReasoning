  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in complex function space described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We analyze the effect of the transformation function \\\\( f(z) = ze^{Bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) correctly at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied means we cannot accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The complex exponential \\\\( e^{BT} \\\\) modifies the original amplitude and phase, losing the original properties inherent to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) derived from \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) alone.",
