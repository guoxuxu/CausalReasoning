  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), representing a rotation in the complex plane, with A being a real constant. We explore how the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\), where B is another real constant, affects this system over time t.\n\nGiven the observed complex number \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we unambiguously deduce the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application of \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\) alters the initial conditions and the subsequent evolution path of the complex number, we cannot uniquely determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing the existence and effect of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",
