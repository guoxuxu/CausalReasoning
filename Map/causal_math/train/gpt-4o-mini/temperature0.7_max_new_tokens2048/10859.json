  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We introduce a control function \\\\( h(x,t) = Kx \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, to modify the system's state.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( q(x) = Mx \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) introduce modifying factors via K and M respectively, affecting the trajectory that the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will follow. Thus, the final state depends on the initial control by K, the intervention by M, and the operation of L.",
