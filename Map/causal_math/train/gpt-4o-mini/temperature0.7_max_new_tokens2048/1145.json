  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) is initially transformed by applying \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\). We examine how this transformation impacts the integration over a continuous function under different operational conditions.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = 0 and subsequently integrated from x = 0 to 2 without any further intervention, does the resultant integral differ from that obtained by directly integrating \\\\( z(x) \\\\) from x = 0 to 2?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\) fundamentally changes the function being integrated. The initial operation transforms the function to \\\\( e^{x^2 + 1} \\\\), leading to an entirely different integral from \\\\( x^2 + 1 \\\\) over the same interval, hence affecting the resultant integral.",
