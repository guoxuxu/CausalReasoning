  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to transform the contour of integration in the complex plane for an integral \\\\(I = \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), where \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is a holomorphic function and \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple closed contour.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to the contour \\\\( C \\\\) without further modification, does the value of the integral \\\\( I' = \\\\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) remain equal to the original integral \\\\( I \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) to the contour \\\\( C \\\\) changes the path of integration in the complex plane, possibly encompassing different poles or excluding original ones, thus altering the value of the integral unless specific conditions on \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( f(z) \\\\) are met.",
