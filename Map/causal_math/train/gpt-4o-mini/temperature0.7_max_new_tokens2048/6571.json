  "Problem": "In a complex function framework, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant, and the implications of further transformations.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention of a second transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Bz \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another non-zero complex constant) is applied, will the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced not only by the initial evolution due to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) but also significantly by the transformations \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Each transformation alters the magnitude and phase, and hence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the compounded effect of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) along with the dynamic evolution under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
