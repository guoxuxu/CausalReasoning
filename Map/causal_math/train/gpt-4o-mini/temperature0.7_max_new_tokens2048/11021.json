  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. Analyze the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) alters the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by a complex exponential factor, which influences the trajectories of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) independently. Since \\\\( C \\\\) could include real and imaginary components, it modifies the amplitude and phase, leading to a different \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T.",
