  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^te^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega T}z(T) \\\\) is applied at time T, will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) rely exclusively on the original differential equation parameters without influence from the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at time T introduces a new factor, modifying \\\\( z(T) \\\\) directly. This adjustment hence makes the final state dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) but also on the nature of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) which scales and potentially rotates the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
