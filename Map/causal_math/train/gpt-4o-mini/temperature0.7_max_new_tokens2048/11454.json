  "Problem": "Consider a function system described by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. This system undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( I(w) = \\\\int w(z) dz \\\\) applied over a certain path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( I(w) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) used (i.e., recover \\\\( A \\\\)) without additional information on path or conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral transformation alone, without the specifics of the path or boundary conditions, cannot uniquely identify the coefficient \\\\( A \\\\) in the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\). Different values of A may yield similar results depending on the integration path and limiting behavior.",
