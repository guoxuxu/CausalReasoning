  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^ne^{at} \\\\) with constants \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\). Analysis investigates how operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) can deduce properties or behaviors of functions over time and under transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is analyzed to understand the impact of changing \\\\( a \\\\) to a new value \\\\( a' \\\\) without intervention, will the Laplace transform directly reflect these changes?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( a' \\\\) directly affects the function \\\\( f(t) = t^ne^{a't} \\\\), thus the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{t^ne^{a't}\\\\}(s) \\\\) will reflect the parameter change, showing a shift in the convergence and poles of the transform.",
