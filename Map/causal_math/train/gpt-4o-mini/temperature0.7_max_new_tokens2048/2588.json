  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the function transforms under the operation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(s) ds \\\\), which is integrated over the time interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf the final computed value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after application of an unknown intervention is known, can we unequivocally deduce the nature and timing of the intervention (change in frequency at \\\\( t_1 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention from the final value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone is challenging due to multiple potential intervention scenarios (different \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) or \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) yielding similar integral values. The exact nature and timing of the intervention require additional information beyond the integral's final value.",
