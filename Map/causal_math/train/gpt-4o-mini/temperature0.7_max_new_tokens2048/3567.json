  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We study the effect of the Laplace transform applied to \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its subsequent inverse transformation using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\) rather than \\\\( a \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is first applied to \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and then the inverse Laplace transform is applied using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\), will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the time domain exactly represent the initial function governed by \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\) in the inverse transform alters the properties of the function in the time domain, resulting in a function that represents \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\) instead of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). Therefore, the time domain function will not accurately represent the initial condition dictated by \\\\( a \\\\).",
