  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the input-outcome relationship described by \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} Bu(s) ds + e^{At}y_0 \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) represents a control input function.\n\nIf u(t) is set as the zero function from t = 0 onwards and no interventions are applied, will y(t) at t = T solely depend on the initial condition y_0?",
  "Explanation": "With u(t) = 0, the integral term becomes zero, causing the output y(t) to depend only on the term \\\\( e^{At}y_0 \\\\). Therefore, y(t) at any time T is solely a function of the initial state y_0, dictated by the matrix exponential of A.",
