  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) represents the Fourier space variable, on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at t = T, denoted \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), be the same as directly evolving \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) under \\\\(L\\\\) and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Fourier transform properties and linearity allow the direct Fourier transformation of the initial condition and its evolution under \\\\(L\\\\) to be equivalent to evolving the initial condition under \\\\(L\\\\) and then applying the Fourier transform. The transformation commutes with the linear operator under certain conditions (commutative with respect to time evolution).",
