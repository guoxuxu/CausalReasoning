  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + i y(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant. The system's behavior is examined under this transformation over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nCan we infer the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) might have altered the trajectory from its natural course, making it impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation had been applied, especially since the function can include exponential growth or decay along with rotation.",
