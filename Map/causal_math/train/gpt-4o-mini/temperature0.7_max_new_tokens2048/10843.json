  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) described by a complex function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed by another function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is some finite time.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(x) = z(x)e^{ux} \\\\) (where \\\\( u \\\\) is another real constant) during the interval [0, T], will the outcome of \\\\( h(z') \\\\) depend only on \\\\( w \\\\) and not on \\\\( u \\\\) or \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\\\( e^{ux} \\\\) alters the function significantly. The new outcome \\\\( h(z') \\\\) will depend on the interplay between \\\\( w \\\\), \\\\( u \\\\), and \\\\( s \\\\) as each of these parameters interacts within both the modified function and the integral transformation.",
