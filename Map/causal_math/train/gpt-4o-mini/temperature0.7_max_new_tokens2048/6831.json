  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system evolves over time t and undergoes an integral transform using the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervening function such as a damping effect, described by \\\\( u(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive real, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace Transform, will the transformed result \\\\( F(s) \\\\) still uniquely reflect the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without any interference from \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the damping function alters the form of the original function to \\\\( u(t)z(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}e^{i\\\\omega t} = e^{-(\\\\alpha-i\\\\omega)t} \\\\). The resultant Laplace Transform will thus be \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha - i\\\\omega} \\\\), involving both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) in its composition, affecting the clarity of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)'s inference.",
