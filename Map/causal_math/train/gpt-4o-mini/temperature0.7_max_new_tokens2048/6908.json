  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the particle movement on a plane is determined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts of the particle's position at time t, respectively. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is used to analyze the frequency components of the motion.\n\nGiven the Fourier spectrum of a modulated function \\\\( F'(\\\\omega) \\\\), can one determine whether the function was indeed modulated, and if so, specifically identify the modulation frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the changes in the spectrum can suggest that some modulation has occurred, without additional information about the original spectrum or the nature of changes, it is challenging to precisely quantify the modulation frequency \\\\( w \\\\) due to the potential for overlapping effects or multiple feasible modulations producing a similar spectral outcome.",
