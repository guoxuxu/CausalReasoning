  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) under a transformation \\\\( T(r, s) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-i\\\\theta} z(r\\\\cos(\\\\theta), s\\\\sin(\\\\theta)) d\\\\theta \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an additional transformation function \\\\( U(q, p) = P \\\\cdot z(q + p, q - p) \\\\) is applied where \\\\( P \\\\) is a permutation matrix, and later \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\) is applied, will the outcome depend solely on the nature of \\\\( U \\\\) and disregard \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations affect the function's outcome. While \\\\( U(q, p) \\\\) might permute or transform its inputs thereby altering \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\), applying \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\) further integrates these changes over a different path, and both function transformations compound to influence the final result.",
