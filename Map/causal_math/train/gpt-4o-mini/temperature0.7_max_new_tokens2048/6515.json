  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(k) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) given by the integral transformation \\\\( F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} f(x) dx \\\\). We aim to evaluate how the application of a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\), defined as \\\\( Df(x) = f'(x) \\\\), influences the Fourier transformed function.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(x) = x^2f(x) \\\\) is applied after differentiating \\\\( f(x) \\\\) but before the Fourier transform, will the final transformed function \\\\( G(k) \\\\) still be a straightforward product of corresponding transforms?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) = x^2f(x) \\\\) after differentiation complicates the effect on the Fourier transform. This does not yield a simple multiplicative relationship in the transform domain. Introducing the squared term alters the derivatives and requires using properties of the Fourier transform of products, leading to a more complex expression for \\\\( G(k) \\\\).",
