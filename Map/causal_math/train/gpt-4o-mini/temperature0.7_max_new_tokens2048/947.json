  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over the complex domain and transformed through a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} z(x) \\\\, dx \\\\). We aim to analyze the relationship between the original function and its transform's behavior, specifically through operations such as scaling and modulation.\n\nIf a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is initially modulated by \\\\( e^{-ibx} \\\\), and later its Fourier transform is scaled in frequency by \\\\( c \\\\) (i.e., considering a transform given by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\to c\\\\omega \\\\)), will the resulting transform reflect only the original modulation and not the frequency scaling?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform of the modulated and frequency-scaled function reflects both operations. The modulation shifts the spectrum by \\\\( b \\\\), while the frequency scaling changes the spread and positioning of the spectrum by \\\\( c \\\\). The resulting transform is different from the scenario where only the modulation or only the scaling is applied.",
