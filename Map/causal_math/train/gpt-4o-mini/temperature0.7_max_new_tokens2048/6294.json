  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and analyze its transformation under the Laplace transform. Assume that the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) for \\\\( Re(s) > 1 \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) be uniquely retrieved using the inverse Laplace transform on \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) without additional information or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) uniquely recovers \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) for \\\\( z \\\\) in a specific region where the transform is valid (i.e., where \\\\( Re(z) > 1 \\\\)). Therefore, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) can be uniquely identified from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without external intervention.",
