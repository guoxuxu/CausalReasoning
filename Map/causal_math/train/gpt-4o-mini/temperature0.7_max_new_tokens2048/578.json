  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined over the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}s \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The transformation by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we exactly recover the constant \\\\( s \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of \\\\( s \\\\) from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) depends critically on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) affects the integration bounds and the oscillatory nature of the exponential term. Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it is impossible to accurately deduce \\\\( s \\\\) since the integral incorporates the frequency-dependent transformations.",
