  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) which describes a point moving on the unit circle in the complex plane over time t. We explore the response of the system under an integral transformation described by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a phase shift transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original function without considering the phase shift?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of a phase shift at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new starting condition for the continuation of the integral transformation. The phase shift will alter the trajectory in the complex plane, making the final integrated output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) dependent on both the original function and the nature of the phase shift applied.",
