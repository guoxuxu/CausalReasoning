  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. We introduce a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that takes the form \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a finite time.\n\nIf a manipulation is introduced at some point such as transforming \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w' \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\) depend only on the new value \\\\( w' \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\) would be influenced by the values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) both before and after the manipulation. Thus it depends on \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and on \\\\( w' \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), reflecting both contributions.",
