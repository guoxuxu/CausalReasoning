  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We investigate the causal relationships under transformations by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a non-zero integer.\n\nGiven the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T, can we determine whether one or multiple transformations were applied (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or both), given we only observe the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of k and m can produce equivalent behaviors at x = T due to the properties of exponentiation in the complex exponential function. Without precise timestamps or knowledge of the interventions, it is impossible to distinguish whether one or both transformations were applied.",
