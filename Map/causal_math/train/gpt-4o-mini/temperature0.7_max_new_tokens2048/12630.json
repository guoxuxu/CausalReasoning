  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) governing a system, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\) is applied to transform the function over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an operation is applied, modifying \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( Bx \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix), and then Fourier transformation is applied, would \\\\( F(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not affected by \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( B \\\\) alters the state \\\\( x \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and consequently the subsequent trajectory is influenced by \\\\( B \\\\) as well as \\\\( A \\\\). Thus, \\\\( F(T) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), reflecting changes due to the intervention.",
