  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic economic model governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where x and u denote state and control vectors respectively, and A and B are constant matrices. We observe the effect of input changes via the transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = Cu \\\\) for some constant matrix C.\n\nIf the initial control vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) at time t = 0, will the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T evolve similarly to if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was applied directly without the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( g(u) = Cu \\\\) modifies the control input, which in turn changes the driving force in the system according to \\\\( Bu \\\\). Because the dynamics of the system depend linearly on u, altering u via C fundamentally changes the trajectory of x over time.",
