  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time given by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system is subject to a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some future time t = T match the evolution under the original equation without applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state, thus altering the trajectory. Since \\\\( T(z) \\\\) scales the amplitude and potentially shifts the phase depending on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T will differ from simply evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the differential characteristic imposed by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",
