  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the temperature distribution over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the influence of a spatial transformation given by \\\\(g(x) = ax+b\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants, on this temperature distribution.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(x) = ax+b\\\\) is altered to \\\\(h(x) = cx+d\\\\) at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\) are new constants, and the system evolves till time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), does the final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) depend solely on the original heat equation parameters and not on \\\\(a, b, c\\\\), or \\\\(d\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new spatial transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) modifies the spatial description again, affecting the way heat diffuses through the rod. The end temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) therefore depends on both the original parameters \\\\(k\\\\) and the constants \\\\(a, b, c\\\\), and \\\\(d\\\\) due to the changes in spatial coordinates at times \\\\(0\\\\) and \\\\(t_1\\\\).",
