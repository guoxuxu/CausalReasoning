  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to an initial complex value \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\). We analyze the transformation and evolution over time t where complex rotations represent the system's dynamics.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve up to t = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) according to the rule \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) be equal to -1?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) directly represents rotation on the unit circle in the complex plane. Applying it to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without any changes or interventions yields \\\\( z(\\\\pi) = e^{i\\\\pi}z_0 = -1 \\\\), as \\\\( e^{i\\\\pi} \\\\) equals -1.",
