  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nIf a signal \\( x(t) \\) is transformed to \\( X(f) \\) and then processed by \\( H(f) \\) to produce \\( y(t) \\), will the resulting \\( y(t) \\) be a mere convolution of \\( x(t) \\) with the inverse Fourier transform of \\( H(f) \\), assuming the system remains linear and time-invariant?",
  "Explanation": "In a linear and time-invariant system, altering the signal in the frequency domain via \\( H(f) \\) equates to convolution in the time domain with the inverse Fourier transform of \\( H(f) \\). This results in \\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\), where \\( h(t) \\) is the inverse Fourier transform of \\( H(f) \\).",
