  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\), specifically identifying the angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used, without knowing the original function?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is observed and exhibits a delta function at a specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), it directly implies that the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was a complex exponential of the form \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega_0 t} \\\\). The properties of the Fourier transform allow for this precise deduction from effect back to cause.",
