  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and this function is applied in a complex analysis setting. We explore the role of a contour integral transformation of this function over a closed path in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing that an intervention altered the contour path during integration and the resultant integral value is non-zero, can we deduce that the new path encloses at least one additional singularity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is entire and contains no singularities, a non-zero integral despite the function's nature suggests a calculation error or a misunderstanding of the contour's relation to singularity enclosures, as no singularities exist for this function.",
