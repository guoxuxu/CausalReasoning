  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p \\\\dot{x} + qx = 0 \\\\), where p and q are constants. We introduce a Fourier transform of the displacement function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed data after applying the damping term, can we determine whether the system originally had a critical damping (p^2 = 4q) without knowing \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a damped system does not straightforwardly reveal specific time-domain properties such as the critical damping condition because the added \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)-dependent exponential factor modifies the spectrum. Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and additional time-domain contextual data, the specific damping status of the original system cannot be distinguished.",
