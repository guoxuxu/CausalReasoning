  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + c\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the stability and transformation of the function under an integral transformation, defined as \\\\( T_h[f](z) = \\\\int_0^1 e^{ht} f(tz) dt \\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a real constant parameter.\n\nIf an additional transformation modified by a parameter \\\\(k\\\\) is applied after \\\\(T_h\\\\), defined as \\\\( S_k[f](z) = k \\\\cdot T_h[f](z) \\\\), will the outcome for some \\\\( z\\\\) depend only on the original function \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the parameters \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the transformations \\\\( T_h \\\\) and \\\\( S_k \\\\) actively alter the evaluated properties of the function, with dependencies extending beyond the original function \\\\( f \\\\). The multiplier \\\\( k \\\\) and the integral parameter \\\\(h\\\\) influence the resulting function, introducing a dependence on these transformation parameters.",
