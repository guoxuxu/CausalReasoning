  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) mapping real numbers to complex numbers. We explore the transformation driven by the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to this function resulting in \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), and analyze its impact under different conditions.\n\nIf a complex scaling \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}x(t)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) is calculated using \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), will \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) be the same as the Fourier transform of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The complex scaling introduces a frequency shift in the Fourier domain, due to the properties of the Fourier transform relative to exponential multiplication. This shift will not be observed if the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is transformed directly without scaling.",
