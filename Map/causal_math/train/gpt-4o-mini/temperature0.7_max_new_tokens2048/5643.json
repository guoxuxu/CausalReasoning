  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a controlled mechanical system whose state variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves under the influence of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) as described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Lx + K u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input represented by a function and \\\\( K \\\\) is a constant matrix dictating the influence of \\\\( u \\\\) on the state \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf an additional control force \\\\( g(t) = d(t)u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( d(t) \\\\) is a time-varying scalar function, is introduced as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the impact of the initial function \\\\( c \\\\) earlier mentioned cease to solely dictate the system’s behavior?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a time-varying control function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) means that the overall control effect is now the result of the interaction between \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\). The system’s evolution is jointly influenced by these parameters and not solely by \\\\( c \\\\) past the intervention point.",
