  "Problem": "Consider the operation of complex integration along a contour in the complex plane defined by \\\\\n\nIf a specific transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^n \\\\) (where \\\\( n \\\\) is a non-zero integer) is applied to the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) within the integral, and then a pole is introduced, does this solely affect the integral by the power \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformation modifies how \\\\( f(z) \\\\) behaves, introducing a pole still adds a residue to the integral that depends on the nature of the pole and its order, not just the transformation power \\\\( n \\\\). The effect on the integral involves both the transformation and the characteristics of the new pole.",
