  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and let the transformation be defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\theta t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being another real constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) = z(t) + e^{i \\beta t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\beta \\\\) is a real constant, and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is evaluated from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, is the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) dependent only on \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new frequency component to the system, which means the resulting integral after the intervention depends on both the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), the intervention's frequency \\\\( \\beta \\\\), and the parameter \\\\( \\theta \\\\). This makes the integral's result influenced by each of these factors.",
