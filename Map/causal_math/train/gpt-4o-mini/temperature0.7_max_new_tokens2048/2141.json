  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where initial data points are mapped in a complex plane according to the function \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( i \\\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant, and \\\\\\( t \\\\\\) is time. We examine the effect of another transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\\\) introduced as an intervention, where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) is not applied and the data points evolve solely under \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\) over time \\\\\\( t \\\\\\), will the magnitude of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\) only involves rotation of the vector \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) in the complex plane, maintaining its magnitude. The scalar magnitude is not affected by the rotational motion about the origin, thus remaining constant.",
