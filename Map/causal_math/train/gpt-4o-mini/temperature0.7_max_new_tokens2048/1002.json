  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a matrix-valued function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane and is examined over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\), it's impossible to determine if the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulted from an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Mz_0 \\\\). The potential alteration by \\\\( M \\\\) creates an ambiguity in tracing back to the true \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
