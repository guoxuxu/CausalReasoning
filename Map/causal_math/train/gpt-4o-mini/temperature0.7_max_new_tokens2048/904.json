  "Problem": "In a complex analysis scenario, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\), integrating over the variable s. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time t, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency parameter.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be determined if there has been an intervention changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), based solely on the observed outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not reveal whether it was achieved by a continuous path with a single \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or through changes in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Different frequency paths could result in the same outcome in the complex plane, and without additional information, it's impossible to deduce if an intervention occurred.",
