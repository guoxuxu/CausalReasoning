  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the wave equation in a one-dimensional domain, defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to the initial conditions.\n\nIf an intervention changes the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\) to a new value at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the original wave speed?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the wave speed alters the rate of propagation of each frequency component in the wave equation. The final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) depends on both the original and the new wave speeds, as these influence the cumulative phase and amplitude changes in the Fourier domain.",
