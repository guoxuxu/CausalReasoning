  "Problem": "Examine the steady-state behavior of a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real valued function satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) for a constant matrix A, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. Consider the Fourier transform applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and its interactions.\n\nObserving the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), can we unambiguously determine the value of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at any specific time without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform provides information about the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), but the phase information and the exact moment in time for specific values of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) are not directly retrievable due to the inherent properties of the Fourier transform.",
