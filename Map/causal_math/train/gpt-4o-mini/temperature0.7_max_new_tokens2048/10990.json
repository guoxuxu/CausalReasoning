  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) - By(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y}(t) = Bx(t) + Ay(t) \\\\), with A and B being constants. Let's examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nBy observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitively determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\), given that the initial phase and magnitude changes introduced by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) cannot be distinguished from the effects of the differential equations alone.",
