  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function over the complex plane given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_C g(s) e^{zs} ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is a complex-analytical function. We examine the effects of modifying the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( h(s) \\\\), thus making it \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point we introduce an additional modifying function \\\\( k(s) \\\\) applied specifically at a single value of \\\\( s_0 \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( F(z) \\\\) be solely dependent on the initial form of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( k(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the function \\\\( k(s) \\\\) affects the integrand at \\\\( s_0 \\\\) and modifies the integral computation. This intervention affects the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), hence making it dependent not only on \\\\( g(s) \\\\) but also on \\\\( k(s) \\\\).",
