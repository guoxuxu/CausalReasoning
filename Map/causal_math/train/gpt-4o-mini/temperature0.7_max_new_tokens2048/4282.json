  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. This system is influenced by applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, one cannot reliably trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation could have shifted the initial value, impacting the subsequent evolution under the non-linear differential equation.",
