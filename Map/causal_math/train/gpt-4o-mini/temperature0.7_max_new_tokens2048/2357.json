  "Problem": "Consider the environment described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(w) = Aw + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants, on the evolution of this function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T(w) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then we let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolve naturally without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the transformation was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(w) \\\\) initially modifies the starting value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( A z(0) + B \\\\). The subsequent evolution under the function \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) will reflect this modified initial condition, leading to a different result at time T due to the complex shift and scaling by A and B.",
