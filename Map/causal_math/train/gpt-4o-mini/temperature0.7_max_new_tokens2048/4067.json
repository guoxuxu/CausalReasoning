  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real frequency. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) adds another complex scaling factor which, together with \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), influences the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the trajectory and endpoint of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) does depend on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), along with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
