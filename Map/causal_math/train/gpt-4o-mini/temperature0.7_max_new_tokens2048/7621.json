  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by a linear differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. We investigate the effects of introducing a modified voltage source \\\\( V'(t) = V(t) + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf the modified voltage source \\\\( V'(t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the circuit is allowed to respond naturally without further intervention, will the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if the original source \\\\( V(t) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The modified voltage source adds an oscillatory component to the input, affecting the circuit's response. This change will alter the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\), resulting in a different current at any time T compared to the scenario without the sinusoidal component.",
