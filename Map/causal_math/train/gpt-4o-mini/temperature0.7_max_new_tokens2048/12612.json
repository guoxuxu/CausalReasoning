  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by the convolution integral \\\\( z(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input function, and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response of the system represented using the Laplace transform as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). We investigate the changes when applying a scaling transformation \\\\( f(x) = kx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant scalar.\n\nIf the scaling function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\), then left to evolve under the convolution integral without further intervention, will the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be proportionally scaled by \\\\( k \\\\) at any time t?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear, applying the scaling function \\\\( f(x) = kx(t) \\\\) results in the output scaling directly with \\\\( k \\\\). The convolution of a scaled input with the impulse response will output a scaled response, i.e., \\\\( z(t) = k(h * x)(t) \\\\).",
