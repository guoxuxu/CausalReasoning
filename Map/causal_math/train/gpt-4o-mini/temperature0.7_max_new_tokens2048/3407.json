  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nIf a second transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) depend solely on the initial phase shift \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) provided by \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\). The total phase shift observed in the Fourier transform will be a combination of both \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), influenced by the temporal ordering and specifics of how and when \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied. The resulting Fourier transform is dependent on both transformations.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function z(t) is composed of real functions u(t) and v(t), which together influence the Fourier transform Z(ω). The phase shift transformation h(z) affects the signal z(t) and consequently alters the Fourier transform Z(ω). Similarly, the second transformation g(z) also modifies z(t) and impacts Z(ω). Therefore, the final Fourier transform Z(ω) is influenced by both phase shifts from h(z) and g(z).",
