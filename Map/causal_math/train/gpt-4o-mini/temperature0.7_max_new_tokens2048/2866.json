  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. We explore the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) on these components separately and together.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = L[z(t)] \\\\), can we determine the functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) separately by using the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of a complex function can be split into its real and imaginary parts, we can use the inverse Laplace transform on both \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(Z(s)) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\text{Im}(Z(s)) \\\\) to retrieve \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), respectively.",
