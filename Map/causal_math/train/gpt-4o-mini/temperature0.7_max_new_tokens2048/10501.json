  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across an element is described by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = Ve^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( V \\\\) as a constant voltage amplitude and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the angular frequency. The response of the circuit (current, \\\\( I(t) \\\\)) is given by a convolution involving the circuit's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes changing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the voltage function \\\\( V(t) \\\\) directly change the resulting current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) if no other component in the circuit is altered?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the convolution of \\\\( V(t) = Ve^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), any change in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) alters the frequency components in \\\\( V(t) \\\\), which directly impacts the resulting current due to frequency-dependent behavior of the circuit's impedance.",
