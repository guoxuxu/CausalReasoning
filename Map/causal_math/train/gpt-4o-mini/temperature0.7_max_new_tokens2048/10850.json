  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) is a constant. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) versus simply evolving \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf we observe the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t, can we determine the initial configuration \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of the Fourier transform, backtracking to the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is hindered by the lack of information about the domain (frequency vs spatial) in which the function was evolved, particularly because the Fourier transform affects the representation of the function.",
