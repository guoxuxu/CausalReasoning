  "Problem": "Consider a time-varying complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We look at the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the observed \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) after an unknown convolutional intervention, can we precisely reconstruct the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)—\\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)—from just this transformed data?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the convolution with an unknown \\\\( h(t) \\\\) before computing \\\\( F(z) \\\\) obscures the direct inference of the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the transformed data alone. Multiple possible combinations of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result in the same transformed output, making the exact back-calculation of the original function infeasible without additional data.",
