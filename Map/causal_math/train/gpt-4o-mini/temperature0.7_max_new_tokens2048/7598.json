  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\phi & -\\sin \\phi \\\\ \\sin \\phi & \\cos \\phi \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) representing a rotation by an angle \\\\( \\phi \\\\) on the complex plane.\n\nKnowing the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we identify whether a rotation by \\\\( A \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since rotation preserves the nature of the trajectory on the complex plane, the rotated trajectory \\\\( Az(t) \\\\) still forms a circular path, indistinguishable from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, observing the nature of the trajectory at T does not reveal whether the initial state was rotated.",
