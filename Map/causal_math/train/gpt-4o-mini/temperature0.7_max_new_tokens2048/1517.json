  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and \\\\(u\\\\) is the control input. The analysis revolves around the effect of applying a linear feedback control \\\\(u = Kx\\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nAssuming the feedback control \\\\(u = Kx\\\\) is implemented at t = 0, and the system is left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + NKx\\\\) without further intervention, will the system state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at any time t be the same compared to a scenario where no control (\\\\(u = 0\\\\)) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the feedback control changes the dynamics from \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = (M + NK)x\\\\). The feedback matrix K directly influences the behavior of the system, altering the trajectories from what they would have been under uncontrolled conditions (\\\\(u = 0\\\\)).",
