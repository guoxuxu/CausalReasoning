  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit involving a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We analyze the response of this system to a complex input signal \\( x(t) \\) using the Laplace transform, where the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) is \\( X(s) \\) and that of \\( h(t) \\) is \\( H(s) \\).\n\nAssuming the system starts at rest, if the input \\( x(t) \\) is applied and evolves naturally, will the output \\( y(t) \\) at any arbitrary time \\( t \\) be equivalent to the convolution of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) without any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, in a linear time-invariant system, the output \\( y(t) \\) is always given by the convolution of the input \\( x(t) \\) with the system's impulse response \\( h(t) \\), which represents the system's inherent behavior to any input. Thus, \\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\) correctly provides the output for any given input without modifications.",
