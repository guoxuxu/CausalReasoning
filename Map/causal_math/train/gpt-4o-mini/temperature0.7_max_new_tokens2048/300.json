  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. The change of this function over time is given by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine what specific interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from various combinations of interventions due to the properties of exponential transformations in the complex plane. Different sequences of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) can lead to indistinguishable endpoints, thus not uniquely determining the interventions used.",
