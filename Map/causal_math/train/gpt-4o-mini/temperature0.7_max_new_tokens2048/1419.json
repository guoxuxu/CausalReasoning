  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of an integral transformation on a function's Fourier transform. Suppose we have a function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) and we apply the transformation \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\). Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) as applied on both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( T(g)(x) \\\\).\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( S(g)(x) = g(x) + x^2 \\\\) is applied at a point during the computation of \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the final state depend only on the transformation \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform reflects both the initial effect of \\\\( T \\\\) and the subsequent effect of \\\\( S \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) changes the integrand structure significantly which, when further modified by \\\\( S \\\\), results in a final state whose spectral properties are influenced by both transformations.",
