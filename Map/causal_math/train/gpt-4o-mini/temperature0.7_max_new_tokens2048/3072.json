  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We explore the impact of a boundary condition modification \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\), a given function, and how it affects the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) across the domain.\n\nCan we determine which conditions were applied (\\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) and/or \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y_1) = k(x) \\\\)) based solely on the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) observed in the domain?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) may not provide enough information to uniquely identify separate impacts of boundary conditions applied at different locations due to the potential overlap in their effects within the Laplace equation's solutions.",
