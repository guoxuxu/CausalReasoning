  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an additional signal shaping function \\\\( h(x) = e^{-bx^2} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) is applied during the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(x)f(x) \\\\), will the resultant spectrum be solely influenced by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and not by \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces another level of signal shaping, which influences the final spectrum alongside \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) together alter the signal’s spectrum by their combined filtering effects, resulting in a convolution of effects in the frequency domain.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The signal f(x) is modified by the Gaussian g(x) to produce g(x)f(x). The combination of g(x) and f(x) is further influenced by the shaping function h(x) to form h(x)g(x)f(x). The Fourier transform of f(x) is determined by f(x) itself, while the Fourier transform of g(x)f(x) is influenced by both g(x) and f(x). The spectrum is affected by g(x) and also by h(x) when applied to the combined signal.",
