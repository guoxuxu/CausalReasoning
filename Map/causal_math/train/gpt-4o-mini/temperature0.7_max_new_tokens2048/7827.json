  "Problem": "Analyze a heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, representing heat transfer in a one-dimensional rod. The function \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x)\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is a spatial heat source distribution that varies with position \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another function \\\\( j(u) = u - h(x) \\\\) (representing a cooling effect) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(k\\\\) and not on the initial modifications by \\\\(g(u)\\\\) or subsequent intervention by \\\\(j(u)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intermediate intervention with \\\\(j(u)\\\\) reverses the initial modification by subtracting \\\\(h(x)\\\\), yet the overall solution would still be consequent on how the heat evolved both before and after \\\\(t_1\\\\). The net result at \\\\(T\\\\) thus depends on the dynamics influenced by both interventions, as well as the inherent properties of the system characterized by \\\\(k\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The thermal diffusivity constant k influences the rate of change of temperature u_t, which in turn affects the spatial temperature distribution u_{xx}. The function g(u) modifies the temperature u by adding a spatial heat source h(x), and the function j(u) represents a cooling effect that also modifies u. Ultimately, the endpoint temperature u(x,T) is determined by the initial conditions and interventions applied to u.",
