  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) represented in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are complex constants. The impact of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) is considered, where R is also a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the effects introduced by \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\) can mask or alter the initial condition in ways that are not reversible purely based on the knowledge of P and Q and observations at time T.",
