  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nGiven the end state \\( u(x, T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( F(u) \\), \\( G(u) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( u(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used (i.e., \\( F(u) \\) or \\( G(u) \\) or both) based solely on observing the final state \\( u(x, T) \\) is challenging due to the potential overlapping effects of these transformations on the heat equation dynamics. These transformations can result in equivalent states through different paths, creating ambiguity in back-tracing the specific interventions applied.",
