  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nIf the transformed function after intervention is \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega - a} \\\\), can we determine the exact values of both the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\) from \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The expression \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega - a} \\\\) clearly specifies both the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the imaginary part of the composite term and \\\\( a \\\\) as the real part shift, uniquely identifying both parameters from the modified transformed function.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformed function Z'(s) is derived from the original function z(t), which indicates that changes in z(t) directly influence Z'(s). Additionally, the transformed function Z'(s) provides information that can be used to determine the original frequency ω and the intervention parameter a, suggesting that Z'(s) causally influences both ω and a. Furthermore, ω and a can also influence z(t), establishing a feedback relationship.",
