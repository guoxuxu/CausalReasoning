  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( z(t) \\) is a complex function and \\( s \\) is a complex parameter. Analyze the Laplace transform's effect on \\( z(t) \\) modified at \\( t = 0 \\) by \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) and impacted by \\( h(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\( f(z) \\) at a specific \\( s \\), can we infer whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) based on \\( z(t) \\)'s initial squared condition?",
  "Explanation": "The integration process in the Laplace Transform masks specific details about initial conditions due to its global nature over all \\( t \\). Without additional information, the resulting transform \\( f(z) \\) does not unambiguously indicate whether \\( g(z) \\) (squaring) was applied initially.",
