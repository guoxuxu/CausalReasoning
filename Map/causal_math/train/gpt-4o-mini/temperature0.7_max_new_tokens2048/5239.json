  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x + e^{iBt}y \\\\) where x and y are constant vectors and A, B are constant matrices. The function describes the evolution of a vector in a complex plane subjected to two rotational effects.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time t1 where \\\\( z \\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend solely on the original matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) introduces an additional rotational effect governed by matrix C. This new effect changes the subsequent trajectory and makes the state at time T dependent not only on A and B but also on C.",
