  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) applied to a time-dependent differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u = g(t) \\\\). We investigate the effect of an external transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(t) = te^{kt} \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nGiven \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine \\\\( g(t) \\\\) assumed to be \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without any additional information about k?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the constant k, we cannot reliably backtrack from \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T to determine \\\\( g(t) \\\\) because the form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) critically depends on k. Multiple values of k could generate different functions that result in the same observed output at t = T, thus preventing unique inference of k or \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
