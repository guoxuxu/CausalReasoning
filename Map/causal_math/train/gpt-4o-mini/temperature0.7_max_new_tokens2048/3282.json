  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where a function \\( z(t) = e^{it}u \\) for complex \\( u \\) is undergoing transformation with \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\), where C is a complex number. The impact of an operation defined as \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) wherein D is a distinct complex constant is considered.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\( u \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) might have been applied at time t = 0, reversing the evolution to find \\( u \\) relies on this knowledge. Without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied, the complex exponential growth due to D can't be disentangled from the dynamics solely due to C, making it impossible to uniquely deduce \\( u \\).",
