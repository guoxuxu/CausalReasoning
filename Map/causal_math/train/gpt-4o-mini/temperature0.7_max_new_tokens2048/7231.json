  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{(i \\\\omega + a)t} \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, does the Laplace transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) still depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{(i \\\\omega + a)t} \\\\), and its Laplace transform becomes \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega - a} \\\\). This transformed function now depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\), indicating a dependency beyond just \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
