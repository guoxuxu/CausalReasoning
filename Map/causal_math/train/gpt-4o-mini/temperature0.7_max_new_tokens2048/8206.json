  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) defined on a complex domain, and a transformation h(z) where \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\). We analyze the effect of applying this transformation to various complex numbers and observing the results over the domain.\n\nGiven the result f(z) for some z, can we determine whether h(z) was applied to find the original input to f(z) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether h(z) was applied, it is difficult to deduce the original z from f(z) alone because squaring a complex number (as done by h(z)) does not have a unique inverse - there could be multiple candidates for z that, when squared, give the same output.",
