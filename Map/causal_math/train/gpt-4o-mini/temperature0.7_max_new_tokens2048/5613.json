  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where t represents time. Consider further the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), defined for complex s where Re(s) > 0.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed without any modifications into \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), does this transformation preserve the periodicity of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation transforms the periodic function into a function of complex frequency s, capturing exponential decay rather than periodicity. The complex exponential's oscillations are averaged out over time, resulting in non-periodic behavior in the Laplace domain.",
