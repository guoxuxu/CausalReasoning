  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(\\ z = h(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\)\\), where x and y are variables modified by a transformation \\(\\ T(u, v) = (e^{Au}v, e^{Bu}v) \\)\\) dependent on parameters A and B.\n\nGiven \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) at \\(\\ t = T \\)\\) after transformation, can we deduce the original variables (u, v) at \\(\\ t = 0 \\)\\) without knowing whether transformation \\(\\ T \\)\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\(\\ T \\)\\) was applied, it is not feasible to accurately trace back to (u, v) from \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\). The function \\(\\ h \\)\\) involves non-linear operations and the transformation \\(\\ T \\)\\) incorporates exponentials, making it complex to disentangle (u, v) uniquely from the observed \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\).",
