  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant coefficients. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system over time t, where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (with D as another complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), would the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by A and B, regardless of C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another complex exponential factor, diversifying the final state's dependence to include C and D as well. The combined influence of the exponential transformations brought by C and D, with their own growth and rotation characteristics, strongly affects the trajectory and final outcome.",
