  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system where the temperature distribution over a rod is given by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the diffusion constant. An integral transformation is applied, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\), to solve for the temperature distribution.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowledge of whether the Fourier transform was utilized?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation is deterministic and reversible when appropriate boundary conditions are known. This implies that for any distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), one can trace back to find the initial distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) uniquely, irrespective of the use of the Fourier transform. The use of the Fourier transform for solving does not alter this reversibility.",
