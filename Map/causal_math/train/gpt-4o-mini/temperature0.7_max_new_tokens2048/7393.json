  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) representing a wave at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\). Analyze the influence of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant, before applying the Laplace Transform.\n\nIf we apply the decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then perform the Laplace Transform without any other manipulation, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) become \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i \\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When applying the decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) directly to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it modifies the input of the Laplace Transform. The resulting transformed function now includes the decay rate \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) in its s-domain representation, correctly adjusting the original pole from \\\\( s = i \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( s = \\alpha + i \\omega \\\\), thus yielding \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i \\omega} \\\\).",
