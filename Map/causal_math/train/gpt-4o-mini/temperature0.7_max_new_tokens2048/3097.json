  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We assess the impact of the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) over time t, where \\( \\alpha \\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to an initial complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) \\) modifies the initial condition by scaling it with \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\). This changes the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) by adding the effect of \\( \\alpha \\), which introduces additional exponential growth or decay dependent on the real part of \\( \\alpha \\), and a rotational component depending on its imaginary part, thus affecting the final state at \\( T \\).",
