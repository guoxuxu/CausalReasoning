  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We introduce a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. This scenario examines the impact of this transformation on the system's behavior over time.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial function form or parameters \\\\( z(0) \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowledge that \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), recovering the original parameters such as \\\\( z(0) \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is not feasible as the integration and matrix transformation introduce non-reversible changes to the function's state up to time T.",
