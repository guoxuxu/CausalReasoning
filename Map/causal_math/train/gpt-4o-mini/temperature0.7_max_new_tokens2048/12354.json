  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex system modeled by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. The transformation considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf a new complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the system's intrinsic properties (here \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)) and not be influenced by the transformations \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional factor influencing the system's behavior, which changes the state independently from the intrinsic rotation caused by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), as all contribute to magnitude and phase transformations over time.",
