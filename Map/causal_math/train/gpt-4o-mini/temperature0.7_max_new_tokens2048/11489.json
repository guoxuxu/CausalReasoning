  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant. Analyses concern how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant, affect the function's behavior over iterations.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane and then iterated under \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at iteration t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly iterated under \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by a rotation in the complex plane. This pre-transformation alters the orbit of the initial point when iterating under \\\\( f(z) \\\\), since the quadratic transformation in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could magnify the rotational displacement brought by \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
