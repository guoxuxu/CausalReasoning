  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation represented by the operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iws} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in the form of a differential operator \\\\( D[f](t) = \\\\frac{d}{dt}f(t) \\\\), will the resulting function at time \\\\( T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) still be represented as a simple transformation (by either \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)) of \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The combined effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) as an intervention alters the course of the function beyond simple transformations of \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\). The differential operation introduces an additional dynamic dependent on the derivative, not just the original exponential function.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) is transformed by the operator T to produce T[f](t), which is then differentiated by the operator D to yield the result at time T. The constant w influences the behavior of z(t), while the variable t is also a factor in determining z(t). An intervention at time t_1 through the operator D is associated with changes in T, particularly for times greater than t_1.",
