  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the equation \\\\( U(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) where k is a positive constant. The particle's motion is transformed by a change of coordinates given by \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the transformation by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) values, each providing a different scaling effect that could yield the same final position. The non-invertibility of the exponential scaling in time prevents us from uniquely identifying the parameters of interventions from the final state alone.",
