  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving through a vector field described by the velocity function \\\\( v(x, t) = Ax + h(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and h(t) is a time-dependent vector function. We explore the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{As}x ds \\\\) on the particle's trajectory.\n\nGiven the output trajectory \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if we know that \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) was applied at the beginning, without assuming any other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) on the initial position integrates factors that depend on the matrix exponential, which are generally difficult to decompose uniquely without additional data about the system's parameters like A and h(t).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The constant matrix A and the time-dependent vector function h(t) together determine the velocity v(x, t) of the particle. The initial position x_0 influences the final trajectory x(T) of the particle after the integral transformation T_t is applied. The trajectory x(T) is also influenced by the velocity v(x, t). Therefore, knowing the output trajectory x(T) and the transformations applied allows us to trace back to the initial position x_0.",
