  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is another real constant, applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nBased on the final complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used, just by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of scaling factors \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), along with different values of \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can result in the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The final outcome does not uniquely specify which interventions were used, as various combinations could lead to indistinguishable results in magnitude and phase at time T.",
