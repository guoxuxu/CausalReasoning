Explore the impacts of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\(T(z) = Cz(t)\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nGiven the system output z(T) at time T, can the initial output z(0) be uniquely determined without knowing whether the transformation T(z) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of T(z), multiple possible initial states could lead to the same observed output at T due to the properties of integration and the system's sensitivity to initial conditions.",
