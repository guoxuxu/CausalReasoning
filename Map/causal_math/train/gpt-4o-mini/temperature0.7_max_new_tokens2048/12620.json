  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a square matrix. We explore the system's response under the integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where N is another constant matrix and t is a parameter for duration.\n\nApplying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then observing the system over time under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T be the same as if no transformation were applied and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was simply evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial trajectory of the system. The integral factor \\\\( e^{Ns} \\\\) adds layers to the output which integrates past states influenced by matrix N. As such, the resulting state at time T is a cumulative function of past influences and cannot be the same as simple evolution under M.",
