  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature of an object (T) varies in time and can be modeled by the function \\\\( T(x, t) = u(x) + v(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is the initial temperature profile and \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) represents the effect of external forces changing the temperature over time t. Suppose the effect of an external force is described by the integral transform \\\\( v(x,t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and f(t) varies non-linearly with time.\n\nIf at time t=0 the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is started without further modifications, will the temperature \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) for T=10 only depend on the initial profile \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and not on the external forces?",
  "Explanation": "The external forces described by \\\\( f(t) \\\\) contribute non-linearly through the integral transform, affecting the temperature evolution over time. Thus, \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) at T=10 will depend not only on the initial profile \\\\( u(x) \\\\) but also on the cumulative effects of f as modified by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{A(t-s)} \\\\).",
