  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis problem where the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is transformed using an integral along a contour \\\\( C \\\\). The contour \\\\( C \\\\) is specified to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Assume that the variable transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to modify the path of integration.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the contour \\\\( C \\\\) at the beginning and the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is then integrated over the transformed contour without further intervention, will the value of the integral be the same as the original integral over \\\\( C \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the path of integration and possibly the orientation or number of times the contour encircles points of interest (e.g., poles of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)). In this specific case, the transformation will change how many times the contour encircles the origin, potentially altering residues and the value of the integral according to the residue theorem.",
