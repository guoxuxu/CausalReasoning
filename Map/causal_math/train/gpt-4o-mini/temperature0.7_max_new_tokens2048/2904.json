  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also define a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant and t represents time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The potential for multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) affecting the trajectory in ways that could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) means that the final state alone doesn't provide enough information to uniquely determine which transformations were applied, their parameters, or their sequence.",
