  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the scenario where the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is applied, with N also being a complex matrix.\n\nCan we precisely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if and how \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, determining the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous. The transformation \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) could have changed the starting point in a non-trivial way correlated with the dynamics governed by M, and reversing that effect without precise knowledge of N's impact is not feasible.",
