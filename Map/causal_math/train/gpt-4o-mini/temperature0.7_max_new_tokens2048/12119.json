  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) on this function.\n\nGiven the result of the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after an unknown intervention, can we precisely determine if a change in frequency was applied as an intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the Fourier transform may show multiple frequency components, but it is impossible to uniquely determine the sequence or specific nature of interventions such as a precise shift in frequency, because different interventions could produce similar spectral characteristics.",
