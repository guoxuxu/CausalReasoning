  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\), where L is a differential operator. Consider how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system's behavior.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\) of the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is taken, and then the system is evolved according to \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T before transforming?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and then evolving the system only alters the domain in which the solution is calculated. The linearity and time-invariant properties of both the operator L and the Fourier transform ensure that \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\) corresponds directly to the Fourier transform of the solution had it been evolved in the spatial domain.",
