  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. To analyze causal effect and intervention, we study the system's behavior under a transformation defined by \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where M is a linear operator.\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, if we do not know whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T does not allow us to accurately trace back to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) unless we know whether the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) was applied. The transformation could have modified the initial state in a complex way, especially if the operators M and L interact in a non-trivial manner.",
