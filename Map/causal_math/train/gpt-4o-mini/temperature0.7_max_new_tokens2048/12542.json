  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) in a function space. We apply a Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(k) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x)) \\\\) in the frequency domain. The change in the system over time t is analyzed by applying the operator to \\\\( U(k) \\\\) exponentiated by a complex function, specifically \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)U(k) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega = ck \\\\) and c is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\), using a different operator \\\\( M \\\\), which also modifies \\\\( U(k) \\\\) in the frequency domain (e.g., \\\\( M\\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)U(k)) \\\\), will the state of the system at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the initial transformation or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( M \\\\) introduces a new influence that alters the final state in conjunction with \\\\( L \\\\) and the initial transformation. The cumulative effects of \\\\( L \\\\), the initial Fourier Transform, and \\\\( M \\\\) together determine the system's state at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
