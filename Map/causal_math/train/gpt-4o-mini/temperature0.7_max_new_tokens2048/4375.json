  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex plane, described by the relation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Consider the effect spatially shifting this function using another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + Ce^{Bt} \\\\), where B and C are constant complex numbers.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( q(z) = z - De^{Et} \\\\) (where D and E are constants) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 remain solely dependent on A and not on B, C, D, or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics, affecting both the trajectory and endpoint. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interplay of A, B, C, D, and E due to the combined effects of these transformations and their timing.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex value z_0 leads to the function z(t), which is influenced by the constant complex number A. The function z(t) can be transformed through h(z) and q(z), which add shifts based on constants B, C, D, and E. However, the endpoint z(T) is directly determined by z(t) and the transformations, suggesting that A remains a primary influence, but B, C, D, and E also have a role in the final outcome.",
