  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a nonlinear system characterized by the function \\\\( z = f(x,y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\\\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variables. We consider the application of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to variable \\( z \\).\n\nIf \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values are altered to \\( x'=ax \\) and \\( y'=by \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants, and then \\( z \\) is calculated without further modification, does this change the outcome of \\( g(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied after modifying \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the new \\( z' \\) will be \\( (ax)^2 + 3(ax)(by) + (by)^2 \\). The exponential nature of \\( g(z) \\) means small changes in \\( z \\) due to changes in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can lead to significantly different outcomes in \\( g(z) \\).",
