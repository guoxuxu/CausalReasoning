  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the system of differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = -v + cu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = u + cv \\\\), where c is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an initial transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's unclear whether the observed trajectory began from a rotated initial condition. The impact of \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) on the initial state could fundamentally alter the solution path, making it impossible to reliably trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without this knowledge.",
