  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation in one dimension described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and this modified state is then evolved by the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if the original \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved directly under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(u) \\\\) alters the initial temperature distribution by multiplying it by \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), which changes dynamically with time. This initial modification changes the evolution of the system under the heat equation, resulting in a different temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
