  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network consisting of resistors and capacitors governed by the equation \\\\(V(t) = U(C, R, t)\\\\) where V is the voltage, U is a function of capacitor values (C), resistance values (R) and time (t). Let a transformation be defined by \\\\(f(V) = Z^{-1}e^{At}V\\\\), where Z is the impedance matrix and A is a diagonal matrix representing frequency-dependent behavior.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system’s impedance Z to a new value \\\\(Z'\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final voltage \\\\(V(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the new impedance and not by the initial transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(V(T)\\\\), while influenced significantly by the updated impedance matrix \\\\(Z'\\\\), is also dependent on how the initial state was transformed by \\\\(f(V)\\\\). Both the initial condition modified by A and the changes due to \\\\(Z'\\\\) will affect the system’s voltage at time T.",
