  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We look at how the Laplace transform affects this function over the variable t, focusing on the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nCan we perfectly reconstruct the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform can uniquely recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\). Since the transformation is invertible for this specific function, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) can be perfectly reconstructed.",
