  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( G(k) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the solution \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) at time T > t_1 be independent of the initial function \\\\( U(x, 0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G(k) \\\\) modifies the intermediate state, adding an exponential damping based on \\\\( k \\\\), hence the ultimate solution \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) still depends on the modified state, which in turn was dependent on the initial function. Therefore, \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) reflects both the initial conditions and the effect of the intervention.",
