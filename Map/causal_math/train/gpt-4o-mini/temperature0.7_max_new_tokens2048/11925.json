  "Problem": "Assume a differential equation governing the temperature \\\\( T \\\\) of a body over time is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant and \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature. Now consider a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + h \\\\) applied at some initial time, where \\\\( h \\\\) represents a heating intervention.\n\nHaving the knowledge of the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t \\\\), is it possible to definitively conclude whether the transformation \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without further data?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( T(t) \\\\) does not disclose whether the initial temperature was originally \\\\( T(0) \\\\) or \\\\( T(0) + h \\\\). The information about whether an intervention occurred is lost as the exponential decay smoothens out initial differences over time.",
