  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = C \\\\int_0^t \\\\exp(A(s-t))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A, B, and C are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) where D is a transformation matrix.\n\nWith known \\\\( w(T) \\\\) and transformations \\\\( D \\\\) applied, can we uniquely determine the control inputs (\\\\( u(t) \\\\) or \\\\( v(t) \\\\)) used at any point prior to \\\\( T \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact control inputs \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or \\\\( v(t) \\\\) from \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is not feasible without extra data like exact time of intervention or system parameters (A, B, C), since the outputs could result from various combinations of control actions and system dynamics, and the matrix D could obscure the effects of these controls.",
