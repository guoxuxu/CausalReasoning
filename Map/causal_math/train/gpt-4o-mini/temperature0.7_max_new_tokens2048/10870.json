  "Problem": "Consider a vibrating mechanical system that can be mathematically modeled as a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping ratio and natural frequency respectively. Suppose an external impulse given by the function \\\\(f(t) = \\\\delta(t - t_0)\\\\) (Dirac delta function) applies at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nBy observing the frequency of oscillations of the mechanical system, can we uniquely determine if the external impulse was applied at \\\\(t_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) remains unchanged irrespective of whether the impulse was applied or not. The impulse affects the amplitude and phase but not the natural frequency of the oscillating system.",
