  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(k(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T strictly depend on the matrix A and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(k(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) introduces a counteracting phase shift, making the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) dependent not only on the matrix A but also on the original transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and the intervention. The interaction of these complex exponentials affects the trajectory and final state of the system.",
