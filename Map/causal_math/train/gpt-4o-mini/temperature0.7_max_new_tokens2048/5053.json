  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping described by \\\\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\\\) in the complex plane, and assess the impact of an integral transformation on this function given as \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int e^{-st} w(t) \\\\, dt \\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\) defines an initial state of the system and evolves through time without any external integral transformations, does the output state at time \\\\(T\\\\) solely depend on the original mapping \\\\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no transformation alters the function, the system's state at any time \\\\(T\\\\) will only reflect the inherent changes dictated by the structure of the function \\\\(w(z)\\\\), which describes its complete time evolution when unmodified.",
