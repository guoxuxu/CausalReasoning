  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) representing a heat distribution over a rod along the spatial variable x and time t, governed by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effects of applying a source term \\( S(x,t) \\), which varies along x and t.\n\nIf the source term \\( S(x,t) = e^{-t} \\cos x \\) is added from the initial time \\( t = 0 \\), without any further manipulation, will the resulting temperature distribution \\( u(x,t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) solely depend on the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the source term \\( S(x,t) \\) adds heat to the system in a time-dependent manner, altering the temperature distribution from what would be predicted by the pure diffusion equation. The solution \\( u(x,t) \\) thus incorporates effects from both the initial condition and the time-varying source term.",
