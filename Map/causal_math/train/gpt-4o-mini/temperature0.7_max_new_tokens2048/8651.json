  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). This system deals with an input signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over time t, where the output signal \\\\( F(s) \\\\) represents the system's response in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an impulse function \\\\( g(t) = \\delta(t - t_1) \\\\) is added at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention in the system, will this change the result of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from what would have been obtained without the intervention, considering \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding an impulse function will indeed modify \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The Laplace Transform of \\\\( \\delta(t - t_1) \\\\) is \\\\( e^{-st_1} \\\\), which will additively alter the original transform, showing a dependency on the intervention and altering the expected output from solely being \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).",
