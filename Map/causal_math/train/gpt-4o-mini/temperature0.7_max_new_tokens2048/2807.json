  "Problem": "Consider the evolution of a complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) under transformation by integration against a kernel function \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\), where \\\\( z, s \\\\) are complex variables. The transformation is described by \\\\( w'(z) = \\\\int_D K(z, s) w(s) ds \\\\). Assume that \\\\( K \\\\) modifies how the function behaves in the domain differently based on its parameters.\n\nSuppose at a certain point, an additional kernel transformation \\\\( K_2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention. Will the subsequent state of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) for any \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\) depend only on the original kernel \\\\( K \\\\), ignoring effects of the new kernel \\\\( K_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new kernel transformation \\\\( K_2 \\\\) acts as an intervention that modifies the development trajectory and state of \\\\( w \\\\) within the domain. The final state of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) will be influenced by the effects of both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\), thus not solely dependent on the original kernel.",
