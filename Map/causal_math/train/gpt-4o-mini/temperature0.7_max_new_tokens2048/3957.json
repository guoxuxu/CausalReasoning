  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the outcome when the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is used, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = T under the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z_0 \\\\). The evolutionary path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is changed due to this modification, leading to a trajectory based on the altered initial condition, with exponential dependence on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) in addition to the oscillatory behavior due to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
