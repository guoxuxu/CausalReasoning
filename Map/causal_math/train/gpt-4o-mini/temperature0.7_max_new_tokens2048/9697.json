  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform on a function representing vector components \\\\( v(t) \\), where \\\\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then left to evolve as per \\\\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the frequency components of \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > 0 be the same as the initial frequency components of \\\\( v_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the Fourier transform alters the representation of \\\\( v_0 \\\\) by decomposing it into its frequency components. The subsequent evolution according to \\\\( e^{At}v_0 \\\\) then modifies these components differently depending on A, which results in a different spectrum at time T.",
