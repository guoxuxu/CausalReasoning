  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z \\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied.\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we unequivocally determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, and if so, deduce the properties of C?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different configurations of the matrices A, B, and C. Without additional information about the trajectory or the specific effects of the matrix C, it's impossible to conclusively back out whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied and what characteristics C held.",
