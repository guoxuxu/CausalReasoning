  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number frequency parameter. This function represents a complex exponential oscillation. Analyze the transformation with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nBased on the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\), can we precisely infer the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform produces a signature that is characteristic and unique to the frequency of the original function. Specifically, it forms a Dirac delta at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), allowing us to exactly deduce \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the transformed state.",
