  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = cos(x) + i sin(x) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let us examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( z(x) t= e^tx \\\\) on this complex function over a time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the value of \\\\( t \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( z(x, t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the exponential function and its effect on the rotation of the complex function, the exact value of \\\\( t \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) cannot be deduced only from the observations at \\\\( t = T \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^tx \\\\) affects the function's argument, leading to different rotations depending on the initial value of \\\\( t \\\\).",
