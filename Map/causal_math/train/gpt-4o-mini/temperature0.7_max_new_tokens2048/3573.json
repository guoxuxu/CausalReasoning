  "Problem": "Investigate the equation \\\\( dz = z \\\\cdot dt + x \\\\cdot dW \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a function of time driven by a deterministic component and a stochastic component influenced by \\\\( x \\\\), and \\\\( W \\\\) represents Brownian motion. Consider the impact of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( x \\\\) at different intervals.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( x \\\\) and is then allowed to evolve without further intervention according to the given differential equation, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x \\\\) was directly used without applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) changes the stochastic driving force, modifying the diffusion term from \\\\( x \\\\cdot dW \\\\) to \\\\( x^2 \\\\cdot dW \\\\). This fundamentally changes the dynamics and growth pattern of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory and value at time T.",
