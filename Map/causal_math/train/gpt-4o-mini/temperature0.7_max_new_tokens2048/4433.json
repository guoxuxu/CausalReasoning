  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Evaluate the change in the function through an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a different complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is used to transform \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without any alteration in parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), does the transformed function \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) reflect the same transformation as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly calculated at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the representation of the function, introducing an entirely different dependence on \\\\( t \\\\) across the entire interval from 0 to T, unlike the direct computation of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) at a specific point T.",
