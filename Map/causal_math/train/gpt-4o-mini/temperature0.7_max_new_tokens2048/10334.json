  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We're studying the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) over the interval [0,T] after observing the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the specific functional form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during that interval?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) provides a time-integrated, compound effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the interval which loses specific time-dependent information about \\\\( z(s) \\\\) on [0, T]. Deriving exact \\\\( z(s) \\\\) solely from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T isn't feasible without additional information about the function's form.",
