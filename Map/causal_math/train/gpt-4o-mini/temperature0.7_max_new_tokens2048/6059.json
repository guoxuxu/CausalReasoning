  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time evolving according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) as real constants. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-st}z(\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where the parameters \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are adjusted to new constants \\\\( k' \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the new parameters and not on the original \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influences the integral's value post-intervention. Both the original and the new parameters \\\\( k, \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k', \\\\omega' \\\\) will influence the system's trajectory, hence affecting \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\). The function's history pre-intervention retains an impact due to the cumulative nature of the integral.",
