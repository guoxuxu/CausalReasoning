  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a vibrating string given by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the speed of the wave in the string and \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). An external forcing term \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is added to the system, resulting in a modified equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + F(x,t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the displacement \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at some later time T, can we conclusively determine the previous application sequence and form of force \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\), with the assumption that there was no other type of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple forcing functions could theoretically result in the same observed displacement at time T, due to the properties of the linear partial differential equation. Therefore, without more specific data (like full-time series data), we cannot uniquely determine the applied force history merely from a single time point observation.",
