  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The scenario investigates how the function's behavior changes under various transformations, particularly a transformation applied by an integral operator \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(Tf(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\alpha s} f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a fixed real constant.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\(Tz(t)\\\\) at a specified time \\\\(t\\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) or the integral transformation parameters without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation process incorporates the integral which convolutes the effects of the original function and transformation parameters, making it challenging to disentangle and uniquely identify the initial function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) or the exact value of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) from the result \\\\(Tz(t)\\\\) alone.",
