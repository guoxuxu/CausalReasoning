  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform and its implications on signal processing.\n\nCan we precisely reconstruct the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its frequency domain representation given by the Fourier transform, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform allows for the exact reconstruction of the time domain signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its frequency domain representation. Given the precise and invertible nature of the Fourier transform for functions like \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\), this process accurately restores the original signal.",
