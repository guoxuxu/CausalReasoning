  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing a signal at time t. Assume that a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformed function is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](\\\\omega) \\\\), which offers a frequency domain representation of the signal.\n\nCan we perfectly recover the exact time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), without knowing if any modifications or noise were added post-Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Though a direct inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) ideally gives back \\\\( z(t) \\\\), any modifications in the transformed domain (like filtering or noise addition) which aren't accounted for can lead to inaccuracies in the recovered \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thereby preventing precise recovery of the original function.",
