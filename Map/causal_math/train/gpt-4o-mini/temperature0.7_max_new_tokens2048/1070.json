  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position components in a temporal dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with A and B being complex numbers.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without any knowledge of B?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing B, the back-calculation of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is ambiguous because B could have various values affecting the trajectory significantly. The differential equation includes B, making it essential for precisely retracing the initial condition.",
