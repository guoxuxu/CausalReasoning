  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function transformation on a real function g(x) over the domain [0, 1]. The transformation is defined by T(g)(x) = ∫_0^1 e^(iπsx) g(s) ds, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at some point in the interval, say x = 0.3, an additional transformation U defined by U(g)(x) = ∫_0^1 e^(i2πtx) g(t) dt is applied, will the resultant function at x = 1 depend only on the initial form of g and not on the applied transformations T and U?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations T and U apply complex functions to interact differently with g over the interval. The final value at x = 1 is influenced by how these transformations interplay, especially given their dependence on different frequencies in their exponential terms.",
