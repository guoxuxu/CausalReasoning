  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the function value \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equal to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) at t=0 changes the initial conditions. Although both A and B are complex scalars, they introduce phase rotations which accumulate differently over time, leading to a different complex function value at t = T.",
