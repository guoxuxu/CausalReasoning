  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical system where the rotation of a vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\) is defined by a complex function \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant representing angular velocity. The impact of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\), defined as scaling by a factor \\\\(s>0\\\\), is used as an intervention.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), the scaling linear transformation \\\\(L(v) = sv\\\\) is applied as an intervention and the vector continues to rotate, will the final state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the rotational transformation and not on the scaling factor \\\\(s\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the scaling transformation \\\\(L(v) = sv\\\\) alters the magnitude of the vector, which affects its subsequent rotation trajectory. Therefore, the final state at time \\\\(T\\\\) is dependent on both the initial rotation parameter \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and the scaling factor \\\\(s\\\\), influencing the position and size of the vector at \\\\(T\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The vector v is transformed by the function f(t, v), which causes it to rotate. The time t influences the rotation of v. The constant θ determines the rate of rotation of v. When the linear transformation L is applied to v, it produces a scaled vector. This scaled vector is then transformed by f(t, scaled vector), resulting in the rotation of the scaled vector. The scaling factor s affects the magnitude of the scaled vector but does not influence the rotation of the vector after the transformation.",
