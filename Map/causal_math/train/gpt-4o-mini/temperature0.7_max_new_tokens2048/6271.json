  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and let's analyze its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( I[z](t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\phi} \\\\) where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is a constant phase, is applied post the initial transformation at any time before ending, will the resulting integral \\\\( I[g \\cdot z](t) \\\\) be non-zero?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift changes the alignment of the complex exponential's real and imaginary parts, thus altering the outcome of the integral transformation. This results in a non-zero integral since the phase factor \\\\( e^{i\\phi} \\\\) does not cancel out during integration over a non-symmetric interval relative to the phase altered exponential.",
