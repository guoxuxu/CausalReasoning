  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by applying a complex Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-i\\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\). Analyze the impact of a linear differential operator \\\\( L = \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and how it affects the transformed function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed function \\\\( F_L(\\\\omega) \\\\) which is a result from applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without knowing the operation performed?",
  "Explanation": "If only \\\\( F_L(\\\\omega) \\\\) is known without the context of operations applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), the precise original form of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) cannot be reliably reconstructed. The Fourier transformation related to the differential operation masks the initial \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by a factor depending on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), complicating direct back-transformation.",
