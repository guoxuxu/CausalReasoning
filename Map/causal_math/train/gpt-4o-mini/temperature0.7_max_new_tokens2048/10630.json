  "Problem": "We are investigating the temperature dynamics in a material described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Consider the effect of a thermal control method described by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the scaling imposed by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\), the original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) could be misconceived due to the altered exponential factor. Any initial condition scaled differently by the exponential factor can lead to the observed state at t = T, hence making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( u_0 \\\\).",
