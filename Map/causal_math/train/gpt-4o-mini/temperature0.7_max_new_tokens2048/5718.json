  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We introduce a transformation using the integral operator \\\\( I[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}f(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately back-trace to the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( I \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certain knowledge of the application of \\\\( I \\\\), the effect of the initial transformation involving the integration and exponential based on matrix C is unknown. This makes it impossible to conclusively revert or decode back to the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), as the integration might have crucially altered the trajectory.",
