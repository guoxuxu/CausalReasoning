  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where a system is transformed by the matrix function \\\\( f(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is an invertible matrix. The system's behavior and outcomes are then studied under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is another matrix, to observe the evolution of the system over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(x) = Mx \\\\) was applied, it's challenging to trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely. The transformation by \\\\( M \\\\) could significantly alter \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in ways that are not reversible just by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) evolved under \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\\\).",
