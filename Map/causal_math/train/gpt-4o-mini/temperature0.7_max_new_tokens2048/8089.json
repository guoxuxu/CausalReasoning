  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential, \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 \\\\psi + V(x) \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is the potential energy function. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\\\hbar} \\\\), where H is a Hamiltonian operator.\n\nIf \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is applied to a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to Schrödinger's equation, will the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under Schrödinger’s equation without applying \\\\( U(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\) modifies the initial state, changing the evolution trajectory of the wave function. Even though \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is unitary and preserves norms and orthogonality, it alters the phase and spatial properties of the wave function, leading to a different state at time T.",
