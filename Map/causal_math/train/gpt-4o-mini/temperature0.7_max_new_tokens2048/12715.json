  "Problem": "Examine the steady-state behavior of a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real valued function satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) for a constant matrix A, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. Consider the Fourier transform applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and its interactions.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the modified \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we definitively determine if the intervention was a phase shift \\\\( e^{i\\\\delta t} \\\\), only relying on the Fourier spectrum observed for t > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions like amplitude modulation or additional phase shifts could produce similar effects in the Fourier spectrum. Without more information about the nature of the system and the type of intervention, it's challenging to uniquely identify the phase shift \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) solely from the transformed Fourier spectrum.",
