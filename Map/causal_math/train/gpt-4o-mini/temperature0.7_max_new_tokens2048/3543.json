  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\). We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) over time t, where k is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{mt}z \\\\) (where m is a different real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the governing differential equation and not on k or m?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor in the system's evolution, impacting the trajectory and magnifying the effects of the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Both the initial transformation and the intervention affect the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
