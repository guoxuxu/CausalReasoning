  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nIf at time t = t_1 a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\) (where c is a real constant different from k) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend strictly on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the interplay of \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since transformations by \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) scale the magnitude and may alter the phase of \\\\( z \\\\), the resulting state's magnitude and angle depend on all these factors. The compounded effects mean the transformation history influences the trajectory.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The rate of change of z at time t, denoted as dz/dt, directly influences the state of z. The state of z is influenced by the transformation g(z) at time t, and also by the transformation h(z) applied at a later time t_1. The transformation g(z) depends on the constant k, while h(z) depends on the constant c. However, the eventual state z(T) for T > t_1 is determined by the initial rate of change influenced by the constant ω.",
