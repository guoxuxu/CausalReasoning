  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) passed through an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described by the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-(t-s)^2} \\\\), such that the transformed function is \\\\( Tz(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(t, s) z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nIs it possible to accurately identify the specific sequence and nature of interventions (original frequency or shifted frequency) from the transformed output function \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integral transformation's smoothing effect and the overlap of effects from different frequencies induced by potential interventions, it is challenging to uniquely reverse-engineer and determine whether original or shifted frequencies, or both, were present in the input function merely by examining \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\).",
