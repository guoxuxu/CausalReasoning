  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\(z = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator, representing the transformation matrix. We explore the effects of applying a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(z(T)\\\\) after applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\), can we unambiguously deduce \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) incorporates complex factors (including changes in magnitude and phase) dependent on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to the output \\\\(z(T)\\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse engineer the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
