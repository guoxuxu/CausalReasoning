  "Problem": "Investigate a control system where the growth rate of a population \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\), with r being a growth constant. An intervention is performed using a function \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), where k is another constant, to modify the instantaneous growth rate at a specific time point.\n\nGiven the population at time t = T as \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine the initial population \\\\( y_0 \\\\) without knowing if any interventions were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of intervention, one cannot conclusively deduce \\\\( y_0 \\\\) since the exponential growth could be altered by intervening factors like \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), which change the trajectory different from the natural exponential growth.",
