  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are complex numbers. We analyze the behavior of this function under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = g(z) + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) be recovered from the transformed function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the constant \\\\( c \\\\), it's impossible to accurately reverse the transformation and recover the exact form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) from \\\\( h(z) \\\\), as the adjustment made by \\\\( c \\\\) is indeterminate.",
