  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nGiven the final state \\( u(x, T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), or both), only by analyzing \\( u(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\( u(x, T) \\) can potentially be produced through different combinations of transformations and their interactions. The cumulative effect of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), alongside the natural evolution under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\), creates multiple potential scenarios, which makes it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions just from observing \\( u(x, T) \\).",
