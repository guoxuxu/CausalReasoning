  "Problem": "Consider a complex function governed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At} \\\\), where C is an initial complex constant and A is a complex matrix. Evaluate the effects when applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan the initial factor C be uniquely determined by observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if we do not know whether transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If it is unknown whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, the function could either be \\\\( e^{AT}C \\\\) or \\\\( e^{(A+D)T}C \\\\). The ambiguity arising from not knowing the presence of D's effect means C cannot be uniquely determined without this information.",
