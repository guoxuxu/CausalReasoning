  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the influence of the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf at any time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(-t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the specific instance of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\to z(-t) \\\\) modifies the temporal argument, affecting the Fourier transform by potentially altering the frequency components. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) depends on the intervention applied.",
