  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) in a two-dimensional space. We inquire about the impacts via transformations represented by \\\\( g(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) and subsequent linear transformations \\\\( h(x, y) = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(x, y) = Ax \\\\) is applied after \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\), will the value of \\\\( z \\\\) computed from the final transformed coordinates depend solely on the original function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) and not on the transformations \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With both transformations \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\) applied sequentially, their effects are compounded in altering the coordinate inputs to the function \\\\( f \\\\). Therefore, the final \\\\( z \\\\) will be influenced by these transformations, not solely by \\\\( f \\\\) on the original coordinates.",
