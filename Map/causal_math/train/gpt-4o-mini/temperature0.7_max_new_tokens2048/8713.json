  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) is transformed to the matrix \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), will the eigenvalues remain the same?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\) is a similarity transformation, which preserves the eigenvalues of the matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \\\\( A \\\\) will be the same as those of \\\\( T(A) \\\\).",
