  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system described by a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Examine the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-kt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a different complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( s \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new modifying factor, where \\\\( k \\\\) influences the integral transformation. This makes the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), dependent not only on the original constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the differential equation but also significantly on \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\). The nature of the complex integral transformations affects the trajectory and endpoint.",
