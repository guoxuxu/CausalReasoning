  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf an additional exponential decay \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Laplace Transform, will the result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The composition of \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) prior to the Laplace Transform changes the resulting function to \\\\( Z(s) = x\\frac{1}{s+\\alpha-i\\omega} \\\\). This reveals that both \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) influence the outcome, showing dependency on the decay rate \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) as well as the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
