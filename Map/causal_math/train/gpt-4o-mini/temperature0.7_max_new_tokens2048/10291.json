  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) which is a complex exponential representing oscillatory behavior with a constant \\\\( C \\\\) and angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\). An operator \\\\( T \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as follows: \\\\( Tz(t) = z(t + h) \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a time-shift constant.\n\nIf an additional operator \\\\( U \\\\) defined by \\\\( Uz(t) = z(t - k) \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant time-shift) is applied as an intervention at t = \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and T > k depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U \\\\) adds an opposing time-shift effect, thereby further modifying the trajectory of the system along with the earlier time-shift by \\\\( T \\\\). Thus, the final state at time T depends on both time shifts (\\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\)), as well as the underlying frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), leading to a complex interplay of shift interactions.",
