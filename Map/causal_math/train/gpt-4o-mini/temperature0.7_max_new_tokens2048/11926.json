  "Problem": "Assume a differential equation governing the temperature \\\\( T \\\\) of a body over time is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant and \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature. Now consider a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + h \\\\) applied at some initial time, where \\\\( h \\\\) represents a heating intervention.\n\nIf another intervention \\\\( g(T) = T - c \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant cooling effect) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the initial temperature without considering the effects of \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations \\\\( f(T) \\\\) and \\\\( g(T) \\\\) influences the thermal trajectory. Both interventions change the baseline from which the temperature adjusts towards \\\\( T_{env} \\\\). As such, the final temperature depends on both the original temperature and the alterations made by \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\).",
