  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the outcome when the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is used, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nCan one infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the computation to revert \\\\( z(T) \\\\) back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) neglects the exponential scaling inflicted by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), potentially leading to a misinterpretation of the initial state due to the lack of information about the scaling factor.",
