  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we exactly determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( p(x) \\\\), \\\\( r(x) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of Gaussian functions in the Fourier transform (specifically their convolution resulting in summation of exponents), it is challenging to uniquely identify and separate the effects of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Decomposing the combined effect into individual components is non-trivial without additional information.",
