  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This function is transformed by the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\} \\\\). We explore whether causal relationships about the properties of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can be discerned from the transformed function.\n\nIf a constant \\\\( b \\\\) is added to the exponent in the time-domain function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(a+b)t} \\\\) during the observation period, will the Laplace transform have its pole shifted solely by \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding \\\\( b \\\\) to the exponent modifies the function to \\\\( e^{(a+b)t} \\\\), whose Laplace transform results in a pole at \\\\( s = -(a+b) \\\\), indicating a direct shift due to the additive intervention of \\\\( b \\\\) in the exponent.",
