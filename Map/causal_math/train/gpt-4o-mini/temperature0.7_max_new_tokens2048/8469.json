  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) \\) evolving over time according to \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\) applied at different time points.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(z) \\) modifies the initial condition by introducing an additional phase rotation of \\( e^{it} \\) at t = 0. This initial phase shift changes the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\), leading to a different result at time T compared to direct evolution under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\).",
