  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The effect of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\), is applied to analyze the frequency components of z(t).\n\nIf an intervention modifies z(t) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing its frequency to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), will the Fourier Transform of the new function still show only the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) introduced by the intervention will adjust the frequency spectrum, manifesting both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) in the Fourier Transform result, depending on when the modification occurs and how it alters the existing frequency.",
