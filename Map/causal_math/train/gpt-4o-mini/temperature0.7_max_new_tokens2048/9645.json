  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\) without any further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(x) \\) initially transforms the state by a complex exponential factor, which affects the system’s trajectory. The transformation \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) introduces a rotation in the complex plane, altering the evolution of the state which is further compounded by the system dynamics under M, leading to a different state at time T.",
