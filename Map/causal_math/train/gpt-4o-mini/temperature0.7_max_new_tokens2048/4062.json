  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\}(s) = F(s)\\\\). We evaluate how a convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) impacts the transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nGiven only the transformed output \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\), the exact recovery of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) becomes impossible because the shift induced by \\\\( a \\\\) in the transform cannot be accurately inverted to regain \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
