  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a(x,t) u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\) is a function describing the velocity at point x and time t. We examine the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i x \\\\xi} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then the system evolves according to the given partial differential equation without further intervention, will the Fourier transform at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,T)\\\\), reflect the solution of the initial PDE directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the system's initial condition and allowing it to evolve according to the PDE, the characteristics of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) transform predictably under the Fourier transform, reflecting the linear advection dictated by \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\). The integral transform encodes the initial conditions and the system dynamics effectively.",
