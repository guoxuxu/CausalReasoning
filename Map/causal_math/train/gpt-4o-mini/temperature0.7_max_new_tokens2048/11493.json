  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{Aw} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and w is a complex variable. Suppose we perform an integral transformation on z(w) given by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sw}z(w) dw \\\\), where s is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is mapped using the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) from w = 0 to w = t without any additional modifications, will \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time t = T be influenced solely by constant A?",
  "Explanation": "While A directly influences the form of \\\\( z(w) \\\\), the integral transformation involves another complex constant s, which impacts how \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is integrated over the interval [0, t]. Thus, \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) also depends on s as well as A.",
