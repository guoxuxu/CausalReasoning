  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform of a function g(t) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = G(s) \\\\). We analyze how applying different initial conditions affects the inverse transform at a specific time T, where the initial conditions are modified by a constant k.\n\nIf we modify the initial conditions by a multiplier k at t = 0 in the function h(t) = g(t)k, and then compute the inverse Laplace transform without further intervention, will the function h(T) be k times the function g(T) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling property of the Laplace transform states that multiplying the time-domain function by a constant k results in the same scaling in transformed domain. Thus, the inverse Laplace transform returns the function h(T) = k * g(T).",
