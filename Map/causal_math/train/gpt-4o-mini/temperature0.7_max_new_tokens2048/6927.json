  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = c(t) + id(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf at some time t, a modification via convolution with function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then the Fourier transform is taken, is \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) affected only by the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not by \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) changes the signal. Due to the convolution theorem, the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) of the modified signal will differ since it becomes the product of \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( F(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). This shows the significant effect of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) on the resulting Fourier spectrum.",
