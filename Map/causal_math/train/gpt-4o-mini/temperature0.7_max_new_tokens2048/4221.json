  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) changes the initial conditions of both real and imaginary components of \\\\(z_0\\\\), affecting how the function evolves under the given differential equations. The phase factor introduced can shift the trajectory of the function, thus altering \\\\(z(T)\\\\) from what would have been if no transformation was applied.",
