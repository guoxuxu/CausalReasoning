  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function z(t) measures the temperature at a point in space, evolving according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We consider the impact of a time-varying boundary condition applied as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) where B is a constant scalar.\n\nIf a new boundary condition \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) (where C is another constant scalar) is applied at time \\\\(t1\\\\), does the final temperature distribution z(T) for T > t1 depend only on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The new boundary condition further modifies z, which already has been influenced by B. The final state z(T) will depend on all parameters—\\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), B, and C—because each affects z in a compounded manner over different intervals of time; B from 0 to \\\\(t1\\\\), and C from \\\\(t1\\\\) to T.",
