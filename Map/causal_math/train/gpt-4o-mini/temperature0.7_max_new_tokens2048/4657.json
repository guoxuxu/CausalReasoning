  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) undergoes transformations described by multiplication with matrices. We analyze the sequence where \\\\(x_0\\\\) is first multiplied by matrix \\\\(P\\\\) and then matrix \\\\(Q\\\\) over period t, expressed as \\\\(x(t) = QP x_0\\\\). A new transformation matrix \\\\(R\\\\) can be used as an intervention.\n\nIf vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) is initially transformed by \\\\(P\\\\) followed by \\\\(Q\\\\), and let to evolve under the sequence \\\\(x(t) = QP x_0\\\\) without further intervention, will the result at t = T for some T > 0 be equivalently achieved by directly applying \\\\(QP\\\\) to \\\\(x_0\\\\) without separately applying \\\\(P\\\\) and then \\\\(Q\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since matrix multiplication is associative, the application of \\\\(P\\\\) followed by \\\\(Q\\\\) (i.e., \\\\(Q(Px_0)\\\\) which equals \\\\(QP x_0\\\\)) is equivalent to the direct application of \\\\(QP\\\\). Thus, the sequence does not alter the end outcome compared to the direct application of \\\\(QP\\\\).",
