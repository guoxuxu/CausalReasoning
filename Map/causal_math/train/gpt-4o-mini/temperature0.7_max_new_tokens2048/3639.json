  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle moving along a line is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant coefficient. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) operated on the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and its impact over time t.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), with \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) alters the trajectory initiated by \\\\( h(x) \\\\). The state at any later time, including \\\\( T \\\\), will reflect both the initial and the intervened transformations. Hence, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) transformations.",
