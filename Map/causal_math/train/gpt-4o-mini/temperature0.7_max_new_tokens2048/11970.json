  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem associated with the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space. The operator is defined by the differential equation \\\\(L[u] = -y'' + q(x)y \\\\) on the interval \\\\([0, 1]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(y(0) = y(1) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q(x)\\\\) is a potential function.\n\nIf an external potential \\\\(p(x)\\\\) is introduced into the system after some eigenvalues \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are already calculated, will the subsequent eigenvalues only reflect the effects of \\\\(q(x)\\\\) rather than \\\\(p(x) + q(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an external potential modifies the entire eigenvalue spectrum, as the potential directly contributes to the differential operator. The new eigenvalues will reflect the composite effect of both \\\\(p(x)\\\\) and \\\\(q(x)\\\\).",
