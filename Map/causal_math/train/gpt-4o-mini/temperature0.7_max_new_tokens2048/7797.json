  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, resistor, and capacitor arranged in series (RLC circuit). The voltage across the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L, R, C \\\\) are constants and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is the input voltage function. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to the input voltage function.\n\nIf the input voltage function \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is modified using the Laplace Transform to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V)(s) \\\\), and then the circuit is allowed to operate under its differential equation without further alteration, will the current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) at time t follow the same path as if \\\\( V(t) \\\\) was directly applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform changes the frequency-domain representation of the input voltage and thus alters the entire solution of the differential equation in the time-domain. The system's response in terms of current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) will correspond to the inverse of the transformed voltage, thus altering the original current path.",
