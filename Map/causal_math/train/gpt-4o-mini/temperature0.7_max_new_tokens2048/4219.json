  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is an input function. We study how manipulations through a specific function \\\\( g(x) = x + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, influence the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by again applying a function \\\\( h(x) = x - d \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( y(T) \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), depend only on the kernel function \\\\( K \\\\) and not on the interventions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's output at \\\\( T \\\\) will incorporate effects of both interventions. Since each adjustment alters the input which then influences the integral, \\\\( y(T) \\\\) will involve a layered effect of both \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) added to the input function via the integral, affecting the outcome in a compound manner.",
