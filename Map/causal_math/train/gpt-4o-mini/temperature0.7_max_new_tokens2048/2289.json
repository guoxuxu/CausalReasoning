  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. This function describes a circle in the complex plane over time. We investigate the impacts of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then let to evolve under its original dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T still represent a circular motion in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the original trajectory by introducing an exponential growth or decay factor depending on the real part of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The trajectory will no longer strictly represent circular motion, but rather a spiral depending on the nature of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
