  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) is used to describe the time evolution of a system in the complex plane, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing it evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), can we determine whether \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "If only the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) are known, it is not possible to conclusively determine if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was squared, since multiple initial conditions can evolve into the same endpoint. The squaring could lead to multiple potential initial conditions or trajectories.",
