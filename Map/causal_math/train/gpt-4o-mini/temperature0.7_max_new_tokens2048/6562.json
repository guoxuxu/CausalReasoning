  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing model driven by a linear time-invariant system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) governed by its Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. The impact of a Fourier transform modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) on the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the system, can it be inferred if the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was modulated by \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), assuming no additional knowledge about \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on the original input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or the modulation frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), numerous combinations of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) could result in the same output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), due to the transformation properties and convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
