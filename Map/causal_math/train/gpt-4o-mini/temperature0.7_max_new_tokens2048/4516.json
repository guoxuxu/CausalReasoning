  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\), where M represents a square matrix. We explore the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) at some initial condition and examine its impact on system dynamics.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively ascertain whether an initial Fourier transform or its inverse was applied at any time, knowing only the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from numerous potential transformations and their inverses, applying at different instances. Deductive certainty about the specific transformations applied is unattainable without additional data indicating the precise interventions.",
