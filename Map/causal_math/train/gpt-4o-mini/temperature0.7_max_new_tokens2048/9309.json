  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant parameter. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), particularly focusing on changes over time in the spectral domain defined by \\\\( k \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) initially and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation, will the resultant function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for some time T match the Fourier transform of directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) under the said equation?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, the Fourier transform of the heat equation solution commutes with the evolution under the heat equation itself, which means the transformation in spectral space directly corresponds with transformation in the physical space over time. The linearity and transform properties of the equation preserve this relationship.",
