  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\xi t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applies a phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) leading to \\\\(z'(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)}\\\\) prior to the Fourier transform, will the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the transformed domain still be unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of a phase shift, while altering the time domain presentation of the signal, does not affect the frequency component under the Fourier transform. The frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) remains preserved, with the transform only modifying the complex phase in the frequency domain, not the location or the presence of the frequency component.",
