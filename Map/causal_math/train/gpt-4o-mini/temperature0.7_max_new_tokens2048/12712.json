  "Problem": "Examine the steady-state behavior of a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real valued function satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) for a constant matrix A, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. Consider the Fourier transform applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and its interactions.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves without any external intervention, does the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) differ from the Fourier transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) multiplied by the Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the Fourier transform of the product of two functions (\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\)) is the convolution of their Fourier transforms. Here, the Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) acts like a delta function shifting the spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Thus, the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) equates exactly to the shift of the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
