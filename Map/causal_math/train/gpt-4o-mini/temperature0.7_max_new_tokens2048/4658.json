  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) undergoes transformations described by multiplication with matrices. We analyze the sequence where \\\\(x_0\\\\) is first multiplied by matrix \\\\(P\\\\) and then matrix \\\\(Q\\\\) over period t, expressed as \\\\(x(t) = QP x_0\\\\). A new transformation matrix \\\\(R\\\\) can be used as an intervention.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(x(T) = QP x_0\\\\) at some time T, can we determine the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether transformations were performed stepwise (first \\\\(P\\\\), then \\\\(Q\\\\)) or directly as \\\\(QP\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of how the transformations were applied—either stepwise or directly—the result \\\\(x(T)\\\\) remains the same (\\\\(QP x_0\\\\)). If \\\\(QP\\\\) is invertible, given \\\\(x(T)\\\\), one can compute \\\\(x_0 = (QP)^{-1}x(T)\\\\), regardless of the method of application of \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\).",
