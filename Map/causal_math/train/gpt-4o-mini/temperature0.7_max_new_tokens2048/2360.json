  "Problem": "Consider the environment described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(w) = Aw + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants, on the evolution of this function over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\( T(w) \\\\), \\\\( U(w) \\\\), or both) and their parameters were used only by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of A, B, D, E, and even different intervention timings could potentially lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The nature of complex transformations and their non-trivial interaction with the dynamic function \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) create ambiguities in recovering the exact sequence and parameters of interventions.",
