  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) for a later time T follow the same evolution as predicted by the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the heat equation leads to a simpler expression in the frequency domain where the system evolves as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -k \\\\xi^2 \\\\hat{u} \\\\). The evolution in the frequency domain is consistent with the heat equation, merely transformed into this new representation.",
