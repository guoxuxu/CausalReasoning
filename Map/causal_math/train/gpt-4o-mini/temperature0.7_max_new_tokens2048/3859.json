  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, subjected to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) over time t, where S is a complex constant. We are analyzing how this transformation interacts with the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is another complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention applying a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where Q is another complex constant) is done at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for t = T > t_1 depend only on M, not on S or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on S, Q, and M. The sequence of transformations implemented through \\\\( e^{St} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) affects the trajectory leading to a final state that is influenced by each of these parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation f(z) influences the value of z at time t, which in turn affects the value of z at the endpoint T. The differential equation governed by M also influences z at time t. The intervention applying g(z) at time t1 affects the value of z at time t, which subsequently influences z at the endpoint T. However, the endpoint z(T) is ultimately determined by M, independent of S or Q.",
