  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\cdot x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a fixed complex vector, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number. The function governs the time evolution in a complex function space and represents a circular motion in the complex plane. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the given function without any intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some time T be uniquely determined by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\), not depending on \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) explicitly depends on the values of \\\\( T \\\\) as it appears in the exponential term, indicating a direct dependency on the time variable for determining the state in the complex function space.",
