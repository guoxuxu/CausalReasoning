  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and the function maps a real value \\\\(t\\\\) to a point on the complex unit circle. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Az\\\\), where A is a complex square matrix, at different times.\n\nCan we unambiguously deduce the initial value \\\\(z_0\\\\) from the observed transformation at any later time \\\\(t\\\\) if the system was subjected to \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at the beginning without knowing the details of \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstruction of \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(Az(t)\\\\) without explicit knowledge of \\\\(A\\\\) is generally not feasible since the transformation can significantly alter the trajectory and phase of the state, especially without commutativity between \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).",
