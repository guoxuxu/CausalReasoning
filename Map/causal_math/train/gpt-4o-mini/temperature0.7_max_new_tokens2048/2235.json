  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf a function modification characterized by a real shift transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is real is applied at some time before applying \\\\(T\\\\), will the characteristic frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) change in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the shift transformation results in the modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}z(t) = e^{at}e^{i\\\\omega t} = e^{(a + i\\\\omega)t} \\\\). When the Laplace transform is applied to this modified function, it yields \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - (a + i\\\\omega)}\\\\). While the location of the pole changes in the complex plane, the imaginary part, indicating the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), remains the same.",
