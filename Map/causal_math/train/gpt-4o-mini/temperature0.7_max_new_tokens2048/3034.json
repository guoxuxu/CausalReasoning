  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} ds \\\\), which is an integral transformation. We assess the behavior and relationships of this function under different transformations \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nObserving a bounded value of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we infer that \\\\( z \\\\) has a positive real part?",
  "Explanation": "A bounded value of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) implies that the exponential function in the integral decays sufficiently as \\\\( s \\\\) approaches infinity. This requires the real part of \\\\( z \\\\) to be positive to ensure decay and the boundedness of the integral.",
