  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nIf \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is given and evolves according to the PDE without any intervention, will the population distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be equivalent to that determined strictly by the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under the diffusion process?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for any \\\\( t > 0 \\\\) is solely dependent on its initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under the given diffusion equation without any external alteration, ensuring the dependence only on initial conditions as per the properties of diffusion PDEs.",
