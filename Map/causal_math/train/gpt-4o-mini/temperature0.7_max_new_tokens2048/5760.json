  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar.\n\nCan one determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) were applied by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, knowing only the differential equations but no other details?",
  "Explanation": "While transformations like \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) distinctly scale the state, the overlapping effects of these exponential functions can obscure which were actually applied. Different initial conditions and different times or strengths of transformation application can yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under the given differential constraints.",
