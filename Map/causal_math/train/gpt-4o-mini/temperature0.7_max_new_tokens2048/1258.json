  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex constant, in the context of an integral transformation. We are particularly interested in the causality analysis between transformations and original functions.\n\nCan the source term A be uniquely determined from the result of the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) without any external information?",
  "Explanation": "The form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) distinctly maps back to \\\\( A \\\\) as the pole of the Laplace transform, uniquely identifying the original exponential term. This precise back-tracking is definitive unless there is additional convolution or manipulation.",
