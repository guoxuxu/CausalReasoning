  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(du/dt = Au\\\\) and \\\\(dv/dt = Bv\\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) is applied, where C is a constant scalar.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the separate dynamics \\\\(du/dt = Au\\\\) and \\\\(dv/dt = Bv\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under separate dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the initial conditions of both \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\), changing their trajectories. The multiplier \\\\(e^{Ct}\\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) in a way different from the untransformed situation, which results in a different state at time T.",
