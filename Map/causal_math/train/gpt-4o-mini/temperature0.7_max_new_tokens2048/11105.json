  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let's explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without further manipulation, will the transformed function \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly integrating t^2 + i \\\\cdot t from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) directly evaluates the integral of the input function from 0 to t, so applying it to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) simply results in the integral of t^2 + i \\\\cdot t up to time T. Thus, it will directly equate to \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\).",
