  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a wave propagating in space and time. We analyze this system after performing a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to the frequency domain.\n\nIf an initial waveform \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is Fourier transformed to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was directly evolved to T under the same equation?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the Fourier transform is linear and reversible, preserving the propagation properties in the frequency domain as it does in the spatial domain. The evolution remains consistent with the initial conditions, just represented in a different domain.",
