  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. Analyze the effect of applying a linear time-invariant system transformation characterized by the impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) for \\\\(t \\\\geq 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\), and the value of the resistance change \\\\(R'\\\\), can we determine definitively whether the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even knowing the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) and the resistance change \\\\(R'\\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine if the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was applied. The system's linearity and the overlapping effects from varying initial conditions and resistance changes obscure the exact cause.",
