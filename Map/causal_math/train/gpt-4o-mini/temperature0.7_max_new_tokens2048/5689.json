  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) representing a solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at different times \\\\( t \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the transformed function is evolved under the transformed equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\hat{L}(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\), will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) for a given T strictly equal the Fourier transform of the function obtained by directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is a linear and time-invariant transformation, and given that the transformed equation accurately reflects the dynamics under \\\\( L \\\\), the evolution of \\\\( \\\\hat{u} \\\\) will correspond to the Fourier transform of the solution by direct evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).",
