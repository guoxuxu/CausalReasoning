  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant, under various conditions where the function is transformed by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve by the given function without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) modifies the initial value from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\). Thus, the new trajectory will follow \\\\( (z_0^2) e^{iwt} \\\\), which is not the same as simply evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to become \\\\( z_0 e^{iwt} \\\\) under the original function.",
