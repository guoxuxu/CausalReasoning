  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz + u \\\\) with \\\\( u \\\\) being a control function and \\\\( D \\\\) a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a constant function applied from t = 0 onwards without any further modification, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), at a certain \\\\( s \\\\) reflect only the dynamics governed by \\\\( D \\\\) without the influence of \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The control function \\\\( u \\\\) directly influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it adds to the homogeneous solution of the differential equation. Consequently, \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depends not only on the eigenstructure of \\\\( D \\\\) but also significantly on \\\\( u \\\\). The integration involves both parts, and it cannot neglect the contribution from \\\\( u \\\\).",
