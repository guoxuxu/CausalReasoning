  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing a circular trajectory in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of a transformation implemented by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t and its effects on the system.\n\nGiven the final point \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to ascertain whether the observed transformations in magnitude and phase at \\\\( t = T \\\\) are due solely to natural evolution or a combination of evolution and initial transformation by \\\\( f(z) \\\\). This uncertainty is due to the irreversible nature of squaring in the complex plane.",
