  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\beta \\\\) is a constant different from \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be only dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive interventions with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) add layers of complexity due to exponential scaling factors affecting both the magnitude and the trajectory phase. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on \\\\( \\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\beta \\\\).",
