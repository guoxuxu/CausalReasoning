  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We investigate the causal relationships under transformations by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a non-zero integer.\n\nCan we ascertain the exponent k from observing the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T, knowing it underwent a transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at x_0?",
  "Explanation": "If we can measure the rate of rotation and compare it to the expected rate from \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\), we can infer the value of k as it affects the frequency of oscillation in the complex exponential function.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The variable x causes the transformation of x into z(x), which subsequently causes the transformation of z(x) into g(z). The behavior of g(z) at x_0 is influenced by the transformation of z(x), which is dependent on the original variable x. The variable T causes the evaluation of z(T) and this behavior may provide insights into the exponent k.",
