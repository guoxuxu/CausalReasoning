  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a divergence-free condition. Study the effect of introducing a scalar field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) = T(x)e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), where T(x) represents a temperature distribution and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a growth rate, on heat transfer characteristics of the flow.\n\nIf a control is applied at time t1 to modulate the flow using a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, t) = -k\\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\), where k is a constant, will the temperature distribution at T, for T > t1, solely rely on the initial profiles and \\\\( lambda \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, t) \\\\) modifies the flow dynamics significantly, affecting how the temperature is transported and diffused throughout the domain. This intervention means the final temperature profile depends not only on the initial state and \\\\( lambda \\\\) but also on the intervention factor \\\\( k \\\\).",
