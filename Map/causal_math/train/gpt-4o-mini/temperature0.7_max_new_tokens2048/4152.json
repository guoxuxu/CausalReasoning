  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on \\( z(t) \\), defined by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\).\n\nBased on the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{\\tilde{z}\\}(s) \\) of the modified function \\( \\tilde{z}(t) = h(t)z(t) \\), can it be determined what specific intervention \\( h(t) \\) was applied, along with the structures of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{\\tilde{z}\\}(s) \\) provides an integral mixture of the effects of \\( h(t) \\), A, and B. Without a priori knowledge about the nature of \\( h(t) \\) or the explicit forms of A and B, it is virtually impossible to disentangle and uniquely determine all these contributions from \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{\\tilde{z}\\}(s) \\) alone.",
