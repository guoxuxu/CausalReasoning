  "Problem": "Analyze a stochastic process where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BX dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( dW \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process. Consider the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{CX} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) be inferred exactly from observing \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic nature of the differential equation combined with the potential unknown application of \\\\( e^{CX} \\\\) to the initial state results in multiple possible initial states that could have led to the observed \\\\( X(T) \\\\). The uncertainty in initial transformation obscures the back-calculations.",
