  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by two variables x and y, related by the complex function \\( z = x + yi \\). We look into how the function \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z \\, ds \\) influences z over time t, where A is a constant complex number.\n\nHaving observed the state \\( z(t) \\) at t = T, can we conclusively trace back to determine the original state \\( z_0 \\) without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\( f(z) \\), the transformation \\( \\int_0^t e^{sA}z \\, ds \\) could have shifted the starting point significantly. Depending on A's value, this transformation could result in various possible initial states \\( z_0 \\), making unique determination infeasible.",
