  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real variables. This function is subjected to a Laplace Transformation over the variable \\\\( t \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency domain variable.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), a new complex constant \\\\( c \\\\) is introduced changing the function to \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + ct} \\\\), will the endpoint Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, T)\\\\} \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) or will it also depend on \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( c \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the function's dependence on \\\\( t \\\\) from \\\\( b \\\\) to \\\\( c \\\\). Therefore, the new Laplace Transform of the function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) will reflect this change, resulting in a dependency on \\\\( c \\\\), indicated by \\\\( \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - c} \\\\).",
