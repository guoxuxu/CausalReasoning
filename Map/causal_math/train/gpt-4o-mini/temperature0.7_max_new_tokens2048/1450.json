  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t represents time. We investigate the influence of a Fourier transformation on this function, represented as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) over the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and observed frequency components, can we conclusively determine the time-varying behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without taking the inverse transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform shifts the information about time-domain behavior into the frequency domain, and without performing the inverse Fourier transformation, specifics of the time-domain behavior (like exact time-evolving phases or modifications in amplitude over time) remain indeterminate.",
