  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex-valued functions defined in the complex plane and the application of the Laplace transform, which is represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Analyze the behavior and relationships when these functions are subjected to transformations like multiplication by a constant or modification by an exponential decay factor.\n\nGiven a transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{K}{s-a} \\\\) where K is unknown, can we determine the exact scaling factor K and confirm the specific intervention applied only by knowing \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{K}{s-a} \\\\), while it can be deduced that the original function involves \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), the precise value of K cannot be uniquely determined just from the transformed function. Further information about initial conditions or specific values of the function at select points would be needed.",
