  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, does the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) impact the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial values of z, specifically, scaling both real and imaginary components by a factor dependent on t. This transformation adjusts the trajectory of both x and y components under their respective differential equations, thus impacting the state at any future time T.",
