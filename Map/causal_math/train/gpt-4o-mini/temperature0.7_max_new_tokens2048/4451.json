  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The system undergoes an operation defined by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}e^{Mt}Ux \\\\), where U is a constant, invertible matrix, and t is the time variable.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( g(x) = V^{-1}e^{Mt}Vx \\\\) (where V is another constant invertible matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the resulting \\\\( x(T) \\\\) rely solely on M and not on U or V?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) as an intervention introduces a further transformation that modifies the trajectory, rendering the system's endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on U, V, as well as M. The matrix V especially affects system state since its introduction at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) uniquely alters the resulting system state at any time T > t_1.",
