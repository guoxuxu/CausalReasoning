  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time is investigated.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)g(t)\\\\} (s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the intervention \\\\( g(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied, based solely on the transform outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)g(t)\\\\} (s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\) explicitly indicates an additional term \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) in the exponent, which can only result from the multiplicative intervention function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), revealing that an intervention indeed occurred.",
