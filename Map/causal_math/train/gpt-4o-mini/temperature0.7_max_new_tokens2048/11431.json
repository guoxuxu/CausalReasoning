  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. This transformation applies to a signal analysis context where the function represents a wave. Suppose we apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) at some point.\n\nSuppose a phase shifting operation \\\\( z(t) \\\\to e^{i\\\\theta}z(t) \\\\) is applied at some time t = 1, will the spectrum at time T > 1 show influence only from the original transformation and ignore the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift intervention \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) alters the phase but not the frequency of the signal. The Fourier spectrum will still depict the same frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) but the phase information will differ reflecting the intervention. Hence, both the original transformation and the intervention influence the final spectrum.",
