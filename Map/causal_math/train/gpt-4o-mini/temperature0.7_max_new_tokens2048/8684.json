  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nCan the specific functions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) used be uniquely determined based solely on observing the altered spectrum of \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions such as \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) merely through the final spectrum is highly challenging due to potential overlaps in the spectral effects caused by different functional forms of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\). Multiple combinations of these functions could result in similar spectral modifications, thus specific identification is not feasible without additional data.",
