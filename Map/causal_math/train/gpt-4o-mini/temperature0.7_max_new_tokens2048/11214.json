  "Problem": "Consider a system in a complex plane characterized by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which must hold for a function \\\\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\\\) to be analytic in a region. Let \\\\( T \\\\) represent a transformation where \\\\( T(z) = z^2 \\\\) and explore this transformation's effect on the analytic properties of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nGiven an analytic function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and its transformed counterpart \\\\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\\\), can we determine if every point in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations knowing that \\\\( g(z) \\\\) does?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\\\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, so must \\\\( f(z) \\\\), since the transformation \\\\( z^2 \\\\) does not disrupt the analyticity of \\\\( f \\\\) inherent in its derivative's existence.",
