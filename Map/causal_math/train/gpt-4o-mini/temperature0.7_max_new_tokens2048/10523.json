  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. This function models a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). Additionally, analyze the impact of a Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), and its implications on causality inferences.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Laplace transform calculated at any \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) exclusively reflect this new \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) and not the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) results in a new system function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function will reflect the new value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), indicated by the pole of the transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\), effectively overwriting the earlier behavior.",
