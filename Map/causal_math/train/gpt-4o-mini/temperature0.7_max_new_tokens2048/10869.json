  "Problem": "Consider a vibrating mechanical system that can be mathematically modeled as a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping ratio and natural frequency respectively. Suppose an external impulse given by the function \\\\(f(t) = \\\\delta(t - t_0)\\\\) (Dirac delta function) applies at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nIf the external impulse \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is applied at \\\\(t_0\\\\) without any subsequent intervention, does it affect the frequency of oscillation of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The external impulse changes the initial conditions (specifically the velocity due to its impulsive nature), but it does not alter the system's natural frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), as this is a property dependent purely on the system's physical parameters.",
