  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect the effects on the function when it is subjected to a Fourier transformation, given by \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the modified output \\( F(h)(\\xi) \\), can we conclusively trace back and identify the exact form of the intervention \\( h(t) \\), knowing only \\( \\xi \\) at which \\( F(h)(\\xi) \\) peaks?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the modified function due to intervention \\( h(t) \\) results in various components that could be due to multiple potential transformations of the original \\( z(t) \\). Without additional information about the nature of the time modulation \\( t \\cdot z(t) \\), the specific intervention cannot be uniquely identified from the spectral peaks alone, especially if other viable transformations could produce similar frequency shifts or spreads.",
