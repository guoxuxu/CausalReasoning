  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (A u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a state variable and \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant vector field. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), which changes \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) to its frequency domain representation.\n\nCan we determine the original initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) perfectly after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "Without being certain whether the Fourier transform was applied, we cannot confirm the exact initial condition just from analyzing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). Changes brought by switching between the spatial and frequency domains may not be completely reversible without explicit knowledge of all transformations applied.",
