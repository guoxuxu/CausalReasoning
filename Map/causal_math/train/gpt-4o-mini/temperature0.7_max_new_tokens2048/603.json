  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined over the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{aw^2 + bw} dw \\\\) where a and b are constants. We are interested in the causal influence of changes in parameters a and b, or transformations on w, on the resulting function values computed by z.\n\nIf at some intermediate time t1, a transformation on the variable w, defined as \\\\( w' = cw \\\\) for a constant c, is applied, will the resultant z(w) at time T be independent of the transformation applied at t1?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( w' = cw \\\\) affects the entire integration process by modifying the variable of integration. This scaling changes the nature of z(w) since the exponential terms inside the integral react sensitively to changes in w. Thus, z(w) at T depends on both the parameters a, b and the intermediate transformation.",
