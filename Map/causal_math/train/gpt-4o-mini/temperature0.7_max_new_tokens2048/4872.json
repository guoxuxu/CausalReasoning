  "Problem": "Let's consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the system's response under the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) for a constant k.\n\nKnowing only the value of \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely the sequence of transformations applied (whether \\\\(g(x)\\\\) at t = 0, \\\\(h(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\), or both) to reach this endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "The final position \\\\(x(T)\\\\) may correspond to multiple possible transformation sequences due to the similarities in how exponential scaling interacts with the harmonic oscillator. This similarity makes it impossible to uniquely determine whether one or both transformations were applied, or in which sequence, based solely on the final position.",
