  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a vibrating string given by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the speed of the wave in the string and \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). An external forcing term \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is added to the system, resulting in a modified equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + F(x,t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the displacement \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T observed in an experiment, can we determine whether a force \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) was applied at any earlier time without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without extra data or initial conditions, multiple potential forces could lead to the same observed displacement at time T, due to superposition and different possible interactions between the string's natural dynamics and external forces.",
