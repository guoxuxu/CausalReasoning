  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), which maps complex function input in the time domain to the frequency domain. An intervention involves altering the system by a complex function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) such that the new system's output is \\\\( Y(s) = X(s) \\\\cdot H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a unit step signal, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the absence of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) be equal to \\\\( X(s) \\\\) without any modification in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) remains identical to the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\), following the property of the identity transformation in the Laplace domain, which leaves \\\\( X(s) \\\\) unaltered.",
