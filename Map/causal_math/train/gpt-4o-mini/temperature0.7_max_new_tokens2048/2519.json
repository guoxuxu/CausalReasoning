  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The Laplace Transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how changes in the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) influence the transformed function over the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( h(t) = t^k e^{-at} \\\\) with \\\\( k \\\\) being a non-negative integer, will the influence of \\\\( a \\\\) on the modulus of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) \\\\) for all \\\\( s \\\\) with Re(s) > 0 remain undiminished?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional polynomial term \\\\( t^k \\\\) alters the decay characteristics of the function, affecting the Laplace Transform. While the transform remains influenced by \\\\( a \\\\), the relationship becomes more complex due to integration over the product of a polynomial and an exponential decay term, thus modifying the resulting transform’s sensitivity to changes in \\\\( a \\\\).",
