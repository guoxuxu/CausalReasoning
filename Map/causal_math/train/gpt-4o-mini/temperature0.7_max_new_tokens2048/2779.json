  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) on the complex plane, and we are studying its transformation through a complex contour integral \\\\(I(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u(z) dz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple, closed contour and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf a parameter adjustment function \\\\( g(t) = t^a \\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant) is applied to the integral at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), so the new integral becomes \\\\( I''(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{g(t)z} u(z) dz \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), will the outcome be independent of the original \\\\(k\\\\) in \\\\(u(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The adjusted parameter \\\\( g(t) \\\\) does not negate the dependency on the original power \\\\(k\\\\) of \\\\(z\\\\) in \\\\(u(z)\\\\). Instead, it modifies how the exponential term interacts with the contour path and \\\\(u(z)\\\\), adding or exposing additional dependencies based on both \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\).",
