  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the causal relationships when manipulating the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and analyzing its impact on the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using different transformations.\n\nIf, at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is suddenly changed to a new function \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) as a form of intervention, will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be completely independent of the input form before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the change at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T will still bear an imprint of the input from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) due to the cumulative nature of the integral operation, which aggregates the effects of past inputs up until \\\\( t_1 \\\\) along with the new input from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T.",
