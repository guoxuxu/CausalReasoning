  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transformed function after multiple Gaussian convolutions, can we deduce the specific sequence or values of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\sigma' \\\\) just by observing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The specific dampening effects on different frequency components can result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\sigma' \\\\), leading to multiple plausible scenarios that fit the observed data. The non-unique recovery of sequence or values from the Fourier transformed output precludes definitive inference.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The original function p(x) is convolved with a Gaussian kernel G(x; σ), which transforms it into a new function. This function is then subjected to a Fourier transform to create a convolved function. The convolved function influences the observed outcome. Additionally, the Gaussian kernel can vary with a different standard deviation σ', and this variation also leads to a different convolved function and observed outcome.",
