  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta \\\\\\\\ \\beta & \\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) are constants, on the state vector representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve over time without further intervention, will \\\\( Mt \\\\) for \\\\( t = T \\\\) solely determine the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The matrix \\\\( M \\\\) alters the initial conditions but does not solely dictate the state at time T since \\\\( z(t) \\\\) continues to evolve due to \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\). \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is consequently influenced by both the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the exponential rotation \\\\( e^{i \\omega T} \\\\).",
