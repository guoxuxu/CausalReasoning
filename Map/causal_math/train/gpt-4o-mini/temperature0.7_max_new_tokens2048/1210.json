  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). To further analyze or manipulate the signal, an operator \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven \\\\( x'(t) \\\\), the inverse Fourier Transform of \\\\( P(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\), without intervention, can we uniquely determine \\\\( x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the transformation by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\), which could be any modification (filter, shift, etc.), it is not possible to uniquely determine the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) as \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) could represent many possible operations.",
