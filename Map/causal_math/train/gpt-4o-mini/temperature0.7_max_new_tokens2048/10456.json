  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be accurately determined what interventions were used (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) solely from the final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different sequences or types of transformations due to the intertwining effects of squaring (increasing magnitude and affecting phase) and shifting (translating the trajectory). These interactions make it challenging to distinguish between and backtrack the specific interventions used.",
