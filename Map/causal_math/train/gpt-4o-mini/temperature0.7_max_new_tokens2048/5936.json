  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) obey the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. We explore the scenario by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > t_1 (after applying the perturbation \\\\( p(t) \\\\)), is it possible to infer the specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and constant B used in \\\\( p(t) \\\\) just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect observed at time T could result from varying the parameters B and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in different ways, due to the nature of exponential functions and differential equations. There are potentially multiple combinations of \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and B that could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making precise determination ambiguous.",
