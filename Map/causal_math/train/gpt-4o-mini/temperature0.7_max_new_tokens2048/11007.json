  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes analysis under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{mt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the original transformation parameter \\\\( k \\\\), the intervention parameter \\\\( m \\\\), and the system's inherent parameter \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). The transformations interact through compounded exponential scaling and phase shifting, distinctly impacting the system's state at time T.",
