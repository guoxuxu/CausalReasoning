  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k > 0 \\\\) is a constant. Analyses include transforming the function via \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the form of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T be solely dependent on the heat equation's constant \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) changes the initial conditions by multiplying them by \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\). This alteration affects how \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) evolves over time, introducing a dependency on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) in addition to the heat conductivity \\\\( k \\\\). Thus, the solution at time T is influenced by both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",
