  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving an integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. In this context, assume that \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), with A being a real constant. Further assume that the Laplace transform is uniquely invertible.\n\nBy observing the outcome of the Laplace transform, and assuming no modification to s, can we determine the specific value of A?",
  "Explanation": "Given the unique invertibility of the Laplace transform and the direct influence of A on the exponential form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), one can uniquely solve for A from the known transform result assuming s is unchanged and known.",
