  "Problem": "Consider a function modeled by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) where z is a complex number. We evaluate the effects of an additional transformation defined as \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the analytic function w.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at initial time, and then \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied without further modifications, will \\\\( w(g(z_0)) \\\\) be the same as just applying \\\\( w(z_0) \\\\) without the transformation \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\) alters the argument of the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{z + a} \\\\), which is not generally equal to \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) due to the properties of the exponential function in the complex plane. This changes the output significantly.",
