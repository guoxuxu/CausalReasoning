  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) only depend on the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the initial amplitude \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is \\\\( Z(s) = x\\frac{1}{s-i\\omega} \\\\), which clearly shows the dependency on both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The amplitude \\\\( x \\\\) scales the transformed function, indicating its effect on the outcome.",
