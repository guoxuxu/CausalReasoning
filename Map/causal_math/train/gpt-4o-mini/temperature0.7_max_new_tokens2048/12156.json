  "Problem": "Imagine a system where the temperature distribution on a plate is modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), and as an experiment, a function \\\\( h(u) = e^{-kt}u \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant) is applied at different times to alter the temperature pattern.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will the distribution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( h(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling the temperature distribution. As the Laplace equation governs steady-state conditions, the initial manipulation of the temperature directly determines the system's evolution to a new steady-state, making the distribution at time T different unless \\\\( k=0 \\\\).",
