  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system undergoes an integral transformation with \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). The resultant transform modifies the behavior of the initial function over time.\n\nIf a function adjustment \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\) is applied at time t as an intervention, where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a modified frequency, will the resultant state at time T be solely influenced by the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not by the intervention \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function's frequency from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), which means the transformed state at time T under \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) will be influenced by both the original and the intervenient frequencies. The output will reflect a combination of effects from both the initial and the adjusted frequencies.",
