  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of linear operators \\\\( L \\\\) on this system, defined by matrix multiplication on complex numbers in the form \\\\( Lz = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another linear operator \\\\( L' \\\\) defined by \\\\( L'z = Nz \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The series of transformations and evolution means that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) besides \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Specifically, the state at time T will be \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega (T-t_1)}N e^{i\\\\omega t_1}Mz_0 \\\\), which depends on the interplay between \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and the evolution operator.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex number z0 influences the state z(t), which in turn affects the state z(T). The angular frequency ω directly impacts the state z(t). The linear operator L, defined by matrix M, modifies the state z(t) to yield Lz, which also affects z(T). Similarly, the linear operator L', defined by matrix N, modifies the state z(t) to yield L'z, which influences z(T) as well.",
