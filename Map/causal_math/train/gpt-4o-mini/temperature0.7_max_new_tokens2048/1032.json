  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\), including their timings and specific parameters like C, can result in the same endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The overlap in potential effects from these transformations creates ambiguity, preventing an unequivocal inference of the interventions applied only from the end state.",
