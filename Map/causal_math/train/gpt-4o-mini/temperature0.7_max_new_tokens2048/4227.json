  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applies a change in the parameter \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( k' \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the new \\\\( k' \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( k \\\\) or the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by both the original parameter \\\\( k \\\\) until time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and by \\\\( k' \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. Additionally, if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied at some point, it integrates these effects over time, modifying the impact of both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( k' \\\\) on the eventual state at T.",
