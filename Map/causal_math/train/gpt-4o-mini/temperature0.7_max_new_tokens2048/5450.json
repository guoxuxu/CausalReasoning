  "Problem": "Explore the system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with a given constant matrix M. Consider the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and how different initial conditions affect the system. We assume M and s are such that all operations and the inverse transform are well-defined.\n\nKnowing \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), can one definitively trace back to find the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform applied to \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) can reconstruct the time-domain function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) uniquely, including the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\), provided the system and transformations are stable and all inverse operations are defined and applicable.",
