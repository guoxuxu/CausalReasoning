  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) defined on complex numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), with \\( f \\) being a holomorphic function. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) \\) concerning variable \\( y \\) and the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(w) \\) concerning variable \\( x \\) are used to analyze transformed functions.\n\nIf \\( f \\) is modified at a certain point \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) by introducing an additional term \\( g(x, y) \\), a holomorphic intervention, does the end transform only depend on the initial form of \\( f \\) or both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( g(x, y) \\) as an intervention in \\( f(x, y) \\) alters both the Fourier and Laplace transforms' results due to the linear yet independent impact on the input function. The final transform will reflect the characteristics of both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\).",
