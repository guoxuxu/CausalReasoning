  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function's behavior when subjected to Laplace Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and its transformation into the Laplace domain, defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the implications of altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and its effects on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additive intervention in the form of a damping factor, represented by \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha > 0 \\\\), is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain only be affected by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and not by any changes to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a damping factor changes \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), leading to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{(i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha)t}\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha - i\\\\omega} \\\\). Both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) affect the resultant Laplace transform, affecting the pole location through a combined translation in the complex plane.",
