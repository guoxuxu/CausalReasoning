  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time system represented by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( u(s) \\\\) a varying vector function of time. Study the effect of applying a temporal shift transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\), with \\\\( \\tau \\\\) a time shift constant and \\\\( B \\\\) another matrix.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new transformation \\\\( g(u) = e^{C\\sigma} u(t-\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is another time shift) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be only influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) and not by \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) = e^{C\\sigma} u(t-\\sigma) \\\\) further modifies the input function and thus changes the system's output integrally influenced by matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). Each transformation shifts and scales the input in different ways, affecting the resulting integration process and the system’s state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
