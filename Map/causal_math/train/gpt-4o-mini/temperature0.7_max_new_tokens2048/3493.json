  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and let the transformation be defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\theta t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being another real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval [0, T] without intervention, will the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be independent of the choice of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) for any T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends on the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), specifically on how \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\) relate. The integral results in a value that varies with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\), affecting the outcome based on the integral's sensitivity to these parameters.",
