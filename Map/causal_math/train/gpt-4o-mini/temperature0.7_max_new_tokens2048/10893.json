  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\) applied on a function F(s), and its subsequent inverse Laplace transformation to retrieve g(t). Analyze the influence of a linear differential operator \\( D \\), where \\( Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\) (a is a constant), on the transformed function and its retrieval.\n\nIf \\( D \\) is applied to \\( g(t) \\) before performing the inverse Laplace Transform, does the newly retrieved function \\( h(t) \\) remain the same as \\( g(t) \\) without applying \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( D \\) before the inverse transform changes the differential structure of the function. Specifically, the relationship within the Laplace domain becomes \\( sF(s) - sf(0) + aF(s) \\), thus altering \\( h(t) \\) from the original \\( g(t) \\), adding terms dependent on derivatives and scaled versions of the function.",
