  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). The system's evolution is examined under the impact of this transformation over time t.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations used (\\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\) or both) based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging since different combinations could lead to the same endpoint, particularly given the potential for phase and amplitude modifications by each matrix.",
