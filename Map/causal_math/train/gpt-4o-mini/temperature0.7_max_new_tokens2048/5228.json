  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, on the function over a time interval is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine precisely the initial function's parameters and the transformations applied only by observing the system’s state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state at \\\\( T \\\\) combines effects from the original differential equation and any transformations applied. Due to the overlap in potential influences and transformations like \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), identifying unique initial parameters or interventions from the final state alone is generally infeasible.",
