  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the system under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix performing a linear transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) changes the initial state vector from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). The system's trajectory changes due to this altered initial condition, hence \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T after transformation will differ from the trajectory beginning with the true initial condition unless M commutes perfectly with the exponential of D.",
