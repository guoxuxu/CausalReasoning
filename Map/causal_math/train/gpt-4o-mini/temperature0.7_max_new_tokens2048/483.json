  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The system is analyzed under the transformation defined by the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-At^2} \\\\).\n\nIf a new function \\\\( y(t) = e^{-Ct} \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention after computing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[h(t)] \\\\), will the new resultant function depend only on A and not C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new function \\\\( y(t) = e^{-Ct} \\\\) adds complexity based on the new matrix C, integrating into the existing transformed state brought about by A. The outcome would depend on both matrices A and C, potentially altering the behavior and final output of the system.",
