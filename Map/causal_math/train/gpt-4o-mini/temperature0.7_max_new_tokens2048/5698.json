  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) might have been shifted by \\\\( -\\\\theta \\\\), and since multiple initial conditions could result in the same \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to periodicity and phase shifts, \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
