  "Problem": "Investigate the stability of a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number denoting angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We consider the effect of an external transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we unambiguously determine the specific transformations applied (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of complex constants \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\), even if applied in different orders, can yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to properties of complex multiplication, making it impossible to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied, or in which order.",
