  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -kx\\\\), with a constant decay rate k. The impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\(L[f(t)](s)\\\\) on this system is explored, where \\\\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\\\). The transformation variable s is complex.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(L[f(t)](s)\\\\) of the system, can we uniquely recover the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and the constant k without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\frac{x_0}{s+k}\\\\), and from this form, one can uniquely determine the decay constant k and the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\) directly from the parameters in the transformed expression.",
