  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is subjected to the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nUpon observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T, can the initial complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 be accurately deduced without knowing whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at t = 0, and given the fact that both \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) influence the system dynamically, recovering the original \\\\(z_0\\\\) is not feasible. The transformed equation results in a different trajectory, affected by the exponential scaling factor \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\), complicating back-calculation to the original state.",
