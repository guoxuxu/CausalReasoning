  "Problem": "Consider a chemical reaction where the concentration of a substance \\\\( C(t) \\\\) evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dC}{dt} = kC \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a reaction rate constant. We analyze how applying a transformation \\\\( f(C) = e^{-kt}C \\\\) affects the system over time.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( C(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine if the transformation \\\\( f(C) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 purely based on \\\\( C(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( f(C) = e^{-kt}C \\\\) at t = 0 does not permanently change the concentration but reverses itself instantly, there are no remaining effects by T and thus \\\\( C(T) \\\\) appears as if no transformation was applied at all.",
