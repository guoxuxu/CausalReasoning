  "Problem": "Examine the effect of integrating a complex function using different contours in the complex plane. We consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) varies over different contours.\n\nKnowing only the nonzero value of the integral, can we trace back uniquely to the original contour shape before any deformation?",
  "Explanation": "The same integral result could be obtained from multiple different contours as long as they enclose the singularity \\\\( a \\\\) in the same way. Since the integral's value is invariant to the specific shape of the contour, the original shape cannot be uniquely determined from the integral result alone.",
