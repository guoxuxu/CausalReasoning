  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{-k^2 t} \\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform, on the temporal evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve without further intervention under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by applying a filtering effect that attenuates certain frequencies due to the operation \\\\( e^{-k^2 t} \\\\) in the Fourier domain. This change in the spectrum of the initial function generally results in different evolution under the diffusion equation, affecting the state at time T.",
