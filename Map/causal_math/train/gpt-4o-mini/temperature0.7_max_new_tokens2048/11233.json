  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and we study its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the transformed function maintain the same periodicity as the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation changes the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), effectively adding a phase shift and altering the frequency content due to the convolution with a decaying exponential. This causes a change in the periodicity of the original function.",
