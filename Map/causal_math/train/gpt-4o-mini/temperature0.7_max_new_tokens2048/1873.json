  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Pu\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) is a differential operator. Investigate how the introduction of a boundary condition using the function \\\\(h(u) = e^{Qt}u\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is another differential operator, affects the system.\n\nIf \\\\(h(u)\\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\(u_0\\\\) and then the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Pu\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be equivalent to the state if \\\\(u_0\\\\) were evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Pu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the \\\\(h(u)\\\\) boundary condition modifies the initial state by redefining \\\\(u(0)\\\\) as \\\\(e^{Qt}u_0\\\\). Since \\\\(e^{Qt}\\\\) affects the initial condition, the evolution of \\\\(u(t)\\\\) under \\\\(P\\\\) will follow a different path compared to starting from \\\\(u_0\\\\) without modification.",
