  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex number. Analyze the mappings when transformed by this exponential function in the complex plane, considering different paths in the complex plane.\n\nDoes the contour of integration in the complex plane alter the result of \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) where C is a closed contour, and no intervention is made during integration?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the residue theorem and the properties of exponential functions in the complex plane, the result of the integral can depend on the particular path of C, especially if it encircles poles or essential singularities. The nature of the exponential function potentially alters the contour integral.",
