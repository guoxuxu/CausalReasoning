  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = \\log(z(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\log \\\\) denotes the complex logarithm. Consider the effects of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven a trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) over time, can we uniquely identify the initial conditions of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and parameters of \\\\( T \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The complex logarithm function introduces ambiguities related to branch cuts and periodicity. Different initial conditions \\\\( z(0) \\\\) transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) can lead to the same set of values for \\\\( w(t) \\\\), especially due to the periodic nature of the exponential function and the potential for overlapping trajectories.",
