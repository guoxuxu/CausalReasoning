  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants. We investigate how the application of an input signal function transformed by \\\\( g(t) = e^{dt} \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) impacts the output over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( e^{dt}x(t) \\\\) at the beginning, \\\\( e^{-dt}x(t) \\\\) as an intervention, or both), only by analyzing \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the multiple transformations which can affect the system in nontrivial ways - particularly with modifying the signal in opposite manners (exponential growth and decay) - it’s nearly impossible to infer exactly which transformations were applied based only on the output at time T. This complexity is due to the non-uniqueness of solutions in exponential transformations impacting a dynamic system described by a transfer function.",
