  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator on function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\). To analyze the system's behavior, we explore the effect of applying Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), particularly focusing on the transformation over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, T)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied at the beginning or at a later time?",
  "Explanation": "If the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) leads to a well-posed PDE and the Fourier transform properties are preserved, inverse Fourier transform applied to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, T)\\\\) will uniquely determine the initial condition by reversing the time evolution in the transform space and applying the inverse transform, regardless of the transformation timing.",
