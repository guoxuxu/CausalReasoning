  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The effect of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\), is applied to analyze the frequency components of z(t).\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the function z(t) at its initial condition z(0), will the transformed signal \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) accurately reflect the original frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of z(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(0) \\\\), the Fourier Transform directly captures the frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The transformation is suited to extract this frequency, resulting in a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the frequency domain.",
