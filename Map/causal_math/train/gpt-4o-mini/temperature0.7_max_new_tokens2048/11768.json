  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. The function is initially transformed by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t} u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then the system evolves solely under the influence of the heat equation, will the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T differ from that of a system that evolves without the initial transformation by \\\\( f(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t} u \\\\) affects the propagation of temperature in the medium. Since \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) is a time-dependent factor, it multiplies the initial condition by a growing or decaying exponential (depending on the sign of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)), which modifies the rate and manner in which heat diffuses across the medium, leading to a different thermal distribution at any subsequent time T.",
