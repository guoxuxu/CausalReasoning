  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a closed container, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity constant. We investigate the effect of a spatial transformation \\\\( u' = T(u) \\\\) where \\\\( T \\\\) is a rotation matrix.\n\nCan we uniquely retrieve the original velocity field \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 after observing the velocity field \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the rotational nature of matrix \\\\( T \\\\), it might have altered the initial conditions in a way that is fundamentally indistinguishable from a naturally evolved field at a later time, particularly when only observing the result without knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( T \\\\).",
