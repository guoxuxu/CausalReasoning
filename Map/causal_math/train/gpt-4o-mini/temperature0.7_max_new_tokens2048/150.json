  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a system defined by complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. The system transformation is examined by applying the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another complex constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the system at time T, can we deduce the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) might have altered the initial conditions and, depending on the properties of N relative to M, the transformation may not be reversible.",
