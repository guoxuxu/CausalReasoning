  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t. Analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the function.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where b is a different complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original function and not on a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another transformation based on b, which affects the behavior from t_1 onward. Consequently, the resulting state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the original evolution up to t_1 under \\\\( g(z) \\\\)'s influence and the subsequent evolution under \\\\( h(z) \\\\), influenced by both a and b.",
