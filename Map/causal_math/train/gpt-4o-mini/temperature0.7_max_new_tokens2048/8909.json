  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then allowed to resolve under the given differential equation without intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(f)(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be identical to directly transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) evolved to time \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the evolved system incorporates changes due to the differential equation's influence, shifting frequencies in the transformation. Due to the nature of the differential equation, which influences growth terms involving \\\\( iz \\\\), the transform of the function evolved over time differs from the original transformation.",
