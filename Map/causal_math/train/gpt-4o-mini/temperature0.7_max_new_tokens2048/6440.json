  "Problem": "Consider a system where a temperature field T is modeled by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplace operator. We investigate the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + h(x,t) \\\\), with \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) being a heat source function varying in space and time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\), \\\\( g(T) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( T(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different sequences or types of interventions, due to the variable nature and overlapping effects of additional heat \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and cooling \\\\( k(x,t) \\\\) functions. These additive and subtractive transformations complicate exact backward determination of interventions.",
