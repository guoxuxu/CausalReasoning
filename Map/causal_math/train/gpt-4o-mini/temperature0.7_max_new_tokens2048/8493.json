  "Problem": "Analyze a system where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(y)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} y(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), giving a transformed function in the frequency domain. Consider effects of an inverse transformation and external modulation by a function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) applied at a specific time.\n\nIf a signal \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes Fourier Transformation and is left to propagate without further intervention, will the inverse Fourier Transform recover the original signal exactly at time \\\\(T\\\\), assuming no loss of information in transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier Transform will theoretically recover the original signal perfectly, assuming the transform and its inverse are correctly applied and integral calculations are exact, despite temporal shifts.",
