  "Problem": "Analyze a feedback system involving the complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - cz} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to the initial input \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and is continuously re-applied to its own output in a feedback loop. Additionally, explore how the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) influences the system over time.\n\nIf the initial input is \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the feedback loop is allowed to run without any external interruption, will the system reach a stable state as \\\\( t \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\) assuming |c|<1?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the iterative application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) leads to a geometric series convergence as \\\\( t \\\\) tends to infinity if |c|<1. As each iteration depends linearly on the previous output through the complex function, the mapping inside the unit circle ensures convergence to a stable point, which is the fixed point of the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
