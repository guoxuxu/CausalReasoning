  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the complex plane and a Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We explore the implications of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( g(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant, and analyzing the resultant transformations and effects.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace Transform to \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and then evolve \\\\( F(s) \\\\) over a variable \\\\( s \\\\), will it still represent the Laplace Transform of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) as \\\\( s \\\\) changes?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) is \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\) for Re(s) > 0. Evolving \\\\( s \\\\) just changes the parameter of the same transform function, thus \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will always represent the transform of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) under different values of \\\\( s \\\\), provided Re(s) remains positive.",
