  "Problem": "We analyze a heat equation \\(\\partial u/\\partial t = \\alpha \\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2\\) for a rod initially subject to a temperature distribution \\(u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) with \\(\\alpha > 0\\). Let's evaluate the effects of applying a Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine component.\n\nIf the Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) is applied at some middle time \\(t_1\\), will the temperature profile \\(u(x, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) be influenced by this transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) at \\(t_1\\) alters the temperature profile at that instant, which influences how it evolves subsequently under the heat equation. This intervention changes the state of the system, influencing the outcome at \\(T\\).",
