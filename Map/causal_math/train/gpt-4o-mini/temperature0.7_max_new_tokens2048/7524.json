  "Problem": "Consider a controlled heat equation on a metal rod along the x-axis modeled by \\\\(\\\\partial_t u(t, x) = k \\\\partial_{xx} u(t, x) + f(t, x)\\\\), where u represents the temperature at position x and time t, k is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(f(t, x)\\\\) is a heating function that varies with time and position.\n\nBased on the temperature profile at time T, \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\), can we decipher if the subsequent intervention \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) was applied, and whether it entirely replaced the initial heat source \\\\( f(t, x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature profile at time T, \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\), does not necessarily reveal whether \\\\( f(t, x) \\\\) was replaced or supplemented by \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\). Both sources could contribute to the resultant heat profile, and isolating the effects without additional information is challenging.",
