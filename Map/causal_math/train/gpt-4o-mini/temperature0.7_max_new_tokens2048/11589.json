  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{tt} = -\\Delta u + \\lambda u \\\\), where \\\\( \\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a scalar parameter. We explore the effect of an initial condition manipulation described by \\\\( u(0,x) = \\phi(x) \\\\) and an impulse transformation \\\\( u_t(0,x) = \\psi(x) \\\\), where \\\\(\\phi(x)\\\\) and \\\\(\\psi(x)\\\\) are specific functions.\n\nIf \\\\( u(0,x) = \\phi(x) \\\\) and \\\\( u_t(0,x) = \\psi(x) \\\\) are set as initial conditions without further external influences, will the state \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) for T > 0 be solely determined by \\\\(\\phi(x)\\\\) and \\\\(\\psi(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's future states depend entirely on its initial conditions and independent parameters under the governing differential equation. Given \\\\(\\phi(x)\\\\) and \\\\(\\psi(x)\\\\), the solution \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\) at any time T can be uniquely determined from the wave equation's solution formulation with these initial conditions.",
