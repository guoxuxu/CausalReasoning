  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(s-t)A}h(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent function. The transformation \\\\(g(z) = Cz + D\\\\int_0^T z(s) ds\\\\) is applied at time T, where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nGiven \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we unequivocally reconstruct all previous \\\\(h(t)\\\\) for t in [0, T) without knowing whether an intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The integration and matrix exponential involved in defining \\\\(z(t)\\\\) blur the specific effects of earlier values of \\\\(h(t)\\\\), and without knowing the details of any transformation like \\\\(g(z)\\\\), recovering \\\\(h(t)\\\\) precisely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is not generally possible.",
