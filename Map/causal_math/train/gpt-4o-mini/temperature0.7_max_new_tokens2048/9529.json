  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\theta(t)}\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant radial distance and \\\\(\\\\theta(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent angle. We explore the transformation under the matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) & \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) representing a rotation by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the function without further intervention, will the result at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( M(t) \\\\) changes the initial phase of the function, effectively spinning it by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\). Hence, the angle \\\\(\\\\theta(T)\\\\) becomes \\\\(\\\\theta(0) + \\\\omega T\\\\), which is not equal to \\\\(\\\\theta(T)\\\\) if directly evolved.",
