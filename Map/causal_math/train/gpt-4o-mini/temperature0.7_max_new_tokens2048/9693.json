  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The scenario evaluates the impact of modifying this function through an integral transform, specifically a Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) valid for \\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and transformed back without any modifications, will the resultant function over time \\\\( t \\\\) be exactly the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are designed to reconstruct the original function if there are no alterations during the process. Hence, assuming no intervention and proper conditions (\\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\) being maintained), the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be exactly retrieved.",
