  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) is considered for modeling the effect of time-dependent rotations on this system.\n\nCan we determine the precise original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature and inherent characteristics of the governing equation and transformation, reverse-engineering to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is possible. The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), being a simple rotation, preserves the magnitudes and can be mathematically inverted and factored out to recover the initial condition.",
