  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a vector space given by the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) which projects vectors onto a subspace. We explore the effects of applying another linear transformation \\\\( Q \\\\), which is a rotation matrix, on this vector space.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by applying a scaling matrix \\\\( S \\\\) (where S is a constant diagonal matrix) is introduced, will the final state at T > t_1 be independent of the sequence in which \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) were initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with scaling modifies the scenario such that the final vector \\\\( v(T) \\\\) will still depend on whether \\\\( P \\\\) or \\\\( Q \\\\) was applied first. The scaling transformation amplifies the components differently based on the basis set by the initial operations, and the prior sequence of projection and rotation influences the scaling effect.",
