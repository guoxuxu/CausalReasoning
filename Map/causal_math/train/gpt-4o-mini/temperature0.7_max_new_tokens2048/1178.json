  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving via the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Qz \\\\), with Q being a complex constant. Analysis includes the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\), where P is also a complex constant, representing an operational transformation.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) before any transformations without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to reverse the evolution accurately as the transformation \\\\( e^{Pt} \\\\) could alter both magnitude and phase in ways that are not distinguishable from the effects of Q alone at T.",
