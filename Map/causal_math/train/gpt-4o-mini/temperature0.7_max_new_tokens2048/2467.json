  "Problem": "Consider a periodic signal described by the function \\\\( v(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi) \\\\). The signal undergoes various modifications using a linear operator represented by \\\\( L \\\\) that performs a convolution with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specifically designed to alter phase and amplitude.\n\nIf an additional linear operation \\\\( M \\\\) with another kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied at a later time t = t_1, does the signal \\\\( u(t) = M[w(t)] \\\\) at t = T depend only on the operation \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervened signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time T depends both on the earlier applied \\\\( L \\\\) as well as the later applied \\\\( M \\\\). The effects of the kernels \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are both influential, affecting the resultant signal through combined interactions.",
