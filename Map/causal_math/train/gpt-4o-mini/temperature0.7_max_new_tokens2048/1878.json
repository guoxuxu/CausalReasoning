  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in an electric field described by a vector function \\\\(E(x, t)\\\\). The velocity of the particle \\\\(v(t)\\\\) at time t is affected by this field through the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = qE(x(t), t)\\\\), where q is the charge of the particle and x(t) its position. We investigate the impact of the function \\\\(g(x, v, t) = e^{At}v + \\int_0^t K(t, s) x(s) ds\\\\), with A being a constant matrix and K(t, s) an integral kernel function.\n\nIs it possible to deduce the initial velocity \\\\(v_0\\\\) after observing the velocity \\\\(v(T)\\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\(g(x, v, t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\(g(x, v, t)\\\\) affected the initial conditions, the added dynamics from the matrix exponential and the integral transformation obscure the original state, making it impossible to trace back uniquely.",
