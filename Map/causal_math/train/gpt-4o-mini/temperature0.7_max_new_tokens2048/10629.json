  "Problem": "We are investigating the temperature dynamics in a material described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Consider the effect of a thermal control method described by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling \\\\( u_0 \\\\). This scaling alters the response of the system to the heat equation, causing a difference in the temperature distribution at any time T due to exponential growth factors introduced by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\).",
