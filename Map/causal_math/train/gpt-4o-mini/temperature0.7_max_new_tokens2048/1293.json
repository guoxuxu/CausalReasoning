  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\( F[u(x)] \\) is computed and used to evolve the function u(x) under the operator L, without further intervention, will the resulting function \\( v(t) \\) remain unchanged at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution under the operator L, which corresponds to a second derivative, fundamentally alters the frequency spectrum of u(x). The Fourier transform changes how u(x) manifests in the frequency domain, and operating on this transformed function with L will likely lead to changes in the function's structure by t = T.",
