  "Problem": "Consider the diffusion equation for heat transfer in a rod, \\\\( \\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = k \\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial x^2 \\\\), where u is the temperature, x is the spatial variable, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effect of an initial function \\\\( u(x,0) = e^{ax} \\\\), where a is also a constant.\n\nCan the initial parameter a be uniquely determined after observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t, without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusion process, described by \\\\( \\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = k \\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial x^2 \\\\), generally smooths out the initial conditions over time, making it challenging to precisely back-calculate the exact value of a only from later state information without additional initial or boundary condition data.",
