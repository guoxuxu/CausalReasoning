  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) being a function evolving under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. Consider the role of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and how it interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we conclusively trace back to the exact initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) when considering the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) encodes frequency content from the entire time evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), but it does not preserve detailed phase or initial state information in a unique manner due to potential overlaps in the frequency domain representations of different initial states.",
