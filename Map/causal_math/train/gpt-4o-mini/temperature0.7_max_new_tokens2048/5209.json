  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Analyze the changes induced by performing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function, leading to the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and allowed to remain unaffected further, will the result \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) retain information about the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function at \\\\( \\omega' = \\omega \\\\), thus preserving information about the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). It directly links the cause (original function) to the effect (Fourier transform), clearly reflecting the original system’s characteristics.",
