  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. The change of this function over time is given by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nCan the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to reliably backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) might have been applied, altering the initial conditions in ways that are not easily reversible or discernible from the final conditions alone, especially if \\\\( D \\\\) does not commute with \\\\( C \\\\).",
