  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system under a specific transformation, where \\( z(t) \\) represents a complex function of time \\( t \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), with \\( \\omega \\) constant. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is utilized to study the system's frequency domain characteristics.\n\nFrom the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\), can we uniquely determine both the frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) of the original system \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides the frequency \\( \\omega \\) through the location of the pole; however, the magnitude and phase of \\( z_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) alone without additional initial condition data.",
