  "Problem": "Consider a model for the propagation of a signal \\\\(s(t)\\\\) through a medium, where the signal is initially transformed by a function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kx} \\\\), and the medium's response is modeled by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. The propagation is analyzed at various times t under different transformations.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial signal form \\\\( s(0) \\\\) without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information about whether the initial transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied makes it impossible to retroactively determine \\\\( s(0) \\\\) with certainty, as the transformation could have modified the signal in a way that is indistinguishable at later times given the linear dynamics.",
