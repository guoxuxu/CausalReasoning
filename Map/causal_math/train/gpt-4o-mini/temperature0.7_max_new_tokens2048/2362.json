  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a time-dependent state in a system. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has undergone the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) without other specific knowledge about the transformation parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation through \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) involves integral accumulations that inherently modify and obscure the original state characteristics. Without knowing the effects of these transformations over time, specifically the values \\(\\omega\\), retracing to the initial conditions accurately is impossible.",
