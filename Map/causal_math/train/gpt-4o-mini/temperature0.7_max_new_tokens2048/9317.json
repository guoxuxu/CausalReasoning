  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nIf \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is applied to a solution vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) that satisfies \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) and then \\\\(x\\\\) is allowed to evolve under the equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at any t be a solution to \\\\(Ax = b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Application of \\\\(f(x)\\\\) results in \\\\(Mx_0\\\\), and since M is invertible and \\\\(Ax_0 = b\\\\), multiplying by M does not alter the fact that \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) is still valid due to the properties of matrix equations, meaning the transformed vector remains a solution.",
