  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to a complex number \\\\( z_0 = u_0 + iv_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\) without further intervention, where c is a real constant, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially rotates the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), altering its arguments by adding a phase shift of \\\\( i\\\\omega t \\\\). This change in the initial condition leads to a different trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it evolves, resulting in a state at time T that differs from the one it would have reached without the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
