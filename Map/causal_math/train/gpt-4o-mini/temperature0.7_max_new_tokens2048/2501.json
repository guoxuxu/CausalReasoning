  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) \\) defined on the complex plane where \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z^t \\, dt \\), and \\( s \\) is a fixed complex number. The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z \\).\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then \\( f(z) \\) is computed without further intervention, does \\( f(g(z_0)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) equal \\( f(z_0) \\) computed directly at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) alters the input to \\( f(z) \\), and because the integral transformation in \\( f(z) \\) depends non-linearly on its input due to the exponentiation \\( z^t \\), the output \\( f(g(z_0)) \\) will generally not equal \\( f(z_0) \\). The nature of both transformations involves complex exponentials, making their combined effect not straightforward.",
