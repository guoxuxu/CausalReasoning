  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)](k) \\\\) on the function u(x, t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to if the Fourier transform was applied directly to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution of the evolution equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) at any time T will be the same as applying the Fourier transform initially and then allowing it to evolve. This results from the linearity and the time-invariance properties of the Fourier transform in conjunction with the linear operator L.",
