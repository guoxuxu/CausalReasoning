  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\) as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the system continues to evolve under the diffusion PDE, will the population distribution at a later time \\\\( t_2 > t_1 \\\\) be solely determined by the initial diffusion process?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with Fourier transform alters the state of \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\), potentially adding new frequency components or redistributing existing ones. Thus, the population distribution at any later \\\\( t_2 \\\\) is a result of both the initial diffusion process and the changes introduced by the Fourier transform.",
