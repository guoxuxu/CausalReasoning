  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) which is a complex exponential representing oscillatory behavior with a constant \\\\( C \\\\) and angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\). An operator \\\\( T \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as follows: \\\\( Tz(t) = z(t + h) \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a time-shift constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the operator \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\), the unknown shift (or lack thereof) creates ambiguity in determining the original state, as the phase shift introduced by \\\\( T \\\\) cannot be distinguished from natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
