  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is analytically mapped using a Mobius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, d \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\), at t = T, match the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Mobius transformation changes the initial conditions by potentially moving the position of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane. Since \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) rotates about the origin, the trajectory will differ unless \\\\( f \\\\) specifically maps \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to itself, which generally isn't the case.",
