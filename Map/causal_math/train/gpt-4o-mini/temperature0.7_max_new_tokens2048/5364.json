  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential overlap in the effects of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\) and their non-commutative properties with respect to time evolution, multiple transformation scenarios may lead to the same final state. This ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely identify which transformations were applied.",
