  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\( T \\) defined by \\( T[u](x, t) = \\int K(x, y, t) u(y, t) dy \\), where \\( K \\) is a kernel function.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( u(x, 0) \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( u(x, T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( T[u] \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\( T[u] \\) was applied, the changes imposed by the kernel function \\( K \\) might have shifted the initial conditions in a non-reversible way, especially if \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) do not have properties that allow easy inversion or deconvolution.",
