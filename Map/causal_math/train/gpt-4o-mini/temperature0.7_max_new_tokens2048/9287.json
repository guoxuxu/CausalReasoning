  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different function \\\\( j(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the function value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( j(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) further introduces a new modifying factor, meaning the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). The compounding effects of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) through their exponential contributions change both phase and magnitude, altering the trajectory and endpoint.",
