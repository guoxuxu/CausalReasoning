  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze this function's impact when applied as a transformation within an integral, specifically for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf an intervention changes the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) to now compute \\\\( \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{az} \\\\, dz + \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{b e^z} \\\\, dz \\\\), does this outcome solely depend on the new parameter \\\\( b \\\\) and not on the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters part of the integral to depend heavily both on the value of \\\\( b \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\). Both factors significantly influence the result, altering it from what would be calculated without either the change in parameter or the transformation.",
