  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with M being a linear operator. An external force applies a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + k\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where k and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, acting on the state vector \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing it underwent transformations by both \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(j(z)\\\\), can we determine which function was applied first or the values of k and d?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be influenced by the sequence of applications and their respective parameters in a non-trivial way, making it impossible to analytically deduce the order or the exact values of k and d from the final state alone, particularly due to possible phase cancellations and the superposition principle.",
