  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be a result of multiple combinations of rotational interventions due to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) and the inherent properties of complex number rotation. The impact of these rotations can overlap, thus making it impossible to uniquely identify from the endpoint alone which transformations were applied.",
