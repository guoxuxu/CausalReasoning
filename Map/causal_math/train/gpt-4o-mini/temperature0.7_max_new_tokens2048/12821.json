  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t).\n\nIf the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given at t = T, can we precisely reconstruct \\\\( z(0) \\\\), the original state at t = 0, assuming no knowledge of whether a transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform does not necessarily enable precise backward calculation to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without specific knowledge of the frequency content throughout the entire duration up to T, and especially without confirming the non-intervention of other transformations. There's an inherent loss of phase and potential mix in frequencies that obscures direct reconstruction.",
