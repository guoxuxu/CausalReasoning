  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t))(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the original time domain function. Investigate the effect of inverse Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s))(t) \\\\) and the influence of multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\) in the s-domain on this relationship.\n\nIf \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is multiplied by \\\\( s \\\\) in the s-domain and then we apply the inverse Laplace transform, does the resulting \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and not on the multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\) in the s-domain corresponds to the differentiation of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the time domain. Therefore, the output of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(sY(s))(t) \\\\) is \\\\( y'(t) \\\\), which is a fundamentally different function from the original \\\\( y(t) \\\\), showing a dependence on the form of intervention.",
