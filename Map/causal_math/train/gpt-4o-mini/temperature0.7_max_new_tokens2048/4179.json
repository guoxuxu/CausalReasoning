  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation studied involves the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf a perturbing functional transformation \\\\( P(z) = z + \\\\delta e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) are constants) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), how does this affect the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at times \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) when compared to the untouched system?",
  "Explanation": "The perturbation \\\\( P(z) \\\\) introduces an additive adjustment that persists over time because of the exponential nature of \\\\( \\\\dot{z} \\\\), thereby altering the subsequent trajectory from what would have resulted without any intervention.",
