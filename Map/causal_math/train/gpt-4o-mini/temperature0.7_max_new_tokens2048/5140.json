  "Problem": "Let's analyze a discrete system defined using the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of a matrix A. Consider a complex function, \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - \\\\lambda_i} \\\\), applied to each eigenvalue and its effects on solving the integral, \\\\( \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{f(z)}{z - \\\\lambda_i} dz \\\\) where C is a contour encompassing all eigenvalues.\n\nGiven results from the integral transformation at time t > t2 where an intervention with matrix S occurred, can we determine whether the original or modified system governed the effect without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "With results obtained post-intervention, you cannot conclusively distinguish if the integral's output derived from the original eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) or their modified form \\\\( S\\\\lambda_iS^{-1} \\\\) without explicit knowledge of the intervention's specifics. Ambiguity arises due to the integral reflecting the current system's state, irrespective of its genesis.",
