  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the displacement vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time t is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by the function \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), on the system behavior.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the Fourier transform \\\\( F(x(T)) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform obscures direct time-domain information such as initial states due to its integral over all times, making it impossible to precisely deduce \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without specific knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( F(x) \\\\).",
