  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The intervention is introduced by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied at a specific time.\n\nIs it possible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the transformed initial conditions imposed by C are unknown, causing uncertainty in retracing to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Mixed evolutions driven by matrices M and N, and the unknown initial impact of C, make it problematic to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
