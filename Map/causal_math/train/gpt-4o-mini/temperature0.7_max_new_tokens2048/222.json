  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(t, y(t)) = \\\\int_0^T k(t, s) y(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a function of time evolved from initial conditions under some autonomous differential equation. We test causal reasoning about the impact of modifying the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\).\n\nCan the original kernel function \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) be uniquely determined at time t = 0 after observing the transformed output \\\\( g(T, y(T)) \\\\) at t = T without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and the specific form of the integral transformation, multiple different kernel functions could potentially yield the same transformation output at t = T, resulting in an inability to uniquely identify \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\).",
