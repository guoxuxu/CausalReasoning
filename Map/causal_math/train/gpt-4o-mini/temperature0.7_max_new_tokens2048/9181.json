  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\), where A is a 2x2 constant matrix. Observe the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Px\\\\), where P is a constant invertible 2x2 matrix, and its effects on the solutions.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(x) = Px\\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) and the system evolves as per \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t = T be identical to the evolution starting from the vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) under the same system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(x)\\\\) changes the initial state from \\\\(x_0\\\\) to \\\\(Px_0\\\\). The evolution process dictated by \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\) will then follow a trajectory from this new initial condition, leading to different results at time T unless P commutes with the exponential of A.",
