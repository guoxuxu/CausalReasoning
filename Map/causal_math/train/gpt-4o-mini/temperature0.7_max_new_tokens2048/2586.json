  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the function transforms under the operation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(s) ds \\\\), which is integrated over the time interval from 0 to T.\n\nGiven a computed value for \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we reliably determine the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) specifically as \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) from 0 to T without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could potentially correspond to different functions that satisfy the boundary conditions and are not limited to the form \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Additional properties of the function prior to integration are necessary to uniquely identify the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
