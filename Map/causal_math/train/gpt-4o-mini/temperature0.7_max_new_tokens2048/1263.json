  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t}\\\\) at some time t midpoint, where \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\neq \\\\omega\\\\), will the spectrum \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) still show a delta function only at the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) midway creates a scenario where the signal comprises two different frequencies. The resulting Fourier transform will reflect this, showing delta functions at both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\), not merely at the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
