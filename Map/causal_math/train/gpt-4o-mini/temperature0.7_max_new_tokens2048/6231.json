  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal x(t) is subjected to a linear transformation using an operator L. The transformed signal is represented as y(t) = L{x(t)}. Further, an integral transform T defined by T{y(t)} = ∫y(t)e^{-st} dt is applied to y(t).\n\nIf an additional operator M is applied to y(t) before the transform T, i.e., z(t) = M{y(t)} and then T{z(t)} is computed, does the final result depend solely on the properties of L?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of operator M introduces another level of transformation to y(t), making the final output of T depend on both L and M. The transformations done by L and M can have interdependent or compound effects that shape the outcome.",
