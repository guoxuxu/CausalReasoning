  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function is subject to transformations using Fourier transforms over time.\n\nGiven the final transformed signal at T, can we decisively determine whether the intervention of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) occurred if both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) have similar frequency components?",
  "Explanation": "If the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) overlap significantly or are indistinguishable due to their similar values, it is challenging to discern conclusively whether an intervention occurred by analyzing the frequency domain data alone. The transformation results might suggest the presence of similar frequencies arising from either one condition or their combination.",
