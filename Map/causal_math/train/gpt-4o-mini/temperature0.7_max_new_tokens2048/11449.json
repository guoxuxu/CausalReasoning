  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We're interested in observing the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system evolves according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) differ from what it would be if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had evolved freely according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the original dynamics by introducing a scale factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), changing the amplitude and possibly the phase depending on the real and imaginary components of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). Thus, the state at any time T will not only be affected by the angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also by the scaling and rotation introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
