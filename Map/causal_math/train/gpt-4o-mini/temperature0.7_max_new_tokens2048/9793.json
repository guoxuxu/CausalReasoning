  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\(dz = Pz \\, dt\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. Investigate the implications of applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\) over time \\(t\\), with \\(Q\\) also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to evolve under \\( dz = Pz \\, dt \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be equivalent to if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( dz = Pz \\, dt \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( g(z) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) modifies the initial state \\( z_0 \\) to \\( e^{Q0}z_0 = z_0 \\). However, the trajectory from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\) is influenced by \\( e^{Qt} \\) under \\( dz = Pz \\, dt \\), depending on the relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), leading to a different state than the untransformed evolution at \\( t = T \\).",
