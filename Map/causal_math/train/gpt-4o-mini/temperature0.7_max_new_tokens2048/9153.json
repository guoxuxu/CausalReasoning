  "Problem": "In a control system, the effect of a matrix operator \\\\( P \\\\) on a signal's Fourier transform is examined. Given a signal function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), its Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is denoted by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The operator \\\\( P \\\\) acts on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) to produce \\\\( P(X(\\\\omega)) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\omega^2}X(\\\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( P \\\\) is applied to \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and the transformed signal is then processed through a system characterized by \\\\( G(s) = s + \\\\omega^2 \\\\) without further intervention, will the output at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) was processed directly through \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( P \\\\) first and then \\\\( G(s) \\\\) effectively cancels out the transformation introduced by \\\\( P \\\\) since \\\\( G(s)P(X(\\\\omega)) = (s + \\\\omega^2)\\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\omega^2}X(\\\\omega) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\). Hence, the output is the same as if the signal had been processed through \\\\( G(s) \\\\) directly.",
