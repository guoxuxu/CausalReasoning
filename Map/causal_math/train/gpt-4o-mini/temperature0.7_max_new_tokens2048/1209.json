  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). To further analyze or manipulate the signal, an operator \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied in the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is generated from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via Fourier Transform and then immediately subjected to the transformation by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the resulting signal's inverse Fourier Transform \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was first modified by an inverse transformation corresponding to \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) directly in the frequency domain post-Fourier Transform generally yields different results compared to modifying \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with a corresponding inverse operation first, due to differences in how operations affect signals in time versus frequency domains.",
