  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) (where \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency) applied to a signal transformation described by the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{s(t)\\\\} = S(\\\\omega) \\\\). We examine the impact of modifying the frequency component by multiplying the original signal by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the transformed signal is Fourier transformed without further intervention, will the Fourier transform result \\\\( S'(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the same as the original \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) causes a frequency shift in the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\). The Fourier transform of the modified signal \\\\( s'(t) = s(t)e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) will be \\\\( S'(\\\\omega) = S(\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0) \\\\), indicating a shift, hence the transformed signal's spectrum is not the same but shifted.",
