  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation function \\\\( k(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is used as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) adds a shift to the complex number which compounds with the initial transformation effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). This makes the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the earlier squared state plus the subsequent shift, reflecting the impacts of both transformations.",
