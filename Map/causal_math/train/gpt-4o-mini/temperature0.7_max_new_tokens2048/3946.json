  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which maps time t onto the unit circle in the complex plane. Assuming we apply a transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), we investigate the effects and causal inferences from applying this transformation versus the natural evolution of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( z(T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the observed \\( z(T) \\) can be reached either by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) naturally or by squaring an initially transformed state, it's impossible to deduce if \\( z_0 \\) was \\( e^{i0} \\) or \\( (e^{i0})^2 \\) without additional information about whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied.",
