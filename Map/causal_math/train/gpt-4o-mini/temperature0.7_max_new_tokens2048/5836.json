  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We analyze the potential effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where S is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the function at time \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\) or both), strictly from knowing the function at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of multiple complex integrations and the non-commutative properties of matrix exponentials make it infeasible to pinpoint which transformation(s) were applied without additional information. The same end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations or applications of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves over time to produce z(T) through the influence of the constant matrix M. The integral transformation h(z) depends on z(t) and results in h(z), which in turn influences z(T). The transformation k(z) also depends on z(t) and similarly affects z(T). Additionally, the constant matrix S influences the integral transformation h(z).",
