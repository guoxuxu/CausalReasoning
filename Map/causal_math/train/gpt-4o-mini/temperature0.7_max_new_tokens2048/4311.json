  "Problem": "Let's examine a continuity equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (vu) = 0\\\\), where v is a fixed velocity field. Consider the Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)(k)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx}u(x) dx\\\\) applied to the function u. We explore how this transformation affects the evolution of u over time.\n\nIf an intervention in terms of augmenting a scalar multiple a(v, t, x) to the velocity field v is introduced at a random time t = t_0, will the final state u(T) of the system be invariant under the initial Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a(v, t, x) alters the characteristics of the velocity field thereby affecting the evolution path of u. This intervention changes the evolution even in the Fourier transformed domain because the scalar a(v, t, x) affects how the continuity equation dictates the distribution and amplitude of u in both the original and Fourier domains.",
