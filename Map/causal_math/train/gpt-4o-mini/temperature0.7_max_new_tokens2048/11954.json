  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( g(z) \\) defined on the complex plane as \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number. The function is studied under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) which transforms \\( g(t) \\) from the time domain to the complex \\( s \\)-domain.\n\nIf a modification \\( h(z) = e^{dz} \\) where \\( d \\) is another complex constant, is applied to \\( g(t) \\) before transformation, will the resulting function \\( H(s) \\) depend only on \\( c \\) or both \\( c \\) and \\( d \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of applying \\( h(z) \\) modifies \\( g(t) \\) to \\( g(t)h(t) = e^{(c+d)t} \\). The Laplace Transform of the modified function is \\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(c+d)} \\), showing the transformed function depends on both \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), not just \\( c \\).",
