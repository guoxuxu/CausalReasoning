  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\\\) and its impact on a contour integral over a closed path in the complex plane. Analyze how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z + ai\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit) affects the evaluation of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) around a simple closed contour \\\\(C\\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to modify the contour \\\\(C\\\\) to \\\\(C'\\\\), and then the integral of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is computed around \\\\(C'\\\\), will the value of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_{C'} f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) be the same as the original \\\\(\\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) shifts the contour in the complex plane, which can lead to encompassing or excluding poles that were not originally encompassed or excluded in the initial contour \\\\(C\\\\). Since the residues at these poles contribute to the integral via the residue theorem, moving the contour affects the value of the integral.",
