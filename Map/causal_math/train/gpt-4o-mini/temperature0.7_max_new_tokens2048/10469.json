  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect over a region in the complex plane. Let \\\\( z \\\\) undergo a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) and analyze the transformation of the region under this function.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane, and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied without further intervention, will the result at point \\\\( z_1 = g(z_0) \\\\) be the same as applying \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will sequentially follow as \\\\( f(g(z_0)) = \\\\frac{1}{z_0^2} \\\\), which is indeed the result of first squaring \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then taking the reciprocal of the result, reflecting a direct transformation under these operations.",
