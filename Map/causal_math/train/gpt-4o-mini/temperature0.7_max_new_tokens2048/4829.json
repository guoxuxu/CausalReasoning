  "Problem": "Consider the discrete-time system defined by the equation \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Bx\\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(g(y)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(y_0\\\\) at n = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(y(n)\\\\) at n = N directly correspond to evolving \\\\(y_0\\\\) under \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\) till n = N?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(g(y) = By_0\\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the system. The subsequent evolution under the discrete system formula will then take this altered initial state forward, generating a trajectory different from that which would have occurred from \\\\(y_0\\\\) using only A.",
