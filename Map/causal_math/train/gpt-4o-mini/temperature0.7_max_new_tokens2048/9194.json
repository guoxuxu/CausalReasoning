  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ruled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + Bz^2 \\\\), where A and B are constants. We investigate the impacts of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and the nonlinear term \\\\( Bz^2 \\\\) complicate the trajectory. The ambiguity in the system's evolution precludes backward determination of the exact initial state.",
