  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) over time t, where J is a complex constant.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the system's modification by \\\\( e^{Jt} \\\\) obscures the initial state, making it hard to uniquely ascertain whether the observed state at time T is a result of the transformation or the evolution from a potentially different initial condition.",
