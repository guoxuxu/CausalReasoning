  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf, after initially computing \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), an intervention changes the function to be integrated to \\\\(g(z) = z + f(z)\\\\), will the result of the new integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C g(z) dz\\\\) still reflect the original integral without considering the effects of\\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the integrand to \\\\(g(z) = z + e^{z^2}\\\\) introduces additional complexities that distinctly affect the integral's value. Since the transformation incorporates terms involving \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\), it will not merely reflect the original simple pole structure around \\\\(z=a\\\\).",
