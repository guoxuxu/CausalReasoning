  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency of oscillation in radians per second. This defines a system where \\( z(t) \\) traces a circular path in the complex plane. Investigate the impact of a linear transformation \\( L(z) = Az + b \\) with complex constants A and b.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( M(z) = Cz + d \\) is applied as an intervention, where C and d are complex constants, will the resulting trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\) depend only on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( A \\), \\( b \\), \\( C \\), or \\( d \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\( M(z) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) adds another level of complexity, affecting both the scale and the position of the trajectory in the complex plane. The final trajectory will be influenced by the compositions of \\( A \\), \\( b \\), \\( C \\), and \\( d \\) along with the frequency \\( \\omega \\).",
