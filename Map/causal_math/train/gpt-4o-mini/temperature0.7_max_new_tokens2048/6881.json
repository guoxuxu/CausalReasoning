  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate changes in the function given by the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\), applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without any further modifications, does this transformation fundamentally change the function in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), which is a different representation in the complex frequency domain, altering its original time-domain behavior and properties.",
