  "Problem": "In a control system, the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant system represented by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = H(s)X(s) \\), where \\( H(s) \\) is the transfer function and \\( X(s) \\) is the input in the s-domain. Consider the effect of an additive control intervention \\( u(t) \\) on the system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( U(s) \\). The modified system output is \\( Y(s) = H(s)(X(s) + U(s)) \\).\n\nIf an intervention \\( U(s) \\) is applied at a time \\( t_1 \\), will the system output \\( Y(s) \\) be exclusively governed by \\( X(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\), independent of \\( U(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( U(s) \\) modifies the system's input, affecting the overall system's response. Consequently, the output \\( Y(s) \\) becomes a function of \\( X(s) + U(s) \\) shaped by \\( H(s) \\). Hence, the output depends on the intervention as well.",
