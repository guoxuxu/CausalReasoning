  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the wave equation in a one-dimensional domain, defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to the initial conditions.\n\nGiven only the Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we exactly reconstruct the original initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\), the specific way in which each frequency component evolves back to the original time cannot be determined accurately. Knowledge of \\\\( c \\\\) is essential to correctly backtrack each frequency component's evolution, which affects the ability to reconstruct the initial condition.",
