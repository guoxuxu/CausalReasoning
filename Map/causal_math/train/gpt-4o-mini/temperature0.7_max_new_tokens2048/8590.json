  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping complex numbers \\\\(z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) for a constant matrix A. This function is subjected to various transformations and the responses are observed over the path \\\\(z(t) = z_0 + vt\\\\) where \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant vector and \\\\(t\\\\) represents time.\n\nCan the initial complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) be uniquely determined from the final state \\\\(f(z(T))\\\\), assuming no external interventions and knowing A and T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific exponential and linear nature of the path and function, and knowing A and T, the evolution of the function can be uniquely traced back, allowing for the determination of \\\\(z_0\\\\) directly from \\\\(f(z(T))\\\\).",
