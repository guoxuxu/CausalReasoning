  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. A linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + \\\\alpha z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. We investigate how \\\\( L \\\\) affects the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention using a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) defined as \\\\( Mz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} - \\\\beta z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant, is applied, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using operator \\\\( M \\\\) contributes an additional alteration to the system by changing the frequency and amplitude characteristics through its differential operation. It not only affects the original trajectory but also introduces new dynamics combining with or contrary to the effects of operator \\\\( L \\\\).",
