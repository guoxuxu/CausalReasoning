  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform on the function, defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) after an unknown intervention, can we unequivocally identify if an impulse was added at a specific time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), just by analyzing \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier Transform contains all information about the time-domain function, identifying specific interventions like an impulse addition at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alone is complex due to complications such as phase and amplitude ambiguities. The identification isn't straightforward and depends heavily on the context or additional information.",
