  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistance R in series with an inductance L and a varying voltage source V(t). The voltage and current relationship is given by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI\\\\), where I is the current through the circuit.\n\nGiven the current I(T), can we determine precisely what interventions were made (whether resistance was added or changed, or the voltage was altered), only by knowing the value of I(T)?",
  "Explanation": "The current I(T) at time T can potentially result from various combinations of voltage levels and resistances due to the linear nature of the differential equation governing the circuit. Different voltage and resistance scenarios could yield the same current, making it impossible to uniquely identify the specific interventions based only on I(T).",
