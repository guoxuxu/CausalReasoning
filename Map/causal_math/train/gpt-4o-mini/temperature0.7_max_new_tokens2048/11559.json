  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega t} w \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The system under study is defined by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation on the system evolution.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\theta t}w \\\\) (where \\\\( \\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(w) \\\\) imposes an additional modulation, making the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\). The transformations \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\theta t} \\\\) can interact in complex ways, affecting the system's trajectory to an endpoint that depends on both constants.",
