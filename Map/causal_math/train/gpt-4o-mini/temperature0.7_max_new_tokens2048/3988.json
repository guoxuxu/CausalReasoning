  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(w) \\) mapping complex numbers where \\( z(w) \\) is defined as \\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega w} \\), with \\( \\omega \\) being a real constant. We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( Z(v) \\) on \\( z(w) \\), defined by \\( Z(v) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(w) e^{-ivw} dw \\).\n\nGiven \\( Z(v) \\) after applying the transformation \\( G(w) \\), can we deduce both the original \\( \\omega \\) and the phase shift \\( a \\) solely from \\( Z(v) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\( Z(v) \\) provides the magnitude and frequency information but does not independently reveal the phase shift \\( a \\). The phase shift alters the result in a way that may not be distinguishable solely through \\( Z(v) \\), necessitating additional information to fully reconstruct the original function parameters.",
