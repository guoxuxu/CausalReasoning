  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We study the implications of modifying this integral using a linear transformation of the variable x given by the function \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x \\\\) and then \\\\( F \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will \\\\( F(ax + b) \\\\) at x = T be the same as if \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was calculated directly at x = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\) changes the limits of integration in the function \\\\( F \\\\), which in turn affects the result of the integral. Since integration is sensitive to its variable's upper and lower bounds, the value of \\\\( F(ax + b) \\\\) will differ from \\\\( F(x) \\\\) at the same point due to the linear transformation.",
