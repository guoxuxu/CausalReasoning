  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor R and an inductor L in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(V(t)\\\\) denotes the applied voltage. We introduce a transformation \\\\(g(I) = I + ct\\\\), where c is a constant, applied to the current I at time t.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\(g(I)\\\\) to the current at t = 0, when \\\\(V(t) = V_0\\\\) a constant voltage, and allow the circuit to run without further intervention, will the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at time T differ from the untransformed system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(I)\\\\) modifies the initial current, altering the differential \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\) by adding the term ct to the current. This shifts the trajectory of the current solution, leading to a different current at any time T compared to the system where no transformation \\\\(g(I)\\\\) was applied.",
