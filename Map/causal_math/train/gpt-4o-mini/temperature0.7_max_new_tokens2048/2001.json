  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We investigate the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\( M \\), which acts on the complex plane by the function \\( f(z) = Mz \\).\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) and then the function \\( g(z) \\) is computed without further interventions, will the outcome at \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) be the same as computing \\( g(z_0) \\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the linear transformation \\( f(z) = Mz \\) modifies the argument of the exponential function in \\( g(z) \\). Since the matrix \\( M \\) can alter both magnitude and phase of \\( z_0 \\), \\( g(f(z_0)) = e^{iMz_0} \\) typically differs from \\( g(z_0) = e^{iz_0} \\), due to the changes in the complex exponential's frequency and growth rate.",
