  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function is subjected to a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) while keeping \\\\( y(t) \\\\) unchanged, will the resultant Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) depend solely on the original matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters \\\\( x(t) \\\\) selectively, thereby affecting the entire form of \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), and consequently the Fourier Transform. The changes induced by the scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) means that the resultant frequency behavior is not solely governed by A and B.",

The matrix A directly affects the behavior of x(t), while the matrix B directly influences y(t). The complex function z(t) is transformed into its Fourier representation, which depends on the original form of z(t). Applying a scaling factor alpha to x(t) modifies z(t), potentially affecting the Fourier Transform of z(t) at frequency omega.",
