  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, obeying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\). We study the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of transformations due to the scaling properties related to the exponential terms \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\lambda t} \\\\). The complex exponential growth impacts are not distinct enough to allow for definitive back tracking of the specific transformations used.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The change in the complex-valued function z(t) leads to its derivative dz/dt, which is influenced by the equation dz/dt = iz. The transformation g(z) modifies z(t) to yield an endpoint z(T), and the parameter k is a factor in the transformation g(z). The endpoint z(T) indicates what transformations were applied, including g(z) and potentially h(z).",
