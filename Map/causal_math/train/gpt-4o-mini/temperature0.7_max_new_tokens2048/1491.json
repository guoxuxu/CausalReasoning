  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The equation determines the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) as a function of time \\\\( t \\\\) on a unit circle in the complex plane. Analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another positive integer) is applied as an intervention at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant point \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) adds another complicating layer, making the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependant on \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( m \\\\), and \\\\( w \\\\). The new transformation changes the order of the exponential function further, altering the trajectory and endpoint, influenced by these multiples of the frequency \\\\( w \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "Time t influences the trajectory of z(t), which is determined by the parameter w. The transformation g(z) affects z by raising it to the power k, while the transformation h(z) raises z to the power m after time t1.
