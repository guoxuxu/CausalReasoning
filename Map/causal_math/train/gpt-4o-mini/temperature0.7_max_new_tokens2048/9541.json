  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) mapping from the complex numbers to complex numbers. Let's evaluate transformations induced by this function in the context of signal processing, particularly using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) = t \\\\), and apply \\\\( f \\\\) to the Laplace transformed function.\n\nIf we apply the function \\\\( f \\\\) to the outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) = t \\\\) without any other intervention, will the result, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f(g(t))](s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[t^2](s) = 2/s^3 \\\\), correspond to the square of the original Laplace transform result, \\\\( [\\\\mathcal{L}[t](s)]^2 = (1/s^2)^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f \\\\) directly to \\\\( g(t) = t \\\\) and then transforming produces \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[t^2](s) = 2/s^3 \\\\), which differs from squaring the original Laplace transform result, \\\\( (1/s^2)^2 = 1/s^4 \\\\). The non-linearity of \\\\( f \\\\) changes the transformation output.",
