  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the influence of applying a Fourier transform, where the transform is defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied in the form of a modification to the constant \\\\( k \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), converting it to another constant \\\\( k' \\\\), will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after this intervention depend solely on the new parameter \\\\( k' \\\\) and ignore the initial \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the system dynamics from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards, but the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will reflect both segments of the motion under \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( k' \\\\). Hence, \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) depends on both the history under \\\\( k \\\\) as well as the future evolution under \\\\( k' \\\\), reflecting contributions from both parameters.",
