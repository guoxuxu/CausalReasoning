  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a set of functions defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) represents a rotation by A in the complex plane over time t. Additionally, let there be a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another constant.\n\nGiven the observed result \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original starting point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without definitive knowledge about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is ambiguous whether the initial point was directly evolved under the rotational dynamics or altered by another rotation introduced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\). This difference crucially affects the tracing of the initial position \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
