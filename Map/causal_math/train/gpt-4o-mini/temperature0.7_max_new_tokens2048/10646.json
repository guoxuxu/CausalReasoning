  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function f(z) where f is an analytic function of the complex variable z. We're examining the effect of two transformations on f: multiplication by e^z, and application of the Fourier Transform denoted as F.\n\nAfter applying the transformation e^z to f(z), and subsequently observing the result from an arbitrary Fourier Transform F, can we uniquely ascertain f(z) from this outcome without further data?",
  "Explanation": "The operations involved, including multiplication by e^z and the Fourier Transform, significantly transform f(z). Given the general impact of these transformations and without additional constraints or data on the original function or the nature of e^z, retrieval of f(z) just from the output state is generally not feasible.",
