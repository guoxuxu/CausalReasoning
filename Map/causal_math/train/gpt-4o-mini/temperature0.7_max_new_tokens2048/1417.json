  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of an integral transformation on a function's Fourier transform. Suppose we have a function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) and we apply the transformation \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\). Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) as applied on both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( T(g)(x) \\\\).\n\nWill the Fourier transform of the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(g))(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equal to the Fourier transform of the original function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without any other transformations except for \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) fundamentally changes the function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), turning it from \\\\( \\\\sin(x) \\\\) to its integral, which alters both the function's domain and the behavior across the domain. Thus, their Fourier transforms will also differ, reflecting changes in the frequency domain representation.",
