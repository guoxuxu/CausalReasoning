  "Problem": "Let's consider the complex plane where the function is defined as \\( z \\mapsto w = e^z \\). Investigate how the transformation of this function affects the analytical structure of a complex domain, specifically whether causal inference about the original complex value (z) can be derived from its transformation (w) under various circumstances.\n\nDoes the transformation \\( w = e^z \\) on its own maintain the entire information of z such as determining z completely from w at any time \\( t \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential map \\( w = e^z \\) is not injective over the complex plane due to the periodicity of the exponential function in the imaginary direction. This means multiple different values of z can map to the same w, losing some information about the original z.",
