  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = a u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = b v \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants. We apply an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{kt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the transformed integral \\\\( T(z) \\\\) over a period [0, T], can we deduce the exact trajectories of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) throughout this period?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) aggregates the effect of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) over the whole interval into a single value, losing individual time-specific information about the trajectories. Thus, we cannot reconstruct exact trajectories of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) from the integral alone.",
