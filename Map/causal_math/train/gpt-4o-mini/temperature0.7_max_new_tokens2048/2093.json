  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0 \\\\), with p(t) and q(t) being continuous functions of time t. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transformation applied to y(t), specifically looking at the transformed function \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial conditions for y(t) at t = 0 are given, and the system evolves according to the differential equation without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) be sufficient to uniquely determine the state y(t) at any future time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of a linear differential equation uniquely encapsulates all information about the equation including its initial conditions when properly applied, it allows for the unique determination of y(t) for any t = T through the inverse transformation, assuming no additional changes in p(t) or q(t).",
