  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over the interval [0, T].\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be deduced uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), recovering the exact initial condition from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is confounded by the potential modifications induced by the integral transformation, which could affect both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) during [0, T].",
