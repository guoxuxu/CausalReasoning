  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing the amplitude and angular frequency respectively. For analysis, a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) is used, representing a Fourier transform component.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over time T, can we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Although \\\\( f(z) \\\\) provides information about the amplitude of the frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it does not provide phase or components at other frequencies. Thus, the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone without more information on other frequency components.",
