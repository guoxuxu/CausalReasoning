  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\\\), where X and Y are complex constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of applying Fourier transformation on this signal and then modifying its spectrum by a filter function \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed signal, can we unequivocally determine the original time-domain signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any modifications or additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the Fourier transformed signal strictly corresponds to knowing its spectrum. Since the Fourier transform is uniquely invertible under ideal conditions, the original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from its spectrum.",
