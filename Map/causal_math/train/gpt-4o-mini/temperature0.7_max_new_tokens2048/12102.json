  "Problem": "Investigate a complex dynamical system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by the input \\( x(t) \\) according to a Laplace transform relationship \\( Z(s) = X(s)/s \\). Here, \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Z(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( z(t) \\) respectively, with \\( s \\) being a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( x(t) \\) to \\( x(t) + \\sin(t) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the resultant \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the initial transform relationship?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters \\( x(t) \\), introducing a new component to the transform \\( X(s) \\), which now includes terms from the Laplace transform of \\( \\sin(t) \\) (i.e., \\( \\frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \\)). The output \\( z(T) \\) will thus consist of effects from both the original exponential input and the sinusoidal intervention.",
