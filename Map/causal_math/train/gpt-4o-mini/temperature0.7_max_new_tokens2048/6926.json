  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = c(t) + id(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven only the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we exactly recover the original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under reasonable conditions (e.g., \\\\( z(t) \\\\) being sufficiently smooth and decaying at infinity). Thus, knowing \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) allows recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier transform.",
