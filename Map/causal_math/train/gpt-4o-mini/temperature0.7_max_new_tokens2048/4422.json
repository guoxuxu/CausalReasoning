  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{C(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately trace back to the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be deduced accurately from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) because the transformation can significantly alter the trajectory in a way that is not reversible solely based on the endpoint data and without detailed information on the function \\\\( e^{C(t-s)} \\\\).",
