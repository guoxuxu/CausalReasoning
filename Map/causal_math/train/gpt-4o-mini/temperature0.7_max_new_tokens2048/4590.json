  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial states \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), the integral transformation could have changed the initial states. The transformation process, involving integration and matrix exponential, obscures the direct relation between initial and observed states.",
