  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the effect of two linear transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = az \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = bz \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are non-zero complex constants, on the mapping described by \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nGiven the output from \\\\( f \\\\) after applying two unknown transformations like \\\\( T_1 \\\\) and \\\\( T_2 \\\\), can we determine the sequence or types of these transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The output could be the same from different combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) since only the product \\\\( ab \\\\) comes into play, not the individual values or sequence of applications. This ambiguity in potential sequences and transformations given the same final output from \\\\( f \\\\) prevents unique identification of the interventions.",
