  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) \\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent control function.\n\nIf the control function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 to \\\\( u'(t) = Cu(t) \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a time T be the same as if the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the control function alters the input to the integral transformation, affecting the integrand \\\\( e^{A(t-s)}BC u(s) \\\\) due to the matrix C. Since the term \\\\( BC \\\\) does not generally equal B, this results in a different trajectory and hence a different final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
