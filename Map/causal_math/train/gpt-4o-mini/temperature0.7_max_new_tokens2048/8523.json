  "Problem": "Assume we are examining two parameterized functions, \\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\) and \\( g(w) = e^{\\lambda w} \\), where \\( c \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are complex numbers. We explore the effects of transformations involving these functions on the complex plane over parameter \\( t \\).\n\nIf during the evolution of \\( g(w) \\), we systematically modify \\( \\lambda \\) to \\( \\mu \\) at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), shifting \\( g(w) \\) to \\( e^{\\mu w} \\), will \\( g(w(T)) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) still depend solely on the original \\( \\lambda \\) without influence from \\( \\mu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the parameter from \\( \\lambda \\) to \\( \\mu \\) at \\( t_1 \\), altering the trajectory of \\( g(w) \\) from \\( e^{\\lambda w} \\) to \\( e^{\\mu w} \\). This change impacts \\( g(w(T)) \\), making it dependent on both \\( \\lambda \\) before \\( t_1 \\) and \\( \\mu \\) after \\( t_1 \\), reflecting in a compound exponential evolution influenced by the sequence of parameters.",
