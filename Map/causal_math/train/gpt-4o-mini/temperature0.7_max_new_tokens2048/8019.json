  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is also a constant matrix. The transformation occurs over time t concerning an initial state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where E is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) as an intervention alters the trajectory further depending on the relation between matrix exponentials \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\), and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be dependent on the interplay of these matrix exponentials and cannot rely solely on C.",
