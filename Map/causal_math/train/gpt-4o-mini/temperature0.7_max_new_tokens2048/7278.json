  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( u(x, T) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we deduce the original function \\( u(x, 0) \\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\( u(x, 0) \\). The Fourier transform could have fundamentally changed the initial conditions, which affects how the solution evolves according to \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\).",
