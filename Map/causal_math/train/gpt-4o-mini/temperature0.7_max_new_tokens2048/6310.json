  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by an integral transform \\\\( L[u(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation. Suppose we introduce a perturbation function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + p(x) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) solely from the transformed function \\\\( L[v(x)] \\\\), without knowledge of the perturbation function \\\\( p(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L[v(x)] = L[u(x)] + L[p(x)] \\\\) does not allow us to uniquely resolve \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( p(x) \\\\) or its transform, as the same result could arise from different combinations of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( p(x) \\\\).",
