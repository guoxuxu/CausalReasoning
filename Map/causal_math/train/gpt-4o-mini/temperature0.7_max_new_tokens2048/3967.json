  "Problem": "Consider the problem of heat distribution over a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion constant and u(x, t) represents the temperature. An integral transformation using the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the solution's behavior.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of an additional heat source described by another differential equation is applied at time t = t_1, will the Fourier-transformed solution at time T > t_1 solely depend on the original model parameters and initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "An intervention such as an additional heat source changes the system's state and, hence, the resulting solution's form. Both the original and the additional terms influence the Fourier-transformed solution, affecting the future distribution and evolution of heat on the rod.",
