  "Problem": "Consider the linear algebra system where vector transformation through matrices plays a key role. Let \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be the state of a system at any time t, evolving according to the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N(t)\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and \\\\(N(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent  force vector. Let there be an operation \\\\(h(z) = S t z\\\\), with S being a non-commutative constant matrix applied at a specified time.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time t, can we determine the initial vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the operation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), recovering the exact state \\\\(z_0\\\\) is not feasible. The modification by S and the presence of non-linearity due to N(t) introduce ambiguities that prevent backward calculation from \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
