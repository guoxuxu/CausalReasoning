  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) given by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z^t \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the implications of varying the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) in the function and its effect on the transformation of input complex number \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nGiven the value of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) for a fixed \\\\(z\\\\), can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) if |z| > 1?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\(g(z)\\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\(s\\\\) because different values of \\\\(s\\\\) can lead to similar magnitudes of decay in the integral, especially considering different potential phase rotations in \\\\(s\\\\) and complexities in evaluating integrals with complex exponentials.",
