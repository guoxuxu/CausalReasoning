  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( t \\) represents time. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation defined by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\nIf a modulation function \\( m(t) = e^{-i\\alpha t} \\) (where \\( \\alpha \\) is another constant) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the result still be a delta function centered at the original \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation changes the frequency component of the signal; the new function becomes \\( e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t} \\). Its Fourier transform results in a delta function centered at \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\) instead of \\( \\omega \\), demonstrating the shift in frequency due to the intervention.",
