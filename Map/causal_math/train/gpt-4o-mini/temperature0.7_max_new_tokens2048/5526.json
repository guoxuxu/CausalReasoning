  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the consequences of applying a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( Mz = az + b \\\\), with \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) being complex numbers.\n\nAfter observing the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( M \\\\), it is impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because both the scaling and shifting parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in \\\\( M \\\\) could have altered the initial conditions in ways that cannot be uniquely reversed solely based on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The time-dependent function z(t) changes over time as described by the differential equation, which influences its state at time T, z(T). The final state z(T) is determined by the initial state z_0, but it is also influenced by whether the linear transformation M was applied. The transformation M affects z by transforming it into az + b, which impacts the calculation of the initial state z_0.",
