  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing the angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time is analyzed.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T without prior knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation adds a convolution-like effect which modifies the phase and amplitude, obscuring the original form. Without knowledge of how \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, recovering the exact initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) just from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) is unachievable.",
