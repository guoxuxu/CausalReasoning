  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \\\\), used as a transformation within the context of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) where \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). The system investigates how transformations affect the Laplace transform of the function over the variable s.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is transformed via \\\\( T \\\\) at s = 1, will the transformed function \\\\( h(s) = T[g](s) \\\\) at s = 1 remain affected if the function form or the value of s changes to s = 2 without further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) is dependent on the value of s due to its definition through the exponential factor in the Laplace transform. Changing s from 1 to 2 alters the exponential decay rate, impacting the resulting transform distinctly even if g(z) remains the same.",
