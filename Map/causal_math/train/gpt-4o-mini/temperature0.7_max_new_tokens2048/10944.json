  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation via a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\\\). Let's examine the effects of modifying the function in the frequency domain and then applying the inverse transformation to recover the signal in the time domain.\n\nGiven the modified time-domain function after an unknown filtering operation in the frequency domain, can we precisely determine the original unaltered function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the filter \\\\( h(w) \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the filter \\\\( h(w) \\\\) used in the frequency domain, multiple combinations of original functions and filters can result in the same modified time-domain output, rendering it impossible to definitively separate and identify \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(w) \\\\).",
