  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation represented by the operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iws} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then the resulting function is left to evolve under the same \\\\( f(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) without additional transformations, does this reproduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) fundamentally changes the function by integrating it with a complex exponential factor. This operation results in a different function representation, which does not transform back into \\\\( z(t) \\\\) merely by further evolution under \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\).",
