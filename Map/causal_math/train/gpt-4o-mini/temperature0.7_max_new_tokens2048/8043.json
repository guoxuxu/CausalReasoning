  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The differential equation governing the dynamics is \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the system's inherent dynamics under \\\\( -i\\\\lambda \\\\), and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Specifically, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be represented as \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda (T - t_1)} e^{i\\\\theta} e^{-i\\\\lambda t_1} e^{i\\\\omega t_1} z_0 \\\\), showing dependencies on all parameters.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(z) transforms z, which influences the rate of change dz/dt. The rate of change dz/dt is determined by the constant λ, and this rate affects the end state z(T). The function g(z) also transforms z, but the transformation depends on the constant θ. The transformation by f(z) is influenced by ω, but the end state z(T) is determined solely by λ and the dynamics of dz/dt.",
