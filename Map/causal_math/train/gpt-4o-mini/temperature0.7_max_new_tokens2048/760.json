  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\), and a transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. This transformation represents an integral transformation affecting the signal over time.\n\nBased on the observed end condition \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to confidently backtrack and determine which transformations (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "The different potential paths through which the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) affect the signal make it complex to uniquely distinguish which transformations were used solely based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The integral and exponential nature of these transformations mean various combinations could yield the same end result, obscuring their distinct contributions.",
