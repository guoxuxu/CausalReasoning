  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing its transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T without any earlier knowledge?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z)(t) \\\\) results in an integral that blends the effects of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T, obscuring direct information about the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) unless additional constraints or information about \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is known.",
