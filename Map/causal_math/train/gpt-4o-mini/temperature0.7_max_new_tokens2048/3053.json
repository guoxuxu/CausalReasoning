  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time Markov chain with state space \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\) governed by the transition rate matrix \\\\(Q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -\\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\). We are investigating the effect of modifying transition rates with a scalar function \\\\(f(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transition rates are scaled by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) initially at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the original Markov process without further intervention, will the probability of being in state 2 at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if no scaling was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the transition rates by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) modifies the rates \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\lambda e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\), respectively. This alteration changes the dynamics of the Markov chain, affecting the state probabilities at any future time \\\\(t = T\\\\) different from the unmodified system.",
