  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by scaling \\\\( z_0 \\\\), which changes the trajectory of the system. The growth factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) influences how the solution to the differential equation unfolds over time, leading to a different state at time T.",
