  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( z \\) depends on the input \\( x \\) through a linear transformation and an integral transform with kernel \\( K(s, t) \\). Specifically, \\( z(t) = \\int_0^T K(s, t) x(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( T \\) is a fixed time horizon.\n\nIf \\( x(s) \\) is given as \\( x(s) = e^{As}x_0 \\) (where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition), will the output \\( z(T) \\) solely depend on the kernel \\( K(s, t) \\) and not on the specifics of \\( A \\) or \\( x_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( z(T) \\) depends on the convolution of \\( K(s, t) \\) and \\( x(s) \\). Since \\( x(s) \\) itself is influenced by \\( A \\) and the initial condition \\( x_0 \\), these elements directly affect \\( z(T) \\). The kernel \\( K(s, t) \\) modulates this effect but does not override the influence of \\( A \\) and \\( x_0 \\).",
