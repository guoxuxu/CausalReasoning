  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a linear operator in a complex function space. We investigate how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), the transformation effects could disguise the actual initial conditions through modifications in the frequency domain, making it infeasible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) just by observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
