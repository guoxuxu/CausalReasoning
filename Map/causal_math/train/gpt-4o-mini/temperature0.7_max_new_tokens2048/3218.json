  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the continuous mapping of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a real constant, and z represents a complex variable. This function is then subjected to a transformation via a linear operator T that acts as an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} e^{st} f(1-s) ds \\\\), where c and s are complex variables and t is a real parameter.\n\nIs it possible to exactly retrieve the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at z = 0 purely by observing the output of T at t = T without prior knowledge of the transformation executed by T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation by T involves complex exponential components that can significantly modify the original function, making it infeasible to reverse engineer to the original function without explicit knowledge of the transformations applied.",
