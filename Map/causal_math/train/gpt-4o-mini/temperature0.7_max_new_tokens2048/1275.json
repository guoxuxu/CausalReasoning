  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{tA}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( g(t, x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sB}x \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix, applied at time zero.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) is introduced at time zero in addition to \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), will the output at \\\\( T \\\\) depend solely on the initial vector and matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) at the initial time imposes an additional transformation through matrix \\\\( B \\\\), resulting in an integral impact alongside the exponential effect of matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\) is thus influenced by both matrices, \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), affecting the evolution of the system in a combined manner.",
