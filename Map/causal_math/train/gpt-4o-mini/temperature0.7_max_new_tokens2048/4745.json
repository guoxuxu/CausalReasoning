  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are looking at how integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, affect the function over time.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) is subjected to a Laplace transformation without any further modification, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) indicate the same frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) as the original complex function?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) is \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\), which clearly indicates the presence of the original frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as part of the transform's pole. Therefore, the frequency component is preserved through the transformation.",
