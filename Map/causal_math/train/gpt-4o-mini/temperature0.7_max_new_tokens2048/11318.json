  "Problem": "We are given a complex system where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) modifies a vector \\\\( x \\\\) in a vector space over the complex numbers. The angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is constant, and the system evolves according to the operator \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x = -i\\omega x \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system with and without interventions involving a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) and the evolution operator \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x \\\\) are harmoniously aligned and merely rotate the phase of the vector, the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) can be accurately determined from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by reversing the phase shift.",
