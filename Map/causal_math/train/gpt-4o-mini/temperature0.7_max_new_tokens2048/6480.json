  "Problem": "A vector field $V(z)$ in the complex plane behaves according to the equation $V(z) = z^n$ where $n$ is an integer. We examine the consequences of applying a transformation $f(z) = e^{i \\theta}z$ where $\\theta$ is a constant angle.\n\nGiven the endpoint $V(z(T))$, can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether $f(z)$, $g(z)$, or both), just by knowing the value of $V(z(T))$?",
  "Explanation": "The final output $V(z(T))$ can result from different angles of rotations provided by $f(z)$ and $g(z)$. Due to the complex exponential function’s property of angle addition, multiple combinations of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ might result in the same endpoint after exponentiation, obscuring the specific interventions used.",
