  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with D being a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the function at initial time t = 0, namely \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at time T (post-evolution), can we accurately retrieve the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transformation was applied beforehand?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is invertible and the evolution is deterministically governed by the given PDE, one can work backward from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform and the known evolution law to precisely recover \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x, t) influences its time derivative ∂u/∂t, and the function u(x, t) also influences its spatial second derivative ∂²u/∂x². The time derivative ∂u/∂t is influenced by the diffusion coefficient D, while the spatial second derivative ∂²u/∂x² is also influenced by D. The initial function u(x, 0) leads to the Fourier transform at initial time hat{u}(k, 0). The Fourier transform at initial time hat{u}(k, 0) evolves to hat{u}(k, T) at time T. Finally, the evolved Fourier transform hat{u}(k, T) allows for the retrieval of the initial condition u(x, 0).",
