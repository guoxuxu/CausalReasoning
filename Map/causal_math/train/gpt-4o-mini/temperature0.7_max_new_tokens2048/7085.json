  "Problem": "Consider a complex function governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform resulting in a transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed via Laplace transform without any modifications, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) uniquely depend on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) directly depends on the form of \\\\( A \\\\). The exponential function's behavior is characterized by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\\\( A \\\\), and thus, so is the transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\). This relationship is preserved and explicit in the absence of any intervention.",
