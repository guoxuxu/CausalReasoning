  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Fourier Transform applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, which is then subjected to operations described by a differential equation \\\\( L[g(x)] = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dx^2} - k^2g \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}g(x)dx \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), and then the differential equation is solved without further intervention, will the transformed solution \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) directly give us the function form in frequency domain that satisfies the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform changes the function into the frequency domain. Solving the differential equation in the frequency domain involves additional steps, like manipulating the transformed function to accommodate the differential operator in terms of \\\\( k \\\\). Direct transformation does not automatically solve the differential equation.",
