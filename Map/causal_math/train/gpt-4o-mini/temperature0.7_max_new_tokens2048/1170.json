  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions describing a physical system. We investigate a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency, applied to this system over time \\( t \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the influence of the transformation \\( f(z) \\), particularly the parameter \\( \\omega \\), it is impossible to reverse engineer and uniquely determine \\( z_0 \\). The effect of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) on the dynamics could vary the phase of \\( z_0 \\) significantly, obscuring the original state.",
