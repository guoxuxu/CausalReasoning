  "Problem": "A function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined in the complex plane and its evolution is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, and analyze its effects on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially at t = 0 modifies the starting condition to \\\\( e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\). Since the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from this altered start will not match the evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unmodified, due to the exponential factor introduced by D, affecting amplitude and phase.",
