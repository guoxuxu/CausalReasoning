  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is a matrix applied to a vector field in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex variable and B is another constant matrix, mapping real numbers to complex numbers.\n\nIf given the state of the system at \\\\( z = T \\\\) as a result of initial conditions transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and subsequently by \\\\( f(x) = Ax \\\\), without knowing B, can we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about B and the effect of \\\\( e^{iBz} \\\\) on the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) precludes a definitive reverse mapping to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The transformation caused by B introduces complexities and potential shifts in the phase or magnitude that cannot be undone without specific knowledge of B.",
