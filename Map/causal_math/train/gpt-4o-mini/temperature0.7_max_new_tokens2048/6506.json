  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}(t-s)X(s) ds\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and X(s) is a time-dependent input function. We explore the impact of modifying the input via the transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Bt}X(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original input function \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the input was altered by \\\\( g(X) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( X(t) \\\\) because the transformation effect of B may have changed the dynamics of the input in ways that are not recoverable solely from the output state \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
