  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing application where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( X(f) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). The transformed signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by a frequency response \\\\( H(f) \\\\). We are particularly interested in the impact of modifying the signal processing steps with the inclusion of an inverse Fourier transform defined by \\\\( x'(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\{X'(f)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\).\n\nGiven the modified signal \\\\( x'(t) \\\\), can we infer the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowledge about \\\\( H(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( H(f) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly reverse the effects signified by \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\). The modification by \\\\( H(f) \\\\) could fundamentally alter certain frequencies making it impossible to unambiguously reconstruct \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) without this information.",
