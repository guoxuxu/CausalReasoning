  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across an object is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity, and \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effects of applying a thermal source function described by \\\\( f(u) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} u \\\\) on the temperature distribution over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the thermal source \\\\( f(u) \\\\) initially modifies the temperature distribution due to \\\\( \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} u \\\\) that decays exponentially with time but impacts the initial and subsequent temperature distribution at T, altering the system's trajectory away from that due solely to diffusive spread.",
