  "Problem": "Consider a physical system under the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 \\\\phi = \\\\rho\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is the potential field and \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the charge density. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform to both sides of the equation in the context of changing system conditions.\n\nIf an external field is introduced as an intervention affecting \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\), and only the resultant \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is measured, can the Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) indicate this external influence distinctly?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an external field alters \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\), which modifies \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) under the Poisson equation. Since these changes are reflected in \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) will still indicate the change. The properties of the Fourier transform allow it to capture these influences as variations in the frequency domain, distinguishing the impact of external fields.",
