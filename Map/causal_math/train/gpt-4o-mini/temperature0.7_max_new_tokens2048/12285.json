  "Problem": "Investigate a discrete dynamical system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant square matrix representing the evolution operator, and \\\\( x_n \\\\) is the state vector at the n-th step. We also explore the influence on the system of applying a nonlinear transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a constant vector.\n\nGiven the state vector \\\\( x_n \\\\) at step n, is it possible to infer whether the initial transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\), assuming no other interventions took place and without knowing \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the vector \\\\( u \\\\), and given that linear transformations and vector additions can yield equivalent outcomes from different initial states, one cannot definitively trace whether \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was altered by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) initially. There can be multiple starting points and transformations producing the same outcome at step n.",
