  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{V} = LV\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear operator describing the system's inductance matrix. Analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\(\\phi(V) = e^{Mt}V\\), where \\(M\\) is another inductance matrix, on the voltage \\(V\\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nIf \\(V(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\) is observed without knowledge of whether \\(\\phi(V)\\) was applied at \\(t=0\\), can the original vector \\(V_0\\) be accurately deduced?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\(\\phi(V)\\) was applied, it is unfeasible to accurately deduce \\(V_0\\) since the transformation \\(e^{Mt}\\) could have altered the original conditions in a manner that isn't traceable without specific knowledge of \\(M\\) and how it interacts with \\(L\\).",
