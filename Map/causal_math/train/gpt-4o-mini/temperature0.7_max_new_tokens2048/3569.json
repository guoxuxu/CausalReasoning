  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex constant vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to this function over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under its defined dynamics without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be equivalent to transforming the time-evolved function directly at any other t?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a frequency-shifted signal essentially results in a displacement in the frequency domain. Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) initially or later does not change this property since the additional phase added by the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is consistent across the Fourier transform. Thus, the result is invariant under the time evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
