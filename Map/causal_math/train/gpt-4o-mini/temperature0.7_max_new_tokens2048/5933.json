  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) obey the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. We explore the scenario by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from t = 0, does this transformation affect the time-domain behavior of the system under the given differential equation for future times t > 0?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator and does not alter the time-domain system's state or dynamics; it merely provides a different representation (frequency domain) of the data without interacting or modifying the underlying differential equation governing \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
