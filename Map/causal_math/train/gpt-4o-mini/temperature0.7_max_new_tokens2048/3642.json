  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that represents the temperature distribution over a rod, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We analyze the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). The presence of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) as a potential modification at t = 0 means there are multiple compatible initial states for any given distribution at time T, influenced by the different potential amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal term.",
