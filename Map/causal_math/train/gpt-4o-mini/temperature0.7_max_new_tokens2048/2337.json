  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation where a signal x(t) is first converted to X(s) using the Laplace transformation. The transformed signal X(s) is then modified by a multiplicative function H(s), which acts as a system's transfer function. Finally, the modified signal Y(s) = H(s)X(s) is converted back to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transformation to yield y(t).\n\nIf the original signal x(t) changes slightly, will the resulting output y(t) after processing also exhibit a change?",
  "Explanation": "Since Y(s) is directly affected by X(s) through the relation Y(s) = H(s)X(s), a change in x(t) leading to variation in X(s) will necessarily modify Y(s), and subsequently, y(t) will change. The linear nature of both the Laplace transformation and the system's multiplication rule ensures that output variations are causally connected to input variations.",
