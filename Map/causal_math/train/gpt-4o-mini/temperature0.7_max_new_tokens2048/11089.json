  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where c is a speed constant. Study the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t,x)) \\\\) on the spatial variable.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(0,x)) \\\\) is calculated and the system evolves under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the Fourier transformed state at time T, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T,x)) \\\\), reflect the pure natural evolution of the waveform under this PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform decomposes the waveform into frequency components, which evolve independently under the wave equation. Each frequency component evolves according to its wave number, adhering strictly to the rules of the differential equation. Thus, the transformed state reflects the system's natural evolution unaffected by the transformation itself.",
