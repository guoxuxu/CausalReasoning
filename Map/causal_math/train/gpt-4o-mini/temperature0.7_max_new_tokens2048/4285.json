  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of the Laplace transform on this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to its definition without any intervention, will the Laplace transform at any complex value \\\\( s \\\\) remain \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), assuming \\\\( \\mathrm{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\). Without any intervention, this functional relationship holds at any point in the evolution since the transform is derived directly from the function's time evolution without modifications.",
