  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{-k^2 t} \\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform, on the temporal evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear knowledge of whether the transform \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied, and given the irreversible nature of certain integral transformations (loss of specific frequency information), reconstructing the exact original state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is generally infeasible.",
