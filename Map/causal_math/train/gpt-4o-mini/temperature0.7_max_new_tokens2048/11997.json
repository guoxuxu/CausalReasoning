  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The complex function transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) can we deduce the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) being applied, the presence of the exponential term \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) affects the inversion process, making it ambiguous to recover the original \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) precisely due to the non-trivial time-dependent factor.",
