  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) according to the integral transformation \\\\( V(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)/RC} I(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where R and C are constants representing the resistance and capacitance, respectively.\n\nIf the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is set to a fixed function and allowed to proceed without any intervention, will the output voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) solely depend on the behavior of \\\\( I(t) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation strictly depends on the history of \\\\( I(t) \\\\) from 0 to T through the convolution integral, the output \\\\( V(T) \\\\) at time T is determined entirely by the input current function within that interval, without influence from external factors.",
