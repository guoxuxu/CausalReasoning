  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The differential equation governing the dynamics is \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). When this new initial condition evolves, the solution to the differential equation is \\\\( z(t) = e^{-i\\\\lambda t}e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) rather than \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda t}z_0 \\\\), representing a phase shift introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
