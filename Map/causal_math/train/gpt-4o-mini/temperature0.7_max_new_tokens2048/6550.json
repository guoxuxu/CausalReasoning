  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We examine the system's response to the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{St} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( S \\\\) being a constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we trace back to determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without clarity on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, because the transformation could have substantially altered the input. Without this knowledge, multiple distinct initial states could lead to the same observed endpoint due to the integration effect.",
