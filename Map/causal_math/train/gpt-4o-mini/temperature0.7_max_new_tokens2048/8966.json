  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x, y, t) + iv(x, y, t) \\\\), a complex-valued function of two spatial variables and time, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions.\n\nGiven a final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing how the function evolved temporally if no interventions have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Even without intervention, the loss of phase information and the nuances introduced by the Laplacian operator in a complex function setting can result in multiple potential initial states giving rise to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to precisely backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
