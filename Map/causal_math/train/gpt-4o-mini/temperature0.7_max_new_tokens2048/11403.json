  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) models the energy states in a two-dimensional space depending on positions x and y. We explore the effect of a rotational transformation defined by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) applied to a vector \\\\( v = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( S \\\\), defined by scaling \\\\( S = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( v \\\\) after the initial rotational transformation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\), will the final energy state \\\\( z \\\\) be independent of the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even after adding a scaling transformation, the final energy state as calculated by  \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) will be affected solely by changes in the magnitudes of x and y, regardless of their rotational position. While the scale alters the magnitude, the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) does not affect the calculation of \\\\( z \\\\).",
