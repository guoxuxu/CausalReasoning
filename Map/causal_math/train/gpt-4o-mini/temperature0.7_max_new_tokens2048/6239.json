  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix \\\\omega} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) on the solution.\n\nIf a modification \\\\(M(v) = Av\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the endpoint solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(L\\\\) and not on the initial Fourier transform or the matrix \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(M(v)\\\\) introduces an additional variable that alters how the solution evolves under the operator \\\\(L\\\\). The initial Fourier transform and the matrix \\\\(A\\\\) both influence the resulting endpoint, affecting its behavior in frequency space and complicating the dependency purely on \\\\(L\\\\).",
