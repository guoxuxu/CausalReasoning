  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a constant real matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, influences z(t) over time.\n\nCan we deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = k*pi/A, without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to distinguish whether \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was raised to a power k or not, as multiple initial states \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could lead to the same observation at T = k*pi/A because of the complex function's periodic nature.",
