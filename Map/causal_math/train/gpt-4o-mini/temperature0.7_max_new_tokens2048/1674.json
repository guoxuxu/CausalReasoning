  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model involving a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) a real number frequency parameter. The integral transform of this function with respect to time using the Laplace transform is analyzed.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the function at time T, can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) used to generate this function without knowing it beforehand?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of complex exponentials and the similarity in their Laplace transforms across different frequencies imply multiple potential frequencies could yield similar transform outputs. Without initial frequency information, precise determination of \\\\(\\omega\\\\) from sole final data is ambiguous.",
