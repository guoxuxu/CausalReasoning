  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) evolving over time \\( t \\) with \\( \\omega \\) a real constant. An operation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) transforms \\( z(t) \\) into \\( z'(t) = \\mathcal{T}(z(t)) = z(t) + ce^{dt} \\) where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are complex constants.\n\nKnowing \\( z'(T) \\), is it possible to determine which transformations (\\( \\mathcal{T} \\), \\( \\mathcal{U} \\), or both) were applied during the interval \\( [0, T] \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity added by transformations \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{U} \\), \\( z'(T) \\) can be reached by various combinations of \\( c \\), \\( d \\), and \\( a \\) along with different initial conditions. This overlap and non-uniqueness make it impossible to pinpoint exactly what transformations were applied within the given interval just by observing \\( z'(T) \\).",
