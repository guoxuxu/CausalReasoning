  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\), where \\\\( W \\\\) is a complex constant, we consider the impact of the transformation map \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) where \\\\( J \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, we lack crucial information about initial transformations that might have changed the trajectory of the system. Since \\\\( J \\\\) could have introduced an unknown twist or rotation in the complex plane, reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely is not feasible.",
