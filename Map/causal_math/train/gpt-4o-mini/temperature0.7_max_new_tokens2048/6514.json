  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(k) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) given by the integral transformation \\\\( F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} f(x) dx \\\\). We aim to evaluate how the application of a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\), defined as \\\\( Df(x) = f'(x) \\\\), influences the Fourier transformed function.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(k) \\\\) after computing the Fourier transform of \\\\( Df(x) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the effect of the derivative in the Fourier space is discernible as multiplication by \\\\( -ik \\\\), the precise recovery of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( -ik F(k) \\\\) alone is not guaranteed without knowing initial or boundary conditions due to potential loss of information (e.g., constants in integration).",
