  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a linear transformation on a complex function. Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, representing a unit circle in the complex plane. The transformation given is \\\\( T(z) = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( U(z) = mz \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial function and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) further modifies the magnitude of the state, and thus both the initial transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( U(z) \\\\) affect the final state at time T. The result is dependent on both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\), alongside the natural evolution of the angle in \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\).",
