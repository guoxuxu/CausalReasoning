  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. Assume an external transformation is defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{wt}z \\\\), where w is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{ut}z \\\\) (where u is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of w and only dependent on i and u?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on i, w, and u. The transformations \\\\( e^{wt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{ut} \\\\) interact with the dynamical system, affecting the system's trajectory and hence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
