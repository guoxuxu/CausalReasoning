  "Problem": "Consider a Riemann surface defined by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\lambda t} \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is a complex constant. The function \\( T(z) = z^k \\) is used as a transformation where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nFrom observing \\( z'(t) = (e^{i\\lambda t})^k \\) at t = T, can we conclude that \\( z_0 \\) was indeed the original starting point without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformation \\( T(z) \\), the trajectory \\( z'(t) \\) at any t can be uniquely determined back to \\( z_0 = 1 \\) because the power \\( k \\) and the exponential nature of \\( z(t) \\) allow for a direct conclusion about its initial form. Thus, the effect \\( z'(t) \\) preserves the information about the initial state \\( z_0 \\).",
