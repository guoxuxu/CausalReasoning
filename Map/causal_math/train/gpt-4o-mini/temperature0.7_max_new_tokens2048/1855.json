  "Problem": "Consider the space of complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Suppose we apply an integral transformation represented by \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nSuppose at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention. Will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the original differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z)\\\\) introduces a scaling factor that perturbs the original dynamic governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\). The exponential factor \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) affects the trajectory and, consequently, \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), altering the integration outcome in the transformation formula.",
