  "Problem": "Consider a system involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions governed by linear differential equations, and i represents the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T and knowing that a transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) might have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) changes the initial conditions in an irrecoverable way unless the exact value of B and the time of application are known. The angle of rotation added by B may lead to multiple potential initial values \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
