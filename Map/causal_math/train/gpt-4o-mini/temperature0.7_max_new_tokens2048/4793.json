  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}\\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a function of real variable t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves naturally without any external intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\), for t > 0, solely depend on the parameter A?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} e^{At} dt \\\\) simplifies to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\), displaying a dependency only on A. Since there are no additional transformations or external factors applied, the transform outcome is determined exclusively by A.",
