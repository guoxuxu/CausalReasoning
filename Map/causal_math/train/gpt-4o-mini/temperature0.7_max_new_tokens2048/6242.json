  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with complex function mappings characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation described by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix affecting complex functionalities.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to backtrack accurately to determine the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory leading to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could have been altered by the exponential transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). Without knowing the specific influence of C, or whether it was applied, it is impossible to determine the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as both C and D influence the evolution in a non-trivial and possibly non-invertible way.",
