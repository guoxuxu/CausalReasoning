  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a certain domain with prescribed boundary conditions. Suppose an operator \\\\( T: u(x) \\\\mapsto u(x) + c \\\\cos(x) \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, is applied externally.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can one confirm whether transformations \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\) or both were applied based solely on \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) could counteract or modify each other in a way that makes their individual or combined application indiscernible at time \\\\( t \\\\). Multiple paths with different interventions could lead to similar or identical final states, adding ambiguity to any backward inference from effect to cause.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The state u(x, t) can be transformed by operator T to yield T(u(x)), which adds a constant c times the cosine of x to u(x). The operator S can also transform u(x, t) to another state, but its specific effect is not defined here. The transformation T depends on the constant c.",
