  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a continuous time Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform of the same function. Let \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and let \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an alteration like \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2}t^2 \\\\) is introduced at some point and then Laplace transformation is applied, does the outcome depend solely on parameter \\\\( a \\\\) without being influenced by the Fourier transformation properties?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome after applying the Laplace transform to the altered function does depend on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) but it's also nuanced by the integral transform properties specific to Laplace, which are different from Fourier. The additional \\\\( t^2 \\\\) term changes the nature of both the function and resultant transform, which cannot be purely correlated to the original Fourier transform properties.",
