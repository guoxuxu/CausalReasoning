  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor R and an inductor L in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(V(t)\\\\) denotes the applied voltage. We introduce a transformation \\\\(g(I) = I + ct\\\\), where c is a constant, applied to the current I at time t.\n\nIf an additional voltage source \\\\(V'(t) = kt\\\\), where k is a constant, is added at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention, will the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) only depend on the parameters R and L and not on the functions g or the added voltage term k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with an additional linearly increasing voltage source introduces another modifying factor to the original system equation. This additional term affects the differential equation's solution from time \\\\(t_1\\\\) onwards, making the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) dependent on the terms associated with \\\\(g(I)\\\\), R, L, as well as the parameters k and t.",
