  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The system is analyzed under the transformation defined by the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-At^2} \\\\).\n\nGiven the final observed output after the interventions, can we decipher exactly what transformations (either \\\\( e^{-At^2} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-Ct} \\\\) or both) were originally applied, merely by observing the end result?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of functions and intervening transformations can lead to indistinguishable outcomes due to complexities in how the transformations imposed by A and C impact the resultant function. The end result might not necessarily reveal discernible clues about which specific transformations or sequences of transformations were applied.",
