  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) not only alters the initial magnitude by multiplying with \\\\( e^{\\alpha t} \\\\), but also changes the trajectory's exponential growth or decay rate. Hence, the trajectory at time T is different.",
