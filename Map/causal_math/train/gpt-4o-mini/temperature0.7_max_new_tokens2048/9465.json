  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in terms of spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the PDE \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) under the same PDE and then applying \\\\(F\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Under the linear PDE, the Fourier transform of the evolved state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) will be equivalent to the evolution in the Fourier space of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) since the Fourier Transform linearly diagonalizes \\\\(L\\\\), assuming \\\\(L\\\\) is a translation-invariant operator. Hence, transformations and time evolutions can commute.",
