  "Problem": "Contemplate a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves as per the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the scenario under a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant frequency.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( U(z) = z e^{-i\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant frequency) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). These frequency shifts and phase alterations influence continuously throughout the evolution and affect the final state at T.",
