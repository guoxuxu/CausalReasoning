  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function space such that \\\\( L \\\\) represents a Fourier Transformation, and we investigate the impact of an additional operator \\\\( M \\\\) which applies a convolution transformation with a fixed kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformation result of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (either \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or \\\\( N \\\\) or combinations thereof), and in what order, by only knowing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The potential for overlap in effects due to the convolutions and Fourier transformation, and their dependency on the initial function and each other's subsequent applications, makes it impossible to precisely and uniquely identify the transformations and their order from the final state alone.",
