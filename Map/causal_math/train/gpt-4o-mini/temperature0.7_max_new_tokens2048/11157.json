  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nIf a transformation \\( T(z) \\) is applied to a function \\( z_0(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then the function is allowed to evolve under the Cauchy-Riemann equations without further intervention, will \\( T(z(t)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( z_0(t) \\) was directly transformed to \\( t = T \\) under \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T(z) \\) integrates \\( z(t) \\) over time with a factor \\( e^{-st} \\), which alters the original function's trajectory. Since the integration and the exponential factor add non-trivial contributions, the outcome at \\( t = T \\) will differ from a direct transformation under \\( T(z) \\).",
