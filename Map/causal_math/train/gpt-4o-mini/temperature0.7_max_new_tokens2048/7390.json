  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real constant and t is time. We will analyze scenarios pertaining to a Laplace transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iA} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the value of A?",
  "Explanation": "From the transform result \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - iA} \\\\), it is clear that A can be uniquely determined as A is the imaginary component of the pole s. The relationship is direct and permits retrieval of the original parameter A.",
