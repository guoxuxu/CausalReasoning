  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing system where a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) modulates an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) according to the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\). \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then analyzed at various time points t using a Fourier transform.\n\nCan we determine precisely what interventions were used (the type of filters or no filter), by examining the output \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The spectral output \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) could result from various combinations of initial modulations and subsequent filtering operations. Different initial conditions and filters can produce similar or identical frequency spectra, particularly if the characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the filter overlap or mask each other's effects.",
