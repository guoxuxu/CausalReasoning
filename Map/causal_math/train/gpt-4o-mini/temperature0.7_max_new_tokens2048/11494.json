  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{Aw} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and w is a complex variable. Suppose we perform an integral transformation on z(w) given by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sw}z(w) dw \\\\), where s is another complex constant.\n\nCan we determine the original function form \\\\( z(w) = e^{Aw} \\\\) from the transformed output \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) without knowing s?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the form of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) from \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) requires knowledge of s, as the transformation with s significantly modifies the integration process. Without s, reconstructing the exact form of A or deducing that the exponential function involves A becomes infeasible.",
