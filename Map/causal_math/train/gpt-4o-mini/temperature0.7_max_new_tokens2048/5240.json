  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x + e^{iBt}y \\\\) where x and y are constant vectors and A, B are constant matrices. The function describes the evolution of a vector in a complex plane subjected to two rotational effects.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine if the intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) was applied, solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of the initial vectors x, y, and the matrices A, B, C. Without specific details on when and how the intervention was applied, multiple configurations could lead to the same endpoint, making it impossible to uniquely identify the intervention.",
