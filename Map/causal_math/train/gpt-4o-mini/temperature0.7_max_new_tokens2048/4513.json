  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\), where M represents a square matrix. We explore the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) at some initial condition and examine its impact on system dynamics.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is subsequently allowed to progress under \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T exactly correspond to evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the state of the system by transforming the function into its frequency components. The evolution of these components under \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\) can differ from the original time-domain evolution, thereby altering the state dynamically at time T.",
