  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions with specific transformations applied.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where the parameters change to \\\\( a' \\\\) and \\\\( b' \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the original parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( a' \\\\) and \\\\( b' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing the parameters to \\\\( a' \\\\) and \\\\( b' \\\\) alters the nature of the exponential transformation post \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the original and the new parameters, reflecting a composite effect of both transformations.",
