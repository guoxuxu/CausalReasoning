  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in integral calculus defined as \\\\( u = g(x) \\\\) where g is a continuously differentiable function. We analyze the impact of changing variables from x to u in the definite integral \\\\( \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( du = g'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nIf we intervene by adjusting the transformed integral’s bounds to new values \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) after applying \\\\( u = g(x) \\\\), will the result of \\\\( \\\\int_c^d f(g^{-1}(u)) \\\\frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(u))} \\\\, du \\\\) still reflect the value of \\\\( \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the bounds of integration after a variable transformation means the integral will generally no longer reflect the value of the original integral over [a, b]. The new bounds c and d may correspond to a completely different range in the x-variables and thus a different integral value.",
