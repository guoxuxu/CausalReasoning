  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is defined as the Laplace transform. We examine the effects this transformation has on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) exactly after observing its frequency domain representation obtained via \\\\( L \\\\) without knowing \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the frequency domain representation from the Laplace transform, the constants \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the poles and residues of the transform, thus allowing full reconstruction of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
