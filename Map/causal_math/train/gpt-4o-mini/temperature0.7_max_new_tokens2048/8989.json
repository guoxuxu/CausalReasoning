  "Problem": "Consider the application of a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We analyze the impact of this transformation over time when the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is combined with another transformed function under different scenarios.\n\nIf the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\) is taken resulting in \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then this result is used directly in a system analysis without further intervention, will the properties of \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) uniquely determine the behavior in the frequency domain compared to directly analyzing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform translates all information of the time domain function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain without loss of information. The behavior of \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain will uniquely correspond to the behavior of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in the time domain, ensuring a one-to-one mapping.",
