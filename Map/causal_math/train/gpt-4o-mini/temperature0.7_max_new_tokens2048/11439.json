  "Problem": "Let us consider a system of linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-iwt}dt \\\\), on this system over time.\n\nIf a control input represented by a matrix \\\\( N \\\\) is added into the system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\) and a Fourier transform is applied, will the spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) only reflect the properties of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) at frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the control input \\\\( N \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the system. The resulting spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) will then be a function not only of the matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) but also of the nature and timing of the control inputs \\\\( u(t) \\\\) applied, affecting how these matrix properties are represented in the frequency domain.",
