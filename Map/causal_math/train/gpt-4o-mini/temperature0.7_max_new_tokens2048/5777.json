  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t, z) dt \\\\), where \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) is a function of both the real variable t and the complex variable z. This transformation maps complex functions into other complex functions using an integral transform influenced by the parameter s.\n\nIf the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) in the integral transform is changed from \\\\( s_0 \\\\) to \\\\( s_1 \\\\) at t = 0, and the transform is then computed without further change, will the resulting function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) for \\\\( s_1 \\\\) be the same as it would be using \\\\( s_0 \\\\) over the entire interval?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) modifies the weighting of the exponential function in the integral transform, thus altering the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The decay rate imparted by \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) directly affects how contributions from \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) are accumulated, leading to a different outcome for differing values of \\\\( s \\\\).",
