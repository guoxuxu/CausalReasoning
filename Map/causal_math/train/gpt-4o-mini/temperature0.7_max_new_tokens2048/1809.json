  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) defined on a contour in the complex plane. The contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) is analyzed over a closed path C. Let \\\\( a \\\\) be a complex constant.\n\nIf the value of \\\\( a \\\\) in the function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) is increased, will the absolute value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( a \\\\) alters the function's growth rate and oscillatory behavior, but due to the complex exponential nature and depending on the path C, the integral might not necessarily increase. The integration over complex contours can result in cancellation effects, depending on the interaction between \\\\( a \\\\) and the geometry of C.",
