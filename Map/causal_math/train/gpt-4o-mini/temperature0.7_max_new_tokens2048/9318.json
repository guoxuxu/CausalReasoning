  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nKnowing that \\\\(x(t)\\\\) satisfies \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), can we conclusively trace back to determine whether the initial vector was \\\\(x_0\\\\) or \\\\(Mx_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\(x_0\\\\) and \\\\(Mx_0\\\\) satisfy the equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) when M is invertible, observing \\\\(x(t)\\\\) satisfying the equation does not uniquely determine whether the transformation was applied or not; both are valid preconditions without further distinguishing information.",
