  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an additional functional transformation \\\\( g(x) = Ux \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is a unitary matrix, on the eigenvalues of the vector \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(x) = Vx \\\\) (where \\\\( V \\\\) is another unitary matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the eigenvalues of the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( U \\\\) or \\\\( V \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Unitary transformations such as \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( V \\\\) preserve eigenvalues; therefore, despite the application of these transformations, the eigenvalues of the system at any time depend only on \\\\( A \\\\), which determines how the space is fundamentally mapped by \\\\( T \\\\).",
