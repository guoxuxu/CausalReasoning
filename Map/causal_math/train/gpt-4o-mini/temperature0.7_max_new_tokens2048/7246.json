  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately determine the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty regarding the application of transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\), there exists ambiguity in reconstructing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) = Ce^{DT}x(T) \\\\). The possible modification of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) by \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) introduces multiple potential original vectors that could result in the same observed outcome at T.",
