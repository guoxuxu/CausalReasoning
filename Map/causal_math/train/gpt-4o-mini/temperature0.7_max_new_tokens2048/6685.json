  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the effect of differentiating this function and the subsequent application of a Fourier transform.\n\nDoes the differentiation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any intervention change the Fourier transform compared to the Fourier transform of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Differentiating \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( i \\\\omega e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), which fundamentally changes the frequency components in the Fourier transform. The transformation results in a translation of the frequency spectrum, inducing a different outcome in the Fourier transform spectrum (specifically, a multiplication by \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\) in the frequency domain).",
