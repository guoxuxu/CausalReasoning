  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency. We assess the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega s}f(s)ds \\\\) over an interval.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a further transformation \\\\( S[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega's}f(s)ds \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\neq \\\\omega \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome for \\\\( T[S[z]](t) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( S \\\\) introduces another frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) into the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since the Fourier transform of exponential functions sensitive to frequency changes, the result of \\\\( T[S[z]](t) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), altering the overall integral transformation results significantly.",
