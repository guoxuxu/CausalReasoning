  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over time t obeys the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. Assume further that a transformation \\\\(g(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u(x,t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant, is applied to study the temperature decay due to radiative loss.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we infer the original distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied, it's impossible to conclusively backtrack to \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) as the exponential factor introduced by \\\\(g(u)\\\\) could have significantly altered the initial conditions, and these changes depend sensitively on the parameter \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\).",
