  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of applying an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(h) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}h(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and T is a fixed time.\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( g(h) \\\\), can we infer the specific range of \\\\( z \\\\) used in the original function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without knowledge of whether the range was specified before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( g(h) \\\\) is an aggregated result of integrating over whatever range was used. Without explicit knowledge of the original range bounds, different ranges could produce the same or similar outputs, especially if the properties of B and A lead to overlapping effects in the transform.",
