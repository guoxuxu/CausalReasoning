  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform of a function g(t) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = G(s) \\\\). We analyze how applying different initial conditions affects the inverse transform at a specific time T, where the initial conditions are modified by a constant k.\n\nGiven an observed output m(T), can we determine exactly which transformations (scaling by k, addition by c, or both) were applied, just by analyzing the value of m(T)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of k and c could yield the same final result at m(T) due to the properties of linear transformations in the Laplace transform domain. Therefore, unless additional information is provided, the precise transformations cannot be uniquely determined.",
