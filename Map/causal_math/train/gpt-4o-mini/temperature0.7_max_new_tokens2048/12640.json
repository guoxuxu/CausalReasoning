  "Problem": "Consider a linear reaction-diffusion system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) on a domain [0, L] with Neumann boundary conditions, where D is a diffusion coefficient and c is a reaction term. We examine the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{0}^{L} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and then the system evolves under \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T be consistent with the evolution given only by the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear and reversible transformation that provides a representation in the frequency domain but does not alter the dynamics governed by the differential equation. The evolution of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) will adhere to the transformed version of the PDE, maintaining consistency with the initial condition transformed at t = 0.",
