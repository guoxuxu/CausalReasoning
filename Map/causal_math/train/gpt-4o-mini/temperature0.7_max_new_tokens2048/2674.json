  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) describing the evolution of a function u(x,t) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes u(x,0) to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0)\\\\) and its impact on the solution space.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial function u(x,0) after obtaining \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > 0 from the Fourier transformed space, without knowing whether a transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial transformation, accurate reconstruction of u(x,0) is compromised. The Fourier components evolve differently under L, and if unaccounted for, the inversion to physical space can lead to inaccurate or ambiguous reconstructions.",
