  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\). We evaluate the use of an exponential transformation defined by the function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\), where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) \\) modifies the initial state, and the nature of the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) heavily depends on initial conditions. The transformation \\( e^{Ct} \\) multiplies the initial state by a factor that evolves exponentially, resulting in a fundamentally different trajectory.",
