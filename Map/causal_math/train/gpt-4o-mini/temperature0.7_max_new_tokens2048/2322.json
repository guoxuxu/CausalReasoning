  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a set of points \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane undergoes a transformation defined by the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Post-transformation, these points are subjected to an integral transformation, \\\\( T(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{iw} dw \\\\).\n\nAfter applying \\\\( T(w) \\\\) to the transformed points, is it possible to reliably infer the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) merely from the resulting value of the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) fundamentally changes the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), reconstructing the original function from the integral's result is nontrivial without additional information. The impact of the complex exponential transformation complicates the inverse operation.",
