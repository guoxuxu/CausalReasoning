  "Problem": "In the context of signal processing, consider a system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) passes through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We study the causal inference of output \\( y(t) \\) resulting from the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) applied to \\( x(t) \\) with frequency representation \\( X(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and similarly \\( Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = H(\\omega)X(\\omega) \\), where \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the transfer function of the system.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of \\( x(t) \\) purely from \\( y(t) \\) without knowing \\( H(\\omega) \\), by reversing the Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transfer function \\( H(\\omega) \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( x(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\) since \\( H(\\omega) \\) could modify or attenuate certain frequencies of \\( X(\\omega) \\), and these changes are indistinguishable in \\( Y(\\omega) \\) alone.",
