  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents an oscillating system in the complex plane. We then apply a Laplace transform to this function, resulting in a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is set to \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves with time without any further changes, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s = iw equal the reciprocal of s (i.e., \\\\( 1 / s \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) leads specifically to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), and not to \\\\( 1 / s \\\\). The transform depends critically on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\), reflecting the influence of the frequency component in the oscillatory behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
