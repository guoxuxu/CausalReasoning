  "Problem": "In a theoretical study, consider the mapping of complex variables using the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) a complex number. This function represents a rotation in the complex plane. We inspect the effects of spatial transformations by separate function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial position \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we know \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the operation performed was only \\\\( e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without any intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}z_0 \\\\) and knowing \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), one can uniquely compute \\\\( z_0 = e^{-iAT}z(T) \\\\). The one-to-one nature of the exponential function in this context allows for the unique inversion to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
