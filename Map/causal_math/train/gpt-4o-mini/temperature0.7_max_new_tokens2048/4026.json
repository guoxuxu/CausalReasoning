  "Problem": "In a control system, the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant system represented by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = H(s)X(s) \\), where \\( H(s) \\) is the transfer function and \\( X(s) \\) is the input in the s-domain. Consider the effect of an additive control intervention \\( u(t) \\) on the system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( U(s) \\). The modified system output is \\( Y(s) = H(s)(X(s) + U(s)) \\).\n\nCan we accurately infer the input \\( X(s) \\) purely from observing the output \\( Y(s) \\) over time, without knowledge of any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Provided that the transfer function \\( H(s) \\) is known and is invertible, the original input \\( X(s) \\) can be deduced from the output \\( Y(s) \\) by calculating \\( X(s) = H(s)^{-1}Y(s) \\), assuming no intervention has altered the input.",
