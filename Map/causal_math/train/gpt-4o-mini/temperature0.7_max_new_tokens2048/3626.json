  "Problem": "Consider a complex analytic function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) tracing a path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, at different time intervals.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the rotational transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it's unclear whether the observed state at time T was due to natural dynamics or a modification by \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Without this information, multiple potential original states could correspond to the same observed state at T.",
