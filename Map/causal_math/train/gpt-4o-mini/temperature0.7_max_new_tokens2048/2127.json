  "Problem": "Consider a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( F(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is an initial function. This scenario examines the effects of various manipulations on the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) in terms of how it impacts \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is modified to be \\\\( g(s) + k(s) \\\\) where \\\\( k(s) \\\\) is another function, will the resultant transformation at time \\\\( T > t_0 \\\\) exclusively reflect the change induced by \\\\( k(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( k(s) \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) to modify \\\\( g(s) \\\\) leads to a new function for the integral, thus the change in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will reflect this addition. This is a causal effect of modifying the input function, which directly alters the outcome by influencing the values integrated over.",
