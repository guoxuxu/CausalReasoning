  "Problem": "Analyze the effect on signal transduction in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution operation with an impulse response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This study involves examining the introduction of a Fourier transform of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) transformed by a function \\\\( F(w) \\\\) and its implications on the system's output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes Fourier transformation by \\\\( F(w) \\\\) to modify its spectrum before being processed by the LTI system, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be the same as if no spectral modification had occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(w) \\\\) alters the frequency components of the input signal. Since the system's output is the convolution of the impulse response with the input, altering the spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes the outcome as manifested in \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
