  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) over time t, with k being a constant complex number.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without information about the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) (i.e., the value or existence of k) makes it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This is because multiple pairs \\\\( k, z_0 \\\\) could lead to the same outcome due to the interaction between complex exponential growth functions.",
