  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Dt}X \\\\) is applied as an intervention, and the system then follows the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) \\\\), does the final output \\\\( F(X_t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( g(X) \\\\) alters the state of the system, which then affects how further dynamics unfold under the integral transform. Therefore, the final output \\\\( F(X_t) \\\\) depends on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\), due to the compounded impact of these transformations on the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix A influences the behavior of X_t, while the stochastic process B_t also affects X_t. The transformation f(X) caused by matrix C leads to F(X_t), and the transformation g(X) caused by matrix D similarly leads to F(X_t). Thus, F(X_t) at time T is influenced by both the transformations and the matrix A.",
