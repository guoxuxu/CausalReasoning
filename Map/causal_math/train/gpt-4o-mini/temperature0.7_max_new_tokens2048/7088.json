  "Problem": "Consider a complex function governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform resulting in a transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) from the Laplace transform of \\\\( f'(t) = e^{Bt}e^{At} \\\\), can we determine precisely which matrices (\\\\( A \\\\) and/or \\\\( B \\\\)) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) can result in the same transformed function \\\\( F'(s) \\\\), particularly if \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) share eigenvalues or spectral properties. The transformed outcome does not provide enough information to disentangle the effects and uniquely specify \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The constant matrix A directly causes the complex function f(z), which in turn causes the Laplace transformed function F(s). The function f(t) is also transformed to F(s) through the Laplace transform. The function f'(t) is caused by the matrix B, and this function f'(t) leads to the derivative F'(s) in the Laplace domain. Additionally, the matrix A also directly influences the function f'(t).",
