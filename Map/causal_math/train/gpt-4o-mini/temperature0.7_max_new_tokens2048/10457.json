  "Problem": "In the examination of a physical system governed by the wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\), where c is the wave speed, consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) applied to u(x, t) and its properties across time and space.\n\nDoes applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0, and evolving it using the transformation properties over time t, yield the same wave profile at t = T as evolving \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) directly under the wave equation without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) evolves in the frequency domain based on the properties of the wave equation, and inverse transforming it back to the spatial domain at any time t = T will yield the same results as directly solving the wave equation in the spatial domain for \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\). The equivalence of the solution methods is maintained due to the linear and reversible nature of the Fourier transform.",
