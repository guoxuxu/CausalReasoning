  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where its Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), with constants a and b. We assess the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) under different transformations and alterations to the original Laplace transform equation.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we uniquely determine the original constants a and b in the expression for \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) provides limited information at a specific instance and multiple pairs of constants (a, b) might result in the same value at that particular time. Without additional data points or constraints, determining a and b uniquely from a single value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible.",
