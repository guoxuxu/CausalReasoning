  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator subjected to complex forcing described by the equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency and C is a complex amplitude. We explore the effects of transformation using the Laplace Transform on the solution.\n\nIf the initial conditions are transformed by the Laplace Transform and the system is then allowed to evolve according to its differential equation without further intervention, will the transformed endpoint differ from the behavior of the original system for large t?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform, while changing the domain of the problem, does not alter the integrity of the system or its time-domain behavior once inversely transformed. Therefore, for large t, the system behavior under the transformation will asymptotically approach that of the original system's behavior as dictated by its characteristic roots.",
