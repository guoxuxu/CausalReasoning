  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of linear operators \\\\( L \\\\) on this system, defined by matrix multiplication on complex numbers in the form \\\\( Lz = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or whether the operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied, without further information?",
  "Explanation": "From the observed state \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\) alone, it is impossible to distinguish whether the initial state was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or a transformed state \\\\( Mz_0 \\\\) due to operator \\\\( L \\\\), unless additional properties of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) are known.",
