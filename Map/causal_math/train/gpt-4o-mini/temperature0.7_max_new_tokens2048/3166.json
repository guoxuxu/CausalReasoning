  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We analyze the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, applied to the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original boundary conditions directly from observing the potential function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at a later time, without knowledge of the application of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the representation of the boundary conditions. Without knowing this modification was made, it’s challenging to accurately map back to the original boundary conditions just from the potential function. Various transformed conditions could lead to similar solutions within the domain.",
