  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system defined by \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x is an initial vector. Evaluate the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we ascertain the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) was applied at time t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking the knowledge about the initial application of \\\\( C \\\\), it is impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( x \\\\) since multiple initial conditions can evolve to the same \\\\( y(T) \\\\) depending on the presence or absence of the transformation \\\\( C \\\\) and the properties of A.",
