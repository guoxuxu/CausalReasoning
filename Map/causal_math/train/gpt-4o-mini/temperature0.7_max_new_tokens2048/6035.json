  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions related to the real and imaginary parts of a complex function subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by applying a factor \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, is introduced to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the new Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{at}z(t)\\\\} \\\\) at s = a + b (where b is another constant) solely depend on the original transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s = b?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{at}z(t) \\\\). The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at}z(t) \\\\) is equivalent to \\\\( Z(s-a) \\\\). Therefore, at s = b + a, the transform depends only on the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) evaluated at s = b.",
