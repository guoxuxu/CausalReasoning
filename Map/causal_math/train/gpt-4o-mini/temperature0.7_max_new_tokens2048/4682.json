  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Suppose the transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after inverse transformation of \\\\( f(z) \\ applied on Z(s), can we certify the exact original Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without evidence about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) since the transformation introduces a modification that can't be resolved solely based on the modified signal \\( x(t) \\).",
