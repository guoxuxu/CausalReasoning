  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) with variable \\\\(t\\\\) representing time. We study the effects of a transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) and explore causal relationships and interventions in the temporal evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nCan the original complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) be deduced after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) was applied, determining \\\\(z_0\\\\) just from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is infeasible. The transformation could alter the evolution making \\\\(z_0\\\\) ambiguous because of the potential change in frequency (phase shift) and magnitude.",
