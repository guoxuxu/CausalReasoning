  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) represent a transfer function in the Laplace transform domain, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We consider the impact of applying a sinusoidal input \\\\( x(t) = \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) and an impulsive function \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\) as inputs into the system described by H(s).\n\nIf an impulse \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\) as an intervention is applied at a certain time \\\\( T \\\\), will the system's output \\\\( y(T + \\epsilon) \\\\) for small \\\\( \\epsilon > 0 \\\\) depend solely on the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on the sinusoidal input?",
  "Explanation": "The impulse intervention at \\\\( t = T \\\\) adds to the existing response of the sinusoidal input. Since the impulse generates a typically sharp and significant change in output at and around \\\\( t = T \\\\), the overall output will reflect contributions both from the continuous sinusoidal input and the discrete impact of the impulse.",
