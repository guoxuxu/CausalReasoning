  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. This scenario explores how the Laplace transform impacts the behavior of the function over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) a modification is made to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by introducing an additional exponential term \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant), does the transformed function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) now depend only on \\\\( s \\\\) rather than both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) results in a new transform, \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} + \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\), where both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) influence the outcome. The function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) distinctly reflects the characteristics of both variables \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).",
