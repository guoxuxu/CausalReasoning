  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real number representing time. We are analyzing how the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t}dt \\\\) affects our understanding of the function's behavior over time.\n\nBased on the Fourier Transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine the exact nature of intervention (whether damping was applied or not)?",
  "Explanation": "The characteristics of the Fourier Transform \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) — particularly its shift and broadening in comparison to \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - 1) \\\\) — will indicate the application of a damping factor. The specific nature of this damping (i.e., \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\)) can be inferred from the changes in the transform's properties.",
