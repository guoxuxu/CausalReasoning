  "Problem": "Let's consider the probability density function \\( p(z) \\) that describes the distribution of a random variable \\( Z \\) undergoing the Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(z)e^{-i\\omega z} dz \\). We investigate how transformations in the time domain and frequency domain affect this PDF.\n\nGiven \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) = e^{-i\\omega a}\\hat{p}(\\omega) \\), can we deduce the value of \\( a \\) properly without knowing the form of \\( p(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the value of \\( a \\) uniquely from \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) \\) requires knowledge about the baseline function \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\). Without knowing \\( p(z) \\), multiple values of \\( a \\) could theoretically correspond to the observed changes in \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) \\), precluding accurate back-calculation of \\( a \\).",
