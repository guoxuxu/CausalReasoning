  "Problem": "Consider a linear electrical circuit analysis where the voltage, \\\\( V(t) \\\\), across a resistor and inductor in series is described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), with R as resistance, L as inductance, and I as the current. Let's analyze the scenario where an operation is performed to transform the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) by a function \\\\( h(I) = I^2 \\\\) just before starting the system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(I) \\\\) squares the initial current \\\\(I_0\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\) starting with this new initial condition, will the function \\\\( I(t) \\\\) for the current at t = T be the same if the initial current was simply \\\\(I_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Squaring the initial current affects the initial state of the system, changing the response of the differential equation. The new initial condition \\\\( I_0^2 \\\\) leads to different solutions for \\\\( I(t) \\\\), thus altering the trajectory of the current over time.",
