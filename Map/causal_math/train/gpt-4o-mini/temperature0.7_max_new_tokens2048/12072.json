  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and matrices A, B, C, and D are constants. We investigate the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) for a constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) will initially rotate the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane. This changes the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), suggesting that the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ by a phase factor of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\), in addition to the effects introduced by the linear system dynamics.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex function z(t) is composed of the real part x(t) and the imaginary part y(t), where x(t) evolves according to the differential equation that depends on both x(t) and y(t), and y(t) changes based on x(t) and y(t) as well. The transformation f(z) applies to the initial complex number z_0, resulting in z(t) evolving from f(z) at t = 0 under the same differential equations that govern x(t) and y(t). Consequently, the state of z(t) at time T depends on its initial state z(t) at time 0.",
