  "Explanation": "Determining the original parameters \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) solely based on the Laplace transform result at time \\\\( T \\\\) is indeterminate without additional constraints or data about the trajectory of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), due to potential equivalences in the transform outcomes from various parameter sets.",
