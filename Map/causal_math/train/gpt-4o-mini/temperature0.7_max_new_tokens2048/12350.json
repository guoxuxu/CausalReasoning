  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional transformation subject to the Laplace Transform (\\\\( L \\\\)) and Inverse Laplace Transform (\\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)) when applied to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\\\\\\\, where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at some point during the transformation (prior to applying \\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)), a modification is introduced such as changing the variable (e.g., substituting \\\\( s \\\\) with \\\\( s + a \\\\) in the transformed equation), will the final solution reflect only the original constants \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) of the ODE?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention such as modifying the transformed equation's variable alters the final solution once the Inverse Laplace Transform is applied. This modification changes the characteristics of the solution, reflecting the intervention's effect (variable change) along with characteristics determined by the original constants \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\).",
