  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant real number, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) the initial complex value. We are interested in studying the effect of applying the linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant real number.\n\nCan one infer the exact initial value \\\\(z_0\\\\) after observing the system at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If unaware of the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), recovering \\\\(z_0\\\\) purely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is ambiguous as both \\\\(e^{iAT}z_0\\\\) and \\\\(e^{(iA+B)T}z_0\\\\) are possible starting evolutions, differing by the unknown factor \\\\(e^{BT}\\\\).",
