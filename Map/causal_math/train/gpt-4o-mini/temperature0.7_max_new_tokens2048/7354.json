  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-dependent system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. An integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) after observing the transformation \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) at time T without knowing intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity and time-invariance of the PDE, and that the Fourier transform is invertible, we can apply the inverse transformation to \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) to retrieve \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) and solve the PDE backwards to find \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",
