  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We are exploring the impact of performing a Fourier transform on this function over time and analyzing the behavior with subsequent Laplace transforms.\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform result, can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at any specific time t without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform result uniquely characterizes the frequency content of the function. Given this frequency-content information, which points to a single frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) can be uniquely determined.",
