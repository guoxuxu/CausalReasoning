  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the impact of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) applied at t = 0, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially, and since the transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) may change the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), it's impossible to confidently backtrack and uniquely deduce the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
