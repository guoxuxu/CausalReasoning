  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{1}{L}q = 0 \\), where \\( q(t) \\) is the charge, \\( R \\) is the resistance, and \\( L \\) is the inductance. Let's analyze the effect of introducing a sinusoidal voltage source \\( V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\) and its impact on the steady-state solution of the system.\n\nIf at a midway time point \\( t_1 \\), we introduce an additional damping factor \\( \\lambda \\) that affects the resistance, \\( R \\rightarrow R + \\lambda \\), will the steady-state of \\( q(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on the updated resistance?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with an additional damping factor \\( \\lambda \\) changes the characteristics of resistance, but the steady-state response continues to be a function of both the damped resistance and the parameters of the voltage source \\( V_0 \\) and \\( \\omega \\). Thus, the updated steady-state depends on multiple factors including the original system properties and the intervention.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The sinusoidal voltage source V(t) directly influences the charge q(t). The resistance R affects the charge q(t), and the inductance L also influences q(t). An increase in the damping factor λ leads to an increase in resistance R, which subsequently affects the charge q(t). Therefore, the updated resistance R + λ will influence the steady-state charge q(t) after time t1.",
