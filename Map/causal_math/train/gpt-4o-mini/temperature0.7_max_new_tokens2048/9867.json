  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). We investigate whether the application of a Fourier transform affects the interpretation or evolution of the function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation, specifically an inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, and then the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed at a later time T, will the observation depend solely on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an inverse Fourier transform mid-evolution introduces a shift back to the time domain, but the previous application of the Fourier transform followed by its inverse can introduce phase shifts or other changes not accounted for solely by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). These transformations alter how the function returns to and behaves in the time domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the function z(t) over time t influences its derivative \\dot{z}. The derivative \\dot{z} directly affects the observation of z(t) at a later time T. The application of an inverse Fourier transform modifies the function z(t), which in turn impacts the observation at T. Therefore, the observation at T depends on both the differential equation governing z(t) and the transformation applied.",
