  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of complex transformations applied to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) in the complex plane, described by \\\\(h_1(z) = e^{Az}h(z)\\\\) initially and then \\\\(h_2(z) = e^{Bz}h_1(z)\\\\) after some time T, where A and B are complex constants.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(h_3(z) = e^{Cz}h_2(z)\\\\) is applied at time t > T as an intervention, will the resulting function \\\\(h_3(T)\\\\) now depend only on the sum of A, B, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation behaves similarly to the previous transformations, where the influences of A, B, and C in the exponent sum linearly due to the properties of exponentiation in the complex plane, resulting in a combined transformation effect exp((A + B + C)T).",
