  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a diagonal matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), will the resultant state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be affected solely by M and not by the initial application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) to the state vector modifies the initial condition, affecting how the solution evolves according to \\\\( M \\\\). Since \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) influences the starting point, it indirectly affects the trajectory and final state at time T.",
