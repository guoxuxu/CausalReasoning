  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real number. To analyze causal effects, we introduce interventions using the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the system with \\\\(h(z) = e^{Dt}z\\\\) where \\\\(D\\\\) is another complex number, will the state at \\\\(t = T\\\\), \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), depend solely on \\\\(\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(C\\\\) or \\\\(D\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The later intervention introduces an additional complex exponential, \\\\(h(z)\\\\), complicating the system further. As such, the eventual state at \\\\(T\\\\) depends not only on the original parameter \\\\(\\omega\\\\) but also significantly on both \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\). The compounded effect of these transformations makes the end state a function of all parameters.",
