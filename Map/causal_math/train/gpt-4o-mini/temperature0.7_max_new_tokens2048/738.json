  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( t \\\\) is real time parameter. Assess how the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), influences the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and interpret the causal relationships.\n\nUsing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), can one uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all \\\\( t \\\\) without any further information or manipulation?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, the Fourier transform is a bijective operation for the class of functions described, allowing the recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). This is due to the properties of the Fourier transform which can uniquely describe frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
