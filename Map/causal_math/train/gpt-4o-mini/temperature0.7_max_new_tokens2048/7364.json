  "Problem": "Imagine we are studying a linear system of differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant coefficient matrix. To examine the behavior under different transformations, we introduce the function \\\\( g(x) = x^T Qx \\\\), a quadratic form where Q is a symmetric constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after unknown interventions at unknown times, can we determine precisely which transformation, \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple paths can converge to the same endpoint under different transformations due to the linearity of the system and the variety of effects introduced by the quadratic and linear transformations. Without specific knowledge of the interventions (both type and timing), identifying what was used uniquely is uncertain.",
