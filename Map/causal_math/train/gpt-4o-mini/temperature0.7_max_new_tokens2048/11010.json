  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We study the effect of this transformation on the integral paths in the complex plane, specifically focusing on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) represents a path in the complex plane.\n\nBased on the integral output \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), can one deduce the exact original path \\\\( C \\\\) if only the integral value is known?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple paths might result in the same integral value due to the properties of the complex exponential function over different paths. The integral value alone is insufficient to uniquely identify the original path without additional information.",
