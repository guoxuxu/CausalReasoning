  "Problem": "Considering a signal processing scenario where a continuous-time signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), and then a filter characterized by a function \\( H(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\).\n\nGiven the output signal \\( y(t) \\), can we infer the exact form of the input signal \\( x(t) \\) if we know \\( H(f) \\) without any additional information on how \\( x(t) \\) was processed before the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\( x(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\) depends critically on the properties of \\( H(f) \\). If \\( H(f) \\) is not invertible, or has zeros in its frequency response, some information about \\( x(t) \\) may be irretrievably lost during filtering, making exact recovery impossible.",
