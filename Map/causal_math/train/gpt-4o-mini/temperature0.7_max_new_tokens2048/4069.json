  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iw_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( w_0 \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time. This function is subject to transformations by applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\).\n\nIf the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some initial time and the system evolves naturally under the same function without further intervention, will the resulting function at time T still be represented as \\\\( z(T) = e^{iw_0 T} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) changes the initial function configuration by transforming it according to the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\). This transformation generally modulates or alters the frequency components of the original function, leading to a different form at time T.",
