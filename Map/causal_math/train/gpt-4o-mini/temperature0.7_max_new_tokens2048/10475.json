  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the set of complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\), and let's consider an integral transformation of this function, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf after applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) an additional complex function \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number) is applied, and then the Fourier transform is taken, will the outcome depend only on the original application of \\\\( f \\\\) and not on \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\) introduces a shift that alters the transform's result due to the properties of the Fourier transform, particularly the shift theorem, demonstrating dependence on both applications.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the function f(z) = z^2 to z results in f(z), which is then transformed into the function g(z) = z + c. The Fourier transform of g(z) depends on both g(z) and the original function f(z), as g(z) is derived from f(z) and the constant c. Additionally, the Fourier transform of f(z) is influenced by its original formulation, indicating that the outcome of the Fourier transform does not depend solely on f(z) but is also affected by the transformation through g(z).",
