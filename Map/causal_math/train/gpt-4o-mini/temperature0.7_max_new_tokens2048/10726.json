  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( t \\) represents time. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation defined by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) as \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\), can we unequivocally determine that the original function was \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) without prior information about the form of \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function in the Fourier transform result specifically at \\( \\omega \\) directly points to the original function being \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). This is a unique characteristic of the Fourier transform of a pure exponential function at a specific frequency.",
