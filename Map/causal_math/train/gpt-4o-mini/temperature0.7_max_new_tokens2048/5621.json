  "Problem": "Consider a magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} = B_0 e^{-kt} \\\\hat{z} \\\\), acting on a charged particle resulting in the Lorentz force equation \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\vec{v}} = q (\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}) \\\\). We explore the effects of an applied electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} = E_0 \\\\hat{x} \\\\) as a transformation on the particle's motion.\n\nIf the electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\) is applied to a particle initially at rest, and then allowed to move under the influence of the magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} \\\\) without further intervention, will the particle's trajectory at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if moved only due to \\\\( \\\\vec{B} \\\\) without \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\) alters the initial velocity vector, which in turn affects how the Lorentz force directs the particle's path. The presence of an electric component introduces additional acceleration along the x-axis, modulating the trajectory compared to the magnetic field only condition.",
