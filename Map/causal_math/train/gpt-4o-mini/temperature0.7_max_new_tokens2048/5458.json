  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function over time domain t.\n\nAfter applying the Laplace transform and observing the s-domain function, can we deduce the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any prior knowledge about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the transformed function in the s-domain clearly indicates the original frequency as the imaginary part of the pole. Since the pole is at \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\), we can directly infer \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
