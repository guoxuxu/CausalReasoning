  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t represents time. We investigate the influence of a Fourier transformation on this function, represented as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) over the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf a time-dependent phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\) is introduced to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transformation, will the spectrum \\\\( F(z) \\\\) show deviation from \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a time-dependent phase shift modifies the underlying function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi(t))} \\\\), potentially altering the frequency content by shifting energy to other frequencies based on the behavior of \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\). This deviation reflects the additional time-dependent dynamics introduced into the system.",
