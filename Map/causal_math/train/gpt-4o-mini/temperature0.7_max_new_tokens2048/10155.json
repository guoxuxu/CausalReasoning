  "Problem": "Let's consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time in the complex plane. We investigate the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time.\n\nIf a function \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state at time \\\\( T \\\\) (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend only on the original transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\) further modifies the dynamics initiated by \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\). The system's behavior, therefore, becomes a result of both transformations, leading to \\\\( z(T) = (e^{it_1})^6 \\\\cdot e^{i(T-t_1)} \\\\) if applied in sequence. Hence, the endpoint depends on both transformations.",
