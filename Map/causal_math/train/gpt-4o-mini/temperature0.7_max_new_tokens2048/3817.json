  "Problem": "Analyze a system given by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\), and consider the effect of applying a boundary condition transformation represented by \\\\( u = h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a harmonic function.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is specified on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\) without any further intervention, will the solution inside \\\\( D \\\\) at a later time T be determined solely by \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution of the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in domain \\\\( D \\\\) under given boundary conditions is uniquely determined by those boundary conditions. With the uniqueness theorem in harmonic functions, specifying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\) sets the solution throughout the domain uniquely for all time as the system is time-invariant.",
