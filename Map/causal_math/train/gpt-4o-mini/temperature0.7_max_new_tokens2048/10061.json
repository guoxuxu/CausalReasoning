  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation, simplified to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\nu\\\\nabla^2u\\\\), where u is the velocity field, p is pressure, and ν is viscosity. Evaluate the behavior under a Fourier transform of the velocity field, represented as \\\\( F(u)(k) \\\\), where k is the wave number.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u)(k) \\\\) is applied to the initial velocity field \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at time t = 0, and then the field evolves according to the Navier-Stokes equation without further intervention, will the transformed field \\\\( F(u)(k, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The dynamics induced by the Navier-Stokes equation alter the velocity field in a non-linear manner, greatly affected by initial conditions and viscosity. The Fourier transform of the evolved field will not necessarily coincide with the evolution under the Fourier transform of the initial conditions due to these non-linear transformations.",
