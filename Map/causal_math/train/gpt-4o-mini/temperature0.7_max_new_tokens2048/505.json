  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, under the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\). The transformation is considered at two intervals: initially at time t = 0 and after applying an intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 and then let the function evolve with time, does the frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remain centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) at any later time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a frequency spectrum that is a delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\). As \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time, the frequency remains constant at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and thus the spectrum remains unchanged without any intervention.",
