  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate changes in the function given by the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\), applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final transformation in the Laplace domain for times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only reflect the change in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not the initial value?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\), thus changing the entire function to \\\\( e^{i(\\omega+\\delta)t} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\). This subsequently changes the transformed function to \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{e^{-(s - i(\\omega + \\delta))t_1}}{s - i(\\omega + \\delta)} \\\\), showing dependencies on both the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the modified \\\\( \\delta \\\\).",
