  "Problem": "Let's examine a complex function scenario given by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces a unit circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We are interested in the effect of a transformation using another function, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied to this time-varying function.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = z(0) \\\\) initially and then evolved under the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further application of \\\\( h \\\\), does the resulting path follow the same trajectory as \\\\( z(t) \\\\) squared for all t?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the trajectory from a unit circle to a path described by \\\\( e^{2it} \\\\). This represents a circle in the complex plane but at twice the angular velocity, hence diverging from the simple square of the original path over time.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The time variable t causes the function z(t) to trace a unit circle, which in turn leads to the initial value z_0. The initial value z_0 is transformed by the function h(z), and the resulting function z(t) evolves independently of h(z) thereafter. The transformation h(z) causes the resulting path to differ from the trajectory of z(t) squared for all t.",
