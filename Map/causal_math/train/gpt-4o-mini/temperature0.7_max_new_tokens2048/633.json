  "Problem": "Consider the calculation of the inverse Laplace transform of a function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\\\) which can describe a physical system's response. Further, analyze the effect of altering the Laplace domain equation by introducing a convolution with another function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nDoes directly performing the inverse Laplace transform on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without modifying the original function result in a response equivalent to the time-domain representation of unaltered system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Performing the inverse Laplace transform on \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\\\) without modifications directly results in its time-domain counterpart, which correctly represents the system's response based solely on its defined parameters.",
