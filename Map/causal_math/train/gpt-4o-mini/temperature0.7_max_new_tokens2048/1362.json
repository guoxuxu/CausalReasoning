  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a change in the variable s defined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(t) = t^ke^{At} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and A is a non-zero constant.\n\nIf we observe the transformation output \\\\( I(s) \\\\), can we determine whether the original function was \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{(A+s)t} \\\\) without knowing the value of k?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the output \\\\( I(s) \\\\) alone is insufficient to backtrack uniquely to either \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{(A+s)t} \\\\), especially without information on k. Both alterations in the exponential term and the power of t can significantly shift the function, thereby confusing the original form analysis.",
