  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions. The transformation involves the application of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by adding an additional harmonic component, and then the Fourier transform is taken, will the resulting frequency spectrum reflect only the original components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding a harmonic component alters the signal, hence the Fourier transform post-intervention will include the frequencies of both the original signal and the newly added component, thereby reflecting the cumulative effect of all components present.",
