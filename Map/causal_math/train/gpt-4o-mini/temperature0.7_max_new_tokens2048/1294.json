  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nGiven the function \\( v(t) \\) at t = T, can we deduce precisely what the original function u(x) was at t = 0 without knowing if the Fourier transform was used?",
  "Explanation": "Even if it is known that L has operated on \\( u(x) \\), without confirmation if a Fourier transform or some other transformation was applied, reversing to the exact state of \\( u(x) \\) at t = 0 is highly uncertain. The changes induced by L and potential lack of information about initial Fourier transform application introduce significant ambiguity.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The linear operator L acts on function u to yield Lu, while Lu influences the function v(t) at time T. The function v(t) is causally linked back to the original function u(x), and u(x) is further connected to its second derivative u''(x). Additionally, the Fourier transform interacts with both u(x) and Lu.",
