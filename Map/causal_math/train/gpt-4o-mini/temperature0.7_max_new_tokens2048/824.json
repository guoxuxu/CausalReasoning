  "Problem": "Consider a function represented as a complex map \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a constant complex number. This map is used iteratively from an initial point z_0 in the complex plane to study its dynamic evolution.\n\nCan we precisely determine the time of intervention \\\\( t_k \\\\), knowing only the final state of the sequence after many iterations?",
  "Explanation": "The complex dynamics influenced by switching functions and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions make it challenging to back-calculate the exact moment of intervention \\\\( t_k \\\\) solely from the final state of the sequence.",
