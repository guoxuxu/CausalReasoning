  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping from the complex plane to itself given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{az+b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate the effects of this transformation under the integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be deduced from the integral \\\\( \\int_C e^{az+b} f(z) \\, dz \\\\) if the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), reversibly identifying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from the integral where \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is scaled and shifted by \\\\( e^{az+b} \\\\) is indeterminate. Parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) affect the exponentiation, making exact recovery of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from the integral uncertain.",
