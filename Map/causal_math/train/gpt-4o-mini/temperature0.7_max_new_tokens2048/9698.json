  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform on a function representing vector components \\\\( v(t) \\), where \\\\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\\\).\n\nFrom the frequency composition of \\\\( v(T) \\\\) at time T, can we reconstruct the vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing that a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) on the frequency components of \\\\( v_0 \\\\) complicates back-calculating to \\\\( v_0 \\\\). Without knowing the initial application of the Fourier transform, such reconstruction might miss or misinterpret the original basis represented by \\\\( v_0 \\\\).",
