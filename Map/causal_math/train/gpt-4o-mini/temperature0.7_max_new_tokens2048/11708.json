  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + B\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + D\\\\), respectively. We investigate the behavior under the integral transform \\\\(T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nKnowing only \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at the end time T, can we deduce the exact details of the interventions (values of F, G, H, I) or even ascertain if any change was made in the differential equations of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-inversibility of the integral transform which mixes the influences over time, and the lack of unique resolution of differential contribution from T[z](t) alone, it is hard to back-calculate and identify the specifics or even the existence of the interventions without additional information about the trajectories of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\).",
