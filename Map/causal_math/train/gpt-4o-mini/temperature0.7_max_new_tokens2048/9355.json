  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent complex function \\\\( f(z, t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( Tg(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iBs}g(z) ds \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( Tz(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on B and not on A or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( Tz(T) \\\\) dependent on A, B, and C. The interactions between these exponential transformations can significantly alter the trajectory and the result.",
