  "Problem": "Considering a complex function and its transformation by a linear operator, let \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) be a time-dependent complex function. The linear operator \\( L \\) acts on \\( z \\) such that \\( L(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing the resultant function at time \\( T \\), can we deduce the original function \\( z(0) \\) without knowing if the operator \\( L \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\( L \\) alters the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) by convolution with the exponential term, without explicit knowledge of the operator's application, recovering the initial state \\( z(0) \\) uniquely from \\( z(T) \\) is not possible due to the irreversible integration process.",
