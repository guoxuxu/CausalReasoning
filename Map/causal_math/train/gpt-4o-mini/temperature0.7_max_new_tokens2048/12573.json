  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\Delta u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a complex function of a spatial variable. We investigate how the application of Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\), impacts the causal inference of effects in this system.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at the initial state be uniquely determined from its evolved state under only its Laplace equation transformation, after applying \\\\(\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace equation is linear and the Fourier Transform is an invertible linear operator, the transformed and evolved state can be uniquely inverted back to the original state \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at the initial time.",
