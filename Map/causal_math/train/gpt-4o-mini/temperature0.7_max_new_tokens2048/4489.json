  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\), aiming to analyze the consequences of employing a time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t) \\) where \\( \\\\alpha \\) is a scaling factor.\n\nDoes applying the time-scaling operation \\(g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t)\\) to a function and then computing its Laplace Transform change the result compared to directly computing the transform of \\(f(t)\\) under normal conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The time-scaling operation modifies the function which results in a different Laplace Transform, specifically \\( L(g)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}L(f)(\\\\frac{s}{\\\\alpha}) \\). This change clearly indicates that the outputs will not be the same.",
