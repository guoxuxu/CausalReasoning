  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanical system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a time-independent Hamiltonian H. We study the effect of applying a linear operator \\\\( U = e^{-iHt} \\\\) on the state vector at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( U \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve under the Schrödinger equation without any further intervention, will the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the Schrödinger equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U \\\\) at t = 0 effectively prepares the state vector in the same form as it would evolve naturally under the Schrödinger equation. Since \\\\( U \\\\) is essentially the time-evolution operator for the Hamiltonian H, the evolution is coherent and maintains the system in an equivalent state at time T.",
