  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant voltage source V and a linear resistor R in series with a capacitor C. The charge Q on the capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\\\frac{V - Q/C}{R}\\\\). We study the impact of applying a sinusoidal function \\\\(f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) as an external forcing term to the circuit.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is applied to the circuit at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\(Q(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if no external forcing term was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the external forcing term \\\\(f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) modifies the differential equation governing the charge Q. This results in a different solution for Q(t), potentially causing oscillatory behavior that would not occur without the forcing term.",
