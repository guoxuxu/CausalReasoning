  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\. The function undergoes a Fourier transform, yielding the function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf an additional sinusoidal function of a different frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_2 \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the combined function is then Fourier transformed, will the resulting \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega_2 \\\\) depend only on the new frequency introduced, and not on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new frequency component modifies the overall spectrum, resulting in additional components in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) corresponding to both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_2 \\\\). The presence of multiple frequencies can also lead to interference patterns or additional spectral artifacts, thus the resulting spectrum depends on both.",
