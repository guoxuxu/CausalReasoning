  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), commonly referred to as the heat equation. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) = U(k, t) \\\\), is applied to the system.\n\nIf an intervention by applying an additional variable conductivity modeled by \\\\( k(x) \\\\) occurs at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transform \\\\( U(k, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original diffusion equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention altered the basic heat equation by introducing spatially dependent conductivity, resulting in a non-uniform diffusion process. This change does not merely shift or scale the solution but potentially alters it in fundamentally different ways that cannot be derived solely from the original heat dynamics.",
