  "Problem": "Investigate a linear system governed by \\\\( dX = NX dt + M dW_t \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Wiener process (Brownian motion). We hypothesize a transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Kt} X \\\\) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) being another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is left to evolve according to \\\\( dX = NX dt + M dW_t \\\\) with no further intervention, will the state \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to direct evolution from \\\\( X_0 \\\\) to \\\\( X(T) \\\\) under the given system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Kt}X \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by scaling and rotating the state vector, depending on \\\\( K \\\\). This initial change affects how the system evolves under the stochastic differential equation, particularly impacting how the noise term \\\\( dW_t \\\\) influences the state vector due to the different scaling.",
