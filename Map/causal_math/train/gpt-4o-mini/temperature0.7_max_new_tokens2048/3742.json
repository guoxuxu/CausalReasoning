  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z \\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by observing the system at time T and knowing the matrices A and B, assuming no transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature of the differential equations and absence of any transformation, observing the system at T allows for a straightforward calculation backward using the inverses of the matrix exponentials \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
