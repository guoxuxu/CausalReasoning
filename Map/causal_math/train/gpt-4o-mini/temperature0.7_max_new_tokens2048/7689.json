  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subjected to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant complex number. Analyze how the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\) affects z over time t, where \\\\( U \\\\) is also a constant complex number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling it with \\\\( e^{Ut} \\\\), thus changing the trajectory. Since the trajectories depend exponentially on the time t and the constants \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), they will not end up the same unless \\\\( U = 0 \\\\).",
