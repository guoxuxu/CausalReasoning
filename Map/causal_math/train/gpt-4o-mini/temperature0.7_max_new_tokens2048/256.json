  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transformation of a real-valued function \\(\\psi(t)\\) defined as \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\). We explore the impact of a linear differential operator \\(L = d/dt + a\\), where \\(a\\) is a constant, applied to \\(\\psi(t)\\).\n\nCan we determine which intervention (\\(\\phi(t)\\) or \\(L\\psi(t)\\)) was applied just by analyzing \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega)\\) at some later time \\(T\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity introduced by the exponential modification in \\(\\phi(t)\\) and the action of \\(L\\) on \\(\\psi(t)\\), the resulting Fourier transform \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega)\\) could potentially correspond to multiple combinations of functions and operators. This leads to ambiguity in identifying specific interventions from the final transformed state alone.",
