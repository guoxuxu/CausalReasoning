  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) at t = 0 and subsequently evolves according to the given partial differential equation, will the Fourier transform at time t = T, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), be equivalent to directly applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier Transform of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) evolving under the given PDE is \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\), the transformation commutes with the time evolution under this PDE. This ensures that applying the Fourier Transform to the evolved state at any time t = T yields the same result as evolving the transformed initial state.",
