  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) with variable \\\\(t\\\\) representing time. We study the effects of a transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) and explore causal relationships and interventions in the temporal evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = z(0) = 1\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) initially squares the value at \\\\(t = 0\\\\). This changes the initial condition before natural evolution according to \\\\(e^{it}\\\\), resulting in an altered trajectory where the squaring effect doubles the frequency to \\\\(e^{2it}\\\\). The system thus evolves differently compared to if no transformation were applied.",
