  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is an input function. We study how manipulations through a specific function \\\\( g(x) = x + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, influence the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an input function \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) initially, and then \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the integral transformation, will the outcome at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) under the integral transformation without applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) alters the initial input to \\\\( x_0(s) + c \\\\), hence modifying the integral to \\\\( \\\\int_{0}^{T} K(T, s) (x_0(s) + c) ds \\\\) which results in an additional constant term \\( c \\\\int_0^T K(T, s) ds \\) compared to the original outcome. This constant adds a shift to all values, affecting the output value at time T.",
