  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) x(t) \\\\). The signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nUpon observing the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both) were applied throughout the evolution, based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) could result from a variety of transformation combinations and timings. Without detailed historical information on when and which transformations were applied, the signal's path cannot be uniquely retraced to identify the specific interventions. The transformations' effects might overlap and interfere, obscuring their individual impact.",
