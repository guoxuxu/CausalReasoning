  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the complex variable. Determine how transformations by function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) at specific instances influence the behavior of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) over the complex plane.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at z = 0 modify the evolution of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) under its inherent dynamics as z moves away from the origin?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at z = 0 changes the function to \\\\( e^{Bz}e^{Az} \\\\) which is generally not the same as \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) unless A and B commute. Hence, the trajectory of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) on the complex plane is altered from the original by this initial transformation.",
