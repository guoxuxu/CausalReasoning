  "Problem": "We investigate a signal processing system characterized by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system governed by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = h(t) * x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system’s impulse response and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied to the signal defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to modify the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by a scaling function \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), will this intervention affect the final transformed output \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\) assuming the initial input was \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the impulse response, consequently changing the system's characteristics. This alteration affects the convolution \\\\( y(t) = (h(t) * e^{\\\\beta t}) * x(t) \\\\), thereby impacting the frequency components and resulting in a different Fourier transform of the output. The effect on \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\) can be attributed directly to the changes in \\\\( h(t) \\\\) implemented by the intervention.",
