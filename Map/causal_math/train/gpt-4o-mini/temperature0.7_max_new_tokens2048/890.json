  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables. We study the function transformation by the integral kernel \\\\( K(s, t) = e^{-st} \\\\) under operation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(s,t) f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed function at time T, can we accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(t) = t + it^2 \\\\) without the original function form?",
  "Explanation": "The irreversible nature of the integration under the exponential kernel means information about the exact power of t in the original function could be lost, and multiple original functions could yield similar transformed outputs.",
