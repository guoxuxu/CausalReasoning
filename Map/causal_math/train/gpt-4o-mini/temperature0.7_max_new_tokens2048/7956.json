  "Problem": "Analyze causal inference in a system represented by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\lambda \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the system's state and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant speed. Additionally, consider the transformation \\\\( g(u) = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we accurately determine the interventions applied (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both), only based on \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were applied is challenging because different combinations of L and M can lead to equivalent state configurations at t=T. Moreover, the effects of L and M may not be distinguishable purely from the endpoint due to their linear nature and the way they modify state propagation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
