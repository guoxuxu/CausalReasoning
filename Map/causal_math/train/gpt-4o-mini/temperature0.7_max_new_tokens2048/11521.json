  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. We examine the effect of applying the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), on this function over the variable 's', a complex number.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) is computed for a given function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be solely dependent on the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without external influences?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) is a linear operator that directly depends on the form and characteristics of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Outside interventions or changes to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself do not occur in this process, making \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) solely dependent on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
