  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(x) \\) defined in the complex plane and a contour integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is a closed path in the complex domain. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation \\( T(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) to the function before integrating.\n\nGiven the integral result \\( \\int_{\\gamma} T(z(x)) \\, dx \\), can we determine \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\) without knowing \\( z(x) \\) or \\( \\gamma \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T \\) alters the original function \\( z \\) in such a way that getting the integral of \\( z \\) from the transformed integral result cannot uniquely determine the original integral due to potential changes in properties like residues and poles inside \\( \\gamma \\).",
