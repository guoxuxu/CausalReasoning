  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the linear transformation \\\\( T: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) and let \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex vector. A transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is known to be applied, where B is also a constant matrix. The behavior of the system under this transformation over time t is studied.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge about the influence of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is crucial as the transformation \\\\( e^{BT}z_0 \\\\) employed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could alter the state in ways that are not reversible or deducible from the state at T alone, especially if the matrices A and B do not commute.",
