  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane dynamics described by the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ u(t) \\} = U(s) \\) of a temporal function \\( u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\). We study the effect of a convolution operator defined by \\( h(t) \\) over the signal \\( u(t) \\), resulting in \\( v(t) = (h * u)(t) \\).\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a filtering by \\( g(t) \\) (where its Laplace transform is \\( G(s) \\)) is applied to \\( v(t) \\), resulting in \\( w(t) = (g * v)(t) \\), will \\( W(s) \\) at a later time depend only on \\( V(s) \\) and not \\( G(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\( g(t) \\) introduces another convolution, and hence, in the Laplace domain, \\( W(s) = G(s)V(s) = G(s)H(s)U(s) \\), which indeed depends on \\( G(s) \\), \\( H(s) \\), and \\( U(s) \\).",
