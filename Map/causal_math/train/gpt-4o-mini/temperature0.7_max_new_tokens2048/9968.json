  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We assess the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function, given by the integral \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iwx} e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), analyzing both the direct transformation and its inversion.\n\nKnowing only the transformed result \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - (w + q)) \\\\), can we accurately trace back and distinguish whether the original function was transformed or phase-shifted?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform result of a shifted delta function does not specify whether the shift was due to an original different frequency in \\\\( z(x) \\\\) or a subsequent phase-shift operation. Both scenarios yield indistinguishable transformations in this setup, demonstrating an inability to differentiate past operations based solely on the final transform.",
