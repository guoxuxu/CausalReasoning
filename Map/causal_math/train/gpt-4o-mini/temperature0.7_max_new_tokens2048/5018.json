  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\), in a region where the potential \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is influenced by the boundary conditions. Investigate the effects of perturbing the boundary condition with an additional complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the potential \\\\( \\\\phi(z, t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was initially applied, in the absence of any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the original or other possible boundary conditions and considering the solutions of Laplace equation are not unique without boundary conditions, one cannot uniquely determine whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied.",
