  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the integration transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'} z(t') \\\\, dt' \\\\) with constant matrix C over time t, and how this affects system behavior.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about the application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and its integrating effect with the matrix C obscures the ability to recover the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the trajectory may have been altered significantly.",
