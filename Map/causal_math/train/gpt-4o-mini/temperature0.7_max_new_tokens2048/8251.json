  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The scenario investigates how the function's behavior changes under various transformations, particularly a transformation applied by an integral operator \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(Tf(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\alpha s} f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a fixed real constant.\n\nIf an additional linear transformation \\\\( Lz(t) = e^{-i\\\\beta t}z(t) \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is constant) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the resultant state at time \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) only depend on the immediate past state without considering historical transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(Lz(t)\\\\) introduces additional dynamics to the system that are dependent not only on the state of the system at \\\\(t_1\\\\) but also significantly on the parameters of prior transformations (\\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)). The system's past influences, including the integral transformation, directly impact the future state even after the intervention.",
