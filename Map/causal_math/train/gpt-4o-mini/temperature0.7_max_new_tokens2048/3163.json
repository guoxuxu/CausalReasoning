  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution along a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where k is a positive constant. We examine the effects of introducing a boundary condition modified at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\) over time t, such as \\\\( u(0,t) = u(0,t)e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf a new boundary condition \\\\( u(L,t) = u(L,t)e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where L is the length of the rod) is introduced at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the endpoint temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the heat conduction coefficient k and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new boundary condition at \\\\( x = L \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), as well as the conduction coefficient k. The boundary conditions at both ends can significantly influence the temperature distribution along the rod.",
