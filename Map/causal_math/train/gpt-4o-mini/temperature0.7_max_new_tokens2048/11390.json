  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The integral transformation maps the time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at different complex values of \\\\( s \\\\) is of interest.\n\nWith the observed function \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse transformation from \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is not unique without extra constraints or information. Different functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can result in the same transformed function, particularly if incomplete or imperfect information about \\\\( s \\\\) exists.",
