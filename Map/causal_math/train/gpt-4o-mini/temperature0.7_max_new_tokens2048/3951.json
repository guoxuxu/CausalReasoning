  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying a Laplace Transform L on a function g(t), where g(t) = e^(At)x for a constant matrix A and an initial vector x.\n\nIf another linear operator M is applied to x before forming g(t) such that ŷ(t) = e^(At)Mx and then performing L{ŷ(t)}, will L{ŷ(t)} still equal (sI - A)^-1 * x?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation M to x alters the initial conditions forming ŷ(t) = e^(At)Mx. Subsequent application of the Laplace Transform on ŷ(t) leads to L{ŷ(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * Mx, which differs from L{g(t)} because of the inclusion of M, hence affecting the outcome of the transformation.",
