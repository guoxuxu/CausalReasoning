  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), and an external heat source function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) is introduced that affects the temperature. The impact of heat source transformation defined by \\\\( u(x,t) = u(x,t) + h(x,t) \\\\) on temperature distribution is analyzed.\n\nIf the heat source function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) is introduced to the system initially and no further modifications are made, will the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at T be the same as if the source \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) was not introduced at all?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the heat source function modifies the initial heating conditions and directly influences the temperature distribution over time, differentiating \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) from the scenario where \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) was not applied.",
