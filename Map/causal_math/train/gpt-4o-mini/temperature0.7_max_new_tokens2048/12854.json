  "Problem": "Consider a chemical reaction where the concentration of a substance \\\\( C(t) \\\\) evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dC}{dt} = kC \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a reaction rate constant. We analyze how applying a transformation \\\\( f(C) = e^{-kt}C \\\\) affects the system over time.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(C) = e^{lt}C \\\\) (where \\\\( l \\\\) is a different constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the concentration \\\\( C(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on k and not on l?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(C) = e^{lt}C \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the trajectory of the concentration, making it dependent both on \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( l \\\\). The intervention modifies the concentration by multiplying it by \\\\( e^{lt} \\\\), thereby changing the dynamics and the final concentration at time T.",
