  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) and that an intervention \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) was applied, can we deduce the exact form of \\\\( v \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) provides limited information due to its transformation nature, and various forms of \\\\( v \\\\) can lead to similar effects in the frequency domain, especially without knowing additional specifics about the system's response to different types of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The function u(x,t) evolves over time according to the differential operator L, which affects the rate of change of u with respect to time. This rate of change leads to the state of u at a specific time T. The state of u at time T is influenced by the intervention v applied at an earlier time. The Fourier transform of this state allows us to analyze the effects of v, thereby enabling the deduction of its exact form.",
