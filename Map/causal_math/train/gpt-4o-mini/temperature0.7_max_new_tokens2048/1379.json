  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation matrix T, where \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) changes the basis of the solution and subsequently applying the inverse transformation \\\\( T^{-1}y = x \\\\).\n\nIf the system is intervened by applying an additional transformation \\\\( U \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), such that \\\\( Ux = z \\\\), and then transforming back using \\\\( U^{-1}z = x \\\\) at time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x \\\\) necessarily satisfy \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) regardless of the specifics of U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( U^{-1} \\\\) affects the trajectory and may alter the condition under which \\\\( x \\\\) solves \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). The change in basis may not preserve the particular solution due to properties of the transformation matrices.",
