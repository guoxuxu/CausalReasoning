  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the input signal and \\\\(e^{i\\omega s}\\\\) is a complex exponential function used for frequency analysis. The transformation aims to filter or modify the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nIf an additional modulation \\\\(x(t) = x_0(t) \\cdot e^{i\\eta t}\\\\) is applied to the input signal at a time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), where \\\\(\\eta\\\\) is a constant, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\)'s predominant frequency component still be \\\\(\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the modulation with \\\\(e^{i\\eta t}\\\\) shifts the frequency spectrum of the input signal. Thus, the major component of frequency in \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will now be a summation or difference between \\\\(\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\eta\\\\), rather than just \\\\(\\omega\\\\), thereby affecting the output spectrum at time T.",
