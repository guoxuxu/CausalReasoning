  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) over time t, where J is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\), \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by defining \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as \\\\( e^{Jt}z_0 \\\\) instead of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This alteration causes a deviation in the trajectory of the evolution under the differential equations, resulting in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the non-trivial impact of the complex exponential factor.",
