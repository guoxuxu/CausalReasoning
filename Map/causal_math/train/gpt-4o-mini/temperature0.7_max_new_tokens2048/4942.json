  "Problem": "Investigate the response function R(z) in a complex system, where \\\\( R(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), with complex coefficients a and b. The system's behavior is probed using a transformation \\\\( T(s) = e^{st} \\\\) where s is a complex number and t represents time.\n\nWithout prior knowledge of the parameter s in \\\\( T(s) \\\\), can one determine the exact value of s from observing the evolution of \\\\( R(z) \\\\) at z = e^{st} over time?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the evolution of \\\\( R(e^{st}) \\\\) without the intervention provides information about the time-dependent behavior, but it cannot uniquely determine s because different values of s could result in similar evolution trajectories due to the periodicity and exponential nature of the transformation.",
