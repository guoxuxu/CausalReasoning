  "Problem": "Consider a calculation involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The calculation examines the integral transformation across time t defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\int_0^T z(t) \\, dt \\\\) and impacts of interventions at different stages.\n\nKnowing that the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was zero, can we determine the exact frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) under our original conditions without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "If the integral \\\\( F(z) \\\\) results in zero, this implies full cycles of the sinusoidal function within the interval [0, T], but this does not uniquely identify \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Multiple frequencies (multiples of \\\\( \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\\\)) can satisfy this condition by completing different numbers of full cycles within the same interval.",
