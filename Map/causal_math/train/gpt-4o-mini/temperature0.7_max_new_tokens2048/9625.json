  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = i \\\\Delta u + k u \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) is applied and the system evolves according to its dynamics without further intervention, will the system's state at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be affected solely by the properties of \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the evolution is significantly influenced by the constant \\\\( k \\\\), it is also inherently dependent on the Laplacian operator which affects the diffusion characteristics of the function. Therefore, the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) is dependent not only on \\\\( k \\\\) but also on the spatial distribution and second derivatives through \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\).",
