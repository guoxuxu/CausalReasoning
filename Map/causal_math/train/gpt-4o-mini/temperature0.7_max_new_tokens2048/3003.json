  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is determined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. The transformations used are \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and an external force represented by \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or the application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the external force \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) introduces a dependency on \\\\( h(t) \\\\), affecting the system's motion from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\). Furthermore, the earlier application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state, contributing additional complexity to the system’s behavior thereby making \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\).",
