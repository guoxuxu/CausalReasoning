  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a transformation via a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) on a complex plane where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. Consider the system's change over time if it is described by the flow \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\\\phi}w \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention at time t = t1, will the state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for T > t1 solely depend on the initial \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "After applying the intervention, the trajectory is affected by both the initial transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\). The system's endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\) depends on the compounded effects of \\\\( \\\\theta, \\\\phi \\\\), and \\\\( k \\\\), altering the natural evolution path defined by \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\).",
