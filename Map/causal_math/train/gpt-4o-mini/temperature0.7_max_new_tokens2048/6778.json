  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) applied to a linear system characterized by \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where \\( D \\) is a constant matrix and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number. The system's evolution is influenced by the Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\), which transforms \\( x(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nConsidering the frequency spectrum \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) at time T, can we determine precisely that \\( z(t) \\) was applied initially without knowing the natural frequencies of the untransformed system?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the spectral properties encrypted in \\( D \\), it's challenging to distinguish whether the frequencies in \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) result solely from the transformation \\( z(t) \\) or from the inherent features of the matrix \\( D \\). The spectrum might contain overlapping or closely linked frequency components making it ambiguous.",
