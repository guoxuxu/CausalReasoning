  "Problem": "Consider a system of equations governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is applied to this system resulting in the transformed function \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what kernels were used (whether \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\), \\\\( K'(t,s) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the function at \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) can result from varying contributions of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) under different kernels due to the integral transformation process. This makes it arduous to uniquely determine the kernel or sequence of kernels used from the endpoint alone.",
