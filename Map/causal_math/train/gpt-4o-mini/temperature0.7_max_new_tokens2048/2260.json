  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where the output at any time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) is a complex function and A is a constant complex matrix. Consider the effect of an external control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( X(t) \\\\) as \\\\( X_u(t) = X(t) + u(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) after control application \\\\( u(t) \\\\), is it feasible to determine the exact external control applied only from \\\\( Z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( Z(T) \\\\), it is not straightforward to trace back and uniquely identify the control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) due to the integration obscuring direct effects and the potential for various controls leading to similar or identical outcomes in combination with the original \\\\( X(t) \\\\).",
