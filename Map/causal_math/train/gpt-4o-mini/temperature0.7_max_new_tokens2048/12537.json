  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), which is applied to an input function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) in a linear system defined by the integral transform \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h(t-u) x(u) du \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response. An additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is considered as an intervention.\n\nIf \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is observed, can we determine the exact form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), reversing the convolution to uniquely identify \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is generally impossible, as multiple impulse-response and input-function combinations can produce the same output.",
