  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant. Let's focus on its behavior under the mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing an angular frequency, and t represents time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) assuming no information about the intervening time evolution is known?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function \\\\( g \\\\) and the mapping \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are both non-linear and the latter involves time-dependent rotation, it’s generally impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of the value of T or \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
