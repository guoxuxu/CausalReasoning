  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) in a complex domain where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are complex variables. Analyze how linear transformations \\\\(T(x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)\\\\) (where \\\\(a, b, c, d\\\\) are constants) affect the function.\n\nGiven the final output, can we determine exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(U\\\\), or both) based solely on the resulting value of \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same final output can result from numerous different combinations of the transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(U\\\\) due to the variable ways these transformations can modify the coordinates. Thus, it's impossible to uniquely identify the interventions from the outcome alone.",
