  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We assess the impact of the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) over time t, where \\( \\alpha \\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( f(z) = e^{\\beta t}z \\) (where \\( \\beta \\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\( \\alpha \\) and depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\beta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( f(z) \\) introduces another modifying factor, making the final state \\( z(T) \\) dependent on \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\beta \\), and \\( \\omega \\). The transformations generated by \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) will have compounded effects, including different rates of growth/decay and rotations, thereby influencing the overall path and obtaining \\( z(T) \\).",
