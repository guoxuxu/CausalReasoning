  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We're studying the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be equal to direct evolution of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at t = 0 doesn't alter the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), because the integral from 0 to 0 vanishes. Hence \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolves identically as it would from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) under \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\).",
