  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\\\overline{z}} \\\\), where A and B are complex constants and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of z. We investigate the impact of a subsequent transformation \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), where C is a non-zero complex constant, applied over the complex plane.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( w(z) = D\\\\cdot v(z) \\\\) (where D is another non-zero complex constant) is applied at a point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), will \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at any point z depend only on the transformations \\\\( u(z) \\\\) and not on the specific values of C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The final function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is affected by both C and D through the compositions of transformations. Hence, the ultimate form of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) depends not only on \\\\( u(z) \\\\) but also critically on the values of C and D, which scale and transform the original function \\\\( u(z) \\\\).",
