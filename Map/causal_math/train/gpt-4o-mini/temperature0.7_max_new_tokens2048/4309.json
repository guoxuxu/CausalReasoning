  "Problem": "Let's examine a continuity equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (vu) = 0\\\\), where v is a fixed velocity field. Consider the Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)(k)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx}u(x) dx\\\\) applied to the function u. We explore how this transformation affects the evolution of u over time.\n\nIf we apply the Fourier transformation to a function u at t = 0 and allow it to evolve according to the continuity equation without further action, will the function u(t) at t = T correspond to the direct evolution of the initial Fourier transform at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transformation converts the differential operation into an algebraic operation, the evolution under the continuity equation transforms into a multiplication by a phase factor, preserving the behavior across the transformed domain. Thus, applying the Fourier transform at the beginning does not change the outcome.",
