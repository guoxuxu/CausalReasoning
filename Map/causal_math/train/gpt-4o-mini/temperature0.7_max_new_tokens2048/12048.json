  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) that represents a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which undergoes a transformation given by the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\). We examine how this transformation affects the causal relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations.\n\nIf the complex function \\( z(t) \\) is transformed into the frequency domain by the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), will the output \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\) uniquely represent the function \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) of \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) uniquely transforms the time-domain function into a frequency-domain representation. The transformation, being linear and injective for such functions, preserves the uniqueness and details of \\( z(t) \\) in the transformed output.",
