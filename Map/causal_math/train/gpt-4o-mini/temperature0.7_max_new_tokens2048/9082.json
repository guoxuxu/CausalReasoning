  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At} x \\), where \\( x \\) is a complex vector and \\( A \\) is a complex square matrix. Evaluate the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another complex matrix, on this function over a period \\( T \\).\n\nGiven \\( I(z) \\) computed up to time \\( T \\), is it possible to uniquely recover \\( x \\) assuming the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are known?",
  "Explanation": "The operation of integrating \\( e^{Bt}z(t) \\) where \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) results in an expression where properties of \\( x \\) could be masked due to the transformations involved. Unless \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have particular, known invertible relationships, \\( x \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( I(z) \\) alone.",
