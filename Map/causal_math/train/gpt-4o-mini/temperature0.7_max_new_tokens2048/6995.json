  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) that transforms a function \\( u(x) \\) using a convolution integral \\( L[u](x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x - t)u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( k \\) is the kernel function. We scrutinize the effects of an initial function \\( u_0(x) \\) and its interaction with different kernels, including potential changes in kernel midway.\n\nIf we alter the kernel function to \\( k_2(x) \\) at an intermediate time \\( t_1 \\), replacing \\( k_1(x) \\), will the final output \\( L[u_0](x) \\) solely depend on the later applied kernel \\( k_2(x) \\) while disregarding the initial effects of \\( k_1(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of \\( k_1(x) \\) on \\( u_0(x) \\) prior to changing to \\( k_2(x) \\) can still persist and influence the system's behavior alongside the new effects introduced by \\( k_2(x) \\). The final state is a complex superposition or interaction of both kernels on the initial function.",
