  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical system where the rotation of a vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\) is defined by a complex function \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant representing angular velocity. The impact of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\), defined as scaling by a factor \\\\(s>0\\\\), is used as an intervention.\n\nKnowing the final position of a vector \\\\(v(T)\\\\) after natural evolution under \\\\(f(t, v)\\\\), can we determine the initial vector \\\\(v_0\\\\) without knowing the rotation angle or the duration \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(T\\\\), the initial vector \\\\(v_0\\\\) cannot be uniquely derived from \\\\(v(T)\\\\) since multiple combinations of these parameters (rotation angle and time) could result in the same final rotated vector.",
