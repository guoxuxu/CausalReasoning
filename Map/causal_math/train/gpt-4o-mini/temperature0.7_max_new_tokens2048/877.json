  "Problem": "Consider the equation governing heat flow in a rod described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(x\\\\) is the position along the rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heating source modifies the temperature according to a function \\\\( f(x, t) = e^{At}sin(x) \\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(x, t) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is left to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the system evolved from an unmodified initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(x, t) \\\\) changes the initial temperature distribution, influencing the subsequent evolution of the system according to the heat equation. The altered initial condition leads to a different temperature profile at any later time, including t = T.",
