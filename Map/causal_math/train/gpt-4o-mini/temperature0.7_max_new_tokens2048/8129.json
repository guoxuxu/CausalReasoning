  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) representing a complex valued function, where \\\\( z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\\\). We analyze the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ h(z) \\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) also belongs to the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is originally a sinusoidal function and undergoes a Laplace transform, will the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) have poles on the imaginary axis?",
  "Explanation": "A sinusoidal function in the time domain, represented as \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega z} \\\\) with \\\\( i \\\\) the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) the frequency, would have its Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ e^{i\\omega z} \\}(s) \\\\) showing poles exactly at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\). This indicates singular points on the imaginary axis, which are essential characteristics of the frequency domain representation of the sinusoid.",
