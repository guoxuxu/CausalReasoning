  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without any additional intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially squares the complex number, changing the trajectory path. The transformation modifies the magnitude and the frequency of oscillation of the trajectory, making it distinct from the unmodified path.",
