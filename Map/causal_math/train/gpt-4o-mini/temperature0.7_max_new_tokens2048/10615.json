  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is a finite upper limit.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was computed with a modified function \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is another frequency, will \\\\( F(z')(T) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( F(z') \\\\) will be affected by both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) due to the addition of the new frequency component \\\\( e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\). This modification alters the integration results significantly, resulting in a dependency on both frequencies.",
