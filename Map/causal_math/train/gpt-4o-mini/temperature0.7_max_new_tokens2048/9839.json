  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\gamma t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) is a real constant different from \\\\( \\omega \\\\)) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the resulting \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) \\\\) only reflect the component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or will it also include \\\\( \\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the modulation \\\\( m(t) \\\\) affects the original function, resulting in \\\\( z(t)m(t) = e^{i(\\omega + \\gamma)t} \\\\). The Fourier transform of this new function yields a delta function at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega + \\gamma \\\\), indicating the cumulative effect of both frequencies.",
