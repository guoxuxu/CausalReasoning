  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the potential function \\\\( V(x) = -\\\\alpha x^2 + \\\\beta x^4 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. Investigate the effects of perturbing the initial position of the particle using a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + \\\\delta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is a small constant, on the system's long-term behavior.\n\nIf the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) of the particle is perturbed by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to become \\\\( x_0 + \\\\delta \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the system dynamics without further intervention, will the trajectory of the particle be the same as if it started from \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The perturbation alters the initial conditions. For nonlinear systems such as this, even small changes in initial conditions can lead to significant divergence in the trajectories over time, due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions typical of systems with nonlinear dynamics.",
