  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, and analyze its behavior under the integral transform \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i \\\\eta \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the result of the integral transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\), can we determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) influences the imaginary part of the transform, but without specific knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\\\), particularly \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\), it's not feasible to uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) since multiple frequencies could yield similar effects depending on the decay rate induced by \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\).",
