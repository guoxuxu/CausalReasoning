  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a two-dimensional space, \\(\\Delta u = 0\\), where \\(u(x,y)\\) is the potential function. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to convert the problem into its frequency domain representation, allowing analytical manipulation by \\(\\mathcal{F}[u](k_x, k_y) = U(k_x, k_y)\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\(u(x,y)\\) at any past state after observing \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\) at a current time without knowing the precise time at which the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the time-invariant nature of harmonic functions under the Laplace equation, knowing \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\) allows for the exact recovery of \\(u(x,y)\\) at any past state using the inverse Fourier transform, despite not knowing the specific time of transformation.",
