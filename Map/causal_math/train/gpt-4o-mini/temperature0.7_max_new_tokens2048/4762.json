  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model involving the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and we apply a Fourier transform to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\) to convert it to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}_t = -k\\\\omega^2\\\\hat{u}\\\\). We are interested in analyzing how transformations in the frequency domain using a function \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2 t}\\\\hat{u} \\\\) affect the system's behavior over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original frequency domain representation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely recover the initial function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0 \\\\). The action of \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\) introduces an additional decay factor that modifies the evolution of the temperature distribution, masking the original conditions.",
