  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of an oscillating term. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is also a constant.\n\nConsidering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) observed at t = T, can the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be accurately inferred if it is unknown whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was involved, it is impossible to determine with certainty the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The (non-linear) influence of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) on the system’s evolution obscures backwards calculation of initial conditions without this critical information.",
