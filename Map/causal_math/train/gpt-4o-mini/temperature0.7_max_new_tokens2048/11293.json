  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Suppose we apply the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) periodically at times \\\\(t_n = nT\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is an integer and \\\\(T\\\\) a constant interval.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) be the same as without applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) modifies the initial condition, scaling it by \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha T}\\\\). The evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the differential equation from this new initial state results in a different trajectory and endpoint at \\\\(t = T\\\\), due to the exponential factor introduced, which scales the magnitude and rotates the phase of the complex number.",
