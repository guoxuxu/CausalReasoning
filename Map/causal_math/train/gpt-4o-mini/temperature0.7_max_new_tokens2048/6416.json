  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, is studied.\n\nBased on the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some final time T, can we identify exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) during the time period till T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modify the state in a manner dependent on the continuous and potentially overlapping parameterization by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Consequently, multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) could yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine the specific transformations used without additional information on the sequence or timing of applications.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the complex-valued function z(t) over time is determined by the differential equation, which states that the rate of change of z(t) is proportional to itself multiplied by the imaginary unit i and a real constant ω. The transformation applied to z(t) through the function f(z) results in its multiplication by an exponential factor e^{at}, indicating that the behavior of z(t) at the final time T is influenced by the transformations applied during the interval up to T.",
