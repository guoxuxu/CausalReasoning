  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t, z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f \\\\) involves a mixture of linear algebraic operations and integral transformations. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} z dt \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of a function \\\\( h(z) = z + e^{Ct} \\\\) is applied, where C is a constant matrix, will the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\), depend solely on the original system's rules and not on the transformations \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory anew, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a function of the initial state, the nature of the system's rules, and both transformations \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\). Since the transformations add complex changes to the evolution, the final state is impacted by all these factors.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The time variable influences the complex variable z, which is affected by the function f; f then determines the state of z at time t. The constant matrix A causes the transformation g(z) which also influences z. The intervention function h(z) directly modifies z, and the constant matrix C affects the function h(z). The time t_1 marks when the intervention occurs, impacting z and subsequently influencing its final state at z(T).",
