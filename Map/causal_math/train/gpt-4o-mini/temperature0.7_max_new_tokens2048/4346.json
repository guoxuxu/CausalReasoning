  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a fixed frequency. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\) is examined over this function, both with and without additional transformations.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\), can we determine the specific value of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) without any additional information about the original function's form?",
  "Explanation": "Although the transformation is specific to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) via \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\\\\), determining \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) uniquely from \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\) alone without knowing that \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) is impossible as similar forms could yield comparable transformation results, leading to ambiguity.",
