  "Problem": "Consider a linear system subject to the equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where D is a constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of applying the transformation \\( T(x) = Lx \\) where \\( L \\) is a linear map represented by a constant matrix, and examining the behavior over a duration \\( t \\).\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were applied (either \\( T(x) \\), \\( U(x) \\), or both) solely by the observed state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( x(T) \\) could result from various combinations of applying \\( L \\), \\( M \\), or neither, depending on how these transformations interact with \\( D \\). The overlap in potential trajectories and the effects of combining \\( L \\) and \\( M \\) create ambiguity and prevent precise identification of which interventions were applied.",
