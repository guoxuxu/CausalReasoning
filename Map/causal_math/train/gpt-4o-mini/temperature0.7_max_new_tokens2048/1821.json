  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the influence of a Fourier transform on this function as an intervention.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initialized at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\) until time T, will the system's behavior be the same as if no initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was specified?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) sets the initial state from which the differential equation progresses. Any changes to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) impacts the solution trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus influencing the future states of the system.",
