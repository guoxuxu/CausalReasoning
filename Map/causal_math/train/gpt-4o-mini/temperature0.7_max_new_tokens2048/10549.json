  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation applied is \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = u_0 + iv_0\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under its own intrinsic behavior, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) effectively rotates the initial vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) in the complex plane by an angle of \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\). This results in a different trajectory, leading to a distinct state at time T compared to the untransformed state.",
