  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. We explore the effects of the linear operator transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\tau e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over different time spans \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the specific function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval \\\\( [0, \\\\tau] \\\\) by knowing the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alone, if no further details are given?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) represents an integral transform which aggregates information and is therefore non-invertible without additional constraints or data about \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Multiple different functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could potentially yield the same result when processed by \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
