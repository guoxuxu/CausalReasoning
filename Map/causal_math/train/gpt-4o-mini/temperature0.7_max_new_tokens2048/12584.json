  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), noted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} \\\\). We examine how convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), whose Laplace transform is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system over time.\n\nIf a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) creating a new function \\\\( f(t) = (g * h)(t) \\\\), and the system evolves under this new function without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} \\\\) at a future time T correspond to the product \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem of Laplace transforms states that the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions in the time domain is the product of their Laplace transforms in the frequency domain. Thus, \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will equal the product \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\), reflecting the compound effect of both functions without any change over time.",
