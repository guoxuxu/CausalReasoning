  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, representing the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( A \\\\). We evaluate the effects of applying Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially given and evolved based on the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly influences its spectrum as analyzed by Fourier transform. The result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any time \\\\( T \\\\) depends explicitly on the nature of \\\\( A \\\\) and the original state \\\\( x \\\\), and changes distinctly over time as the function evolves.",
