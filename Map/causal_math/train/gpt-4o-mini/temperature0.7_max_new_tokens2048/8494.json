  "Problem": "Analyze a system where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(y)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} y(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), giving a transformed function in the frequency domain. Consider effects of an inverse transformation and external modulation by a function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) applied at a specific time.\n\nFrom the frequency domain representation \\\\(F(y)(\\\\omega)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we retrieve the exact time-domain function as it has evolved up to time \\\\(T\\\\) without knowing if any transformations occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about transformations like modulation by \\\\(h(t)\\\\) which could alter the frequency domain characteristics, we cannot guarantee an accurate reconstruction of the time-domain function as it has precisely evolved by \\\\(T\\\\).",
