  "Problem": "Consider a magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} = B_0 e^{-kt} \\\\hat{z} \\\\), acting on a charged particle resulting in the Lorentz force equation \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\vec{v}} = q (\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}) \\\\). We explore the effects of an applied electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} = E_0 \\\\hat{x} \\\\) as a transformation on the particle's motion.\n\nCan the original state of the particle's motion be deduced accurately at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing its trajectory at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing whether the electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\), the trajectory observed at \\\\( T \\\\) could result from different initial conditions, especially since the electric field introduces significant changes in initial velocity and subsequent motions due to its non-conservative nature.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The magnetic field strength B decreases over time due to the factor e^{-kt}. The velocity of the particle is influenced by the Lorentz force, which is determined by the charge q and the vector cross product of the velocity v and the magnetic field B. The applied electric field E affects the force on the particle, which in turn influences its velocity. Without knowing if the electric field E was applied, it is impossible to accurately deduce the particle's original state of motion at time t=0 based solely on its trajectory at time T.",
