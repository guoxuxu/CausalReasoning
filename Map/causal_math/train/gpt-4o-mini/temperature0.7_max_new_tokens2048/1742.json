  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Investigate the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), applied and then reversed on the function.\n\nIf we observe \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without application of any transforms, can we conclusively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) using just the observed value and knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the form of \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\), by knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it's possible to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) through the calculation \\\\( z_0 = e^{-i\\\\omega T}z(T) \\\\), assuming the phase is correctly accounted for.",
