  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant, at different points in time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then it evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to T = t under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) initially modifies the state to \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\). Thus, the solution evolves as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}(Cz_0) \\\\), not simply \\\\( e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\). Unless \\\\( C \\\\) is a multiplicative identity, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) differs due to the scaling by \\\\( C \\\\).",
