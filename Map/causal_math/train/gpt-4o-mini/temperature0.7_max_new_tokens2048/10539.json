  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\\\), where x(t) is the input signal and X(s) represents the transformed signal in the s-domain. We examine the effect of modifications to the system's behavior through convolution with a kernel h(t) resulting in a new output y(t) given by \\\\(y(t) = (h * x)(t)\\\\).\n\nIf at time t1 a filtering operation specified by another kernel g(t) modifies y(t) to produce z(t), will the final outcome Z(s) depend solely on h(t) and not on g(t) or x(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The filtering with g(t) acts as an additional transformation, implying the final Z(s) will depend on G(s), H(s), and X(s), where G(s) is the Laplace Transform of g(t). The final outcome is derived using Y(s) and G(s), resulting in Z(s) = G(s)Y(s) = G(s)H(s)X(s), hence dependent on all three components.",
