  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant complex frequency. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied, resulting in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nGiven a non-zero value of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\) at a specific \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), can we deduce that the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was exactly \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega' t} \\\\) without any additional phase or amplitude adjustments?",
  "Explanation": "A non-zero \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\) indicates the presence of a frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), but it does not specify the exact phase or amplitude of that component in \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The original function could include additional phase shifts or amplitude scalings, which also result in the same frequency in the spectrum.",
