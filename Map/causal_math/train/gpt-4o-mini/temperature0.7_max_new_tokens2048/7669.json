  "Problem": "Contemplate a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves as per the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the scenario under a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve naturally under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by a factor of \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\) which not only changes the magnitude and phase at t = 0 but also results in a different evolution trajectory due to the additional exponential factor involved in the dynamics.",
