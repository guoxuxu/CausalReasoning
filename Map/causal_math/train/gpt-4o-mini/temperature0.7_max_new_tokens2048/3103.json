  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore how the response of the system changes under the effect of external operators such as differentiation or integration over time.\n\nIf the function is differentiated at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), thus changing its form to \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), will the final expression of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original parameters without reflecting the differentiation?",
  "Explanation": "The differentiation acts as an intervention that alters the form and hence the trajectory of the function. The factor \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) introduced by differentiation modifies the amplitude and the response of the system, making the final state reflect this intervention.",
