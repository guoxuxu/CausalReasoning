  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real number representing frequency. Evaluate the transformation by applying the Laplace transform to z(t).\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its Laplace transform \\\\( L{z(t)} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation is invertible under appropriate conditions (such as causality and growth constraints), thus it is possible to accurately deduce \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Laplace transform by applying the inverse Laplace transform.",
