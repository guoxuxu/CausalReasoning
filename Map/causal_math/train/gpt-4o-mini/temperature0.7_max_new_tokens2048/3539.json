  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the elliptic partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = -\\\\lambda u(x, y)\\\\) in a region \\\\(D\\\\). We explore how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which converts functions into their frequency components, influences our understanding of the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) in the spatial domain through a transformation \\\\( u_{new}(x, y) = u(x, y) + h(x, y) \\\\), where \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) is a known function, will the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_{new})\\\\) depend only on the original \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and not on the form of \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) changes the function to be transformed. Consequently, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_{new})\\\\) will reflect not only the influence of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) on the original \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) but also the Fourier transform of \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\). The transformed result in frequency domain is thus a superposition of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(h)\\\\), clearly showing dependency on \\\\(h\\\\).",
