  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how the convolution of another function, \\\\( h(t) \\\\), impacts g(t) in terms of their transforms. Assume both functions are well-behaved and their transforms exist.\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( g(t) * h(t) \\\\) is computed, and then the Laplace Transform is applied to the resulting function, will the Laplace Transform of the convolution be the same as the product of the individual Laplace Transforms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the convolution theorem, the Laplace Transform of the convolution of two functions equals the product of their individual Laplace Transforms. Therefore, the transform of \\\\( g(t) * h(t) \\\\) will be \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\times L[h(t)] \\\\).",
