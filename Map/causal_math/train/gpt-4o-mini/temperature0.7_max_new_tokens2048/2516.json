  "Problem": "Given a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix, consider examining the impact of the linear transformation \\( T(x) = Qx \\) for a matrix \\( Q \\). We investigate how this affects the system across different time points.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( x(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( T(x) \\), \\( S(x) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used based only on the final state \\( x(T) \\) is not feasible due to the potential for similar outcomes from different initial conditions and transformations. The transformations \\( Q \\) and \\( P \\) might not uniquely determine a single trajectory to \\( x(T) \\).",
