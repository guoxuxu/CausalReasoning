  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function's behavior when subjected to Laplace Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and its transformation into the Laplace domain, defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the implications of altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and its effects on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is increased, without any direct intervention in the Laplace domain, will the behavior of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) change correspondingly in terms of its pole locations?",
  "Explanation": "Altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the time domain directly impacts the pole locations in the Laplace transform domain. An increase in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) results in a horizontal shift of the pole, affecting the system's frequency response characteristics due to the relationship \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\).",
