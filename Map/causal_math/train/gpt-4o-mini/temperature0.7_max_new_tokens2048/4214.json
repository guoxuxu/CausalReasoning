  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = C e^{At} \\\\), where A is a skew-symmetric matrix and C is a constant matrix. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transform given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we always retrieve the exact matrices A and C solely from \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( F(s) \\\\) encapsulates information about A and C, retrieving A and C uniquely from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) might not always be possible due to potential ambiguities in matrix decomposition and the loss of some time-domain details in transformation.",
