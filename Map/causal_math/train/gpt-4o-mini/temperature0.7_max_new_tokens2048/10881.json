  "Problem": "Consider the relationship governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), representing the unit circle in the complex plane. Study the behavior of the system when a transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a point \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T represent the square of the evolution that would have occurred had \\( f(z) \\) not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) at t = 0 squares the initial condition. As \\( z_0 \\) is transformed by \\( z(t) \\), the resulting trajectory \\( z(t)^2 \\) effectively doubles the angle due to the properties of exponential functions in the complex plane, aligning with what would occur if each point simply evolved from the squared initial condition.",
