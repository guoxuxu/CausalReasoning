  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform applied to a time-dependent signal modeled as \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency. The transform changes the signal into frequency domain as \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). We further introduce a modulation by multiplying the transformed signal with a function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\alpha |\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0|} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a decay constant.\n\nIf a compensatory function \\\\( h(\\\\omega) = e^{\\\\alpha |\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0|} \\\\) is applied at some intermediate frequency point after the modulation, will the final transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) remain independent of \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the compensatory function \\\\( h(\\\\omega) \\\\) effectively neutralizes the attenuation caused by \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\). This restores the original magnitude of the Fourier components at each frequency, thus making the final signal independent from the initial modulation.",
