  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex numbers, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are complex constants. The function’s evolution over time is analyzed considering linear transformations and their implications on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial values \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) without additional information on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is insufficient to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) without knowing the values of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The transformations depending on these constants can radically alter the initial conditions in a non-invertible way if the constants are unknown.",
