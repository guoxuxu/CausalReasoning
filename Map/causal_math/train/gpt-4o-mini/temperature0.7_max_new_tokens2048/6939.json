  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the spectrum \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the transformations by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) introduces modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that also depend on C along with A and B. This adds complexity to the system's dynamics and affects its frequency-domain representation, hence \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at times after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect the influences of A, B, and C.",
