  "Problem": "Consider a system where a matrix function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dx} = M u(x) \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a constant matrix. We also look into the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{Nx} u(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf we have the result of the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) computed at some \\\\( x = X \\\\), can we determine the original vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) without any baseline information?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation involves integration with a function involving \\\\( N \\\\), both \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) contribute in a non-trivial, intertwined way in the result. Without additional information on either, different combinations of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) can give the same integral result.",
