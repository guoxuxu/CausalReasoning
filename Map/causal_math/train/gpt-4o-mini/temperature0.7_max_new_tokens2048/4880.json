  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the behavior under complex transformations such as \\( f(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), with \\( \\theta \\) being another real constant.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we precisely determine the interventions used (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) by only knowing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the additive nature of the phase shifts from \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\), multiple combinations of \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\) can lead to the same \\( z(T) \\). This makes it impossible to uniquely determine the sequence and specific interventions applied.",
