  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being real constants.\n\nIf we change the initial conditions from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real number, will the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T purely be dictated by the original system dynamics under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the initial condition by multiplying by \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) effectively introduces a phase shift in the complex plane for \\\\( z(0) \\\\). This changes both initial real part \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and imaginary part \\\\( y(0) \\\\), which modifies the trajectory and subsequent state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time T due to the non-linear coupling between x and y.",
