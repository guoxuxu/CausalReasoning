  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We are examining how the Laplace transform, which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i} \\\\) with complex s, affects our causal understanding of this system.\n\nIf we begin with the system at the initial state defined by \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), and observe it evolve up till time T without any transformation applied, will the real part of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) equal to \\\\( \\\\cos(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the system evolves according to the natural progression \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). Since \\\\( e^{it} = \\\\cos(t) + i \\\\sin(t) \\\\), the real part of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) indeed equals \\\\( \\\\cos(T) \\\\), following the identity of Euler's formula.",
