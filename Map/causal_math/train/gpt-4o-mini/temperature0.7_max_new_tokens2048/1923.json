  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T].\n\nIf an intervention occurs at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta)t} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) being a constant shift in frequency, will the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) still be independent of \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a change in frequency creating a different function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. Since the exponential terms differ post-intervention, the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) ultimately changes, reflecting the frequency change denoted by \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\). This leads to a different integral outcome due to the altered harmonic relationship in the exponential terms.",
