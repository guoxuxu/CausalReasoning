  "Problem": "Analyze a stochastic process where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BX dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( dW \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process. Consider the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{CX} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{DX} \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the probability distribution of \\\\( X(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B, C, \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\( B, C, \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) influence the dynamics through the transformations and the stochastic nature of the equation, the final distribution is dependent on all matrices. The new transformation adds another layer of complexity affecting the process’s path.",
