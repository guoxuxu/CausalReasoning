  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are constants. We will explore the effects of applying the transformation defined by \\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) over time.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\( z_0 \\) by \\( g(z) \\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition, which alters the path that \\( z(t) \\) follows. The transformation \\( e^{kt} \\) scales the initial condition and can change magnitude and phase, particularly influenced by the nonlinear term \\( \\lambda z^2 \\).",
