  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, D are constants. The system is subjected to a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing a frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a different constant) is applied as an intervention, will the terminal state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original system's constants and not on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) each modify the trajectory of the state independently, and the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the effects of both applied transformations along with the dynamics dictated by the constants A, B, C, and D. The system's response becomes a superposition of both frequency shifts in the complex plane.",
