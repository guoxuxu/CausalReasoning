  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s\\\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period from 0 to T.\n\nGiven the function at t = T, can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by analyzing the function at T?",
  "Explanation": "As both transformations involve integral accumulations over potentially overlapping intervals, the specific contributions of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to the final state of the function at T are not distinguishable solely based on the endpoint data.",
