  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real frequency parameter. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equal to that obtained by evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( e^{a0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) at t=0, but as it evolves, the multiplicative factor \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) changes the trajectory from what it would be under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) alone. This results in \\\\( z(T) = e^{aT}e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\) instead of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\), hence, the trajectories are fundamentally different.",
