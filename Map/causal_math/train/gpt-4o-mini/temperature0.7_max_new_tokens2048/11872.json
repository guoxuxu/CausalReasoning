  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) dt \\\\). The behavior of the function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is analyzed under different settings, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transform, will the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) for a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\) always result in the function \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is a standard result, always resulting in \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\) regardless of the value of \\\\( s \\\\) (assuming \\\\( s \\\\) has a real part greater than zero for convergence). This demonstrates a deterministic transform from cause (input function) to effect (Laplace transform).",
