  "Problem": "Assume a problem in complex functions where the operation involves applying the Fourier transform on a function \\(\\phi(t)\\), which is described as \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\phi(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\). The transformed function is then acted on by a linear transformation \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), which alters frequencies in a specific predictable way.\n\nIf \\(\\phi(t)\\) evolves under a defined dynamics \\(\\dot{\\phi} = A\\phi\\), where \\(A\\) is a constant matrix, and then a Fourier transform is applied to \\(\\phi(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\), will the transformed output \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi(T))(\\omega)\\) at frequency \\(\\omega\\) be predictable from just the initial \\(\\phi(0)\\) and the asymptotic properties of matrix \\(A\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\(\\dot{\\phi} = A\\phi\\) describes the deterministic evolution of \\(\\phi(t)\\), the state of \\(\\phi\\) at any time \\(T\\) can be explicitly calculated from \\(\\phi(0)\\) under this dynamic. The Fourier transform, being a linear operator, will also maintain this determinism, allowing \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi(T))(\\omega)\\) to be entirely predictable.",
