  "Problem": "Imagine a system where we want to study heat transfer in a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the material. We analyze the scenario where at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) is initially applied, and then see its evolution or the effects of interventions.\n\nKnowing the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely what intervention occurred (the exact location and magnitude of any delta function heat sources) along with its original distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Decomposing the observed end state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) to discern effects of potential interventions from the initial state is highly ambiguous because the smoothening effect of the heat equation masks distinct signals. Multiple configurations of heat sources and initial distributions can yield indistinguishably similar temperature profiles at time \\\\( T \\\\), thereby making it challenging to uniquely identify the interventions.",
