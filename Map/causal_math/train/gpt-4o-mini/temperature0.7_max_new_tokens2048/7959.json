  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\(z = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator, representing the transformation matrix. We explore the effects of applying a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number.\n\nIs the output \\\\(z(T)\\\\) after applying an intervention \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha z}\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is another real number) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), completely independent of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha z}\\\\) further modifies the trajectory initially altered by \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\). Hence, the final output \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on both \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), given their respective influences on the phase and magnitude via complex exponential functions.",
