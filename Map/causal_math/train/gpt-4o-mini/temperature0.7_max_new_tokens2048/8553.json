  "Problem": "Imagine a mechanical system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + p\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. An external force described by a function \\\\(f(t) = A\\\\sin(ωt)\\\\) is potentially applied to the system, affecting its behavior.\n\nIf the system starts with initial conditions \\\\(x(0) = x_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = v_0\\\\), and no external force \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is applied, will the motion of the system at time T be described solely by the homogeneous solution to the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Without the external force, the system's motion is governed only by its inherent properties (p, q) and initial conditions (x_0, v_0), leading to a solution that can be represented as a combination of exponential and sinusoidal functions intrinsic to the homogeneous differential equation.",
