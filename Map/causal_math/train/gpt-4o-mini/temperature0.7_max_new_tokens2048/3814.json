  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We examine the interactions between the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and a linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) on function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial form of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing its Fourier transform at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( L \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( L \\), the transformation that \\( L \\) introduces, specifically the multiplication by \\( t \\), significantly alters the frequency content, making it difficult to reconstruct the original \\( z(t) \\) from the Fourier transform alone.",
