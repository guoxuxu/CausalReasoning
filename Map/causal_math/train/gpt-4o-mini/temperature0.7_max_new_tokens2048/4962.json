  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. The system's state evolution is evaluated under the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nBy examining the output of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\), where T is an arbitrary time, can we deduce the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) always starts from 1 when traced over time from t=0, the Fourier transform will always identify the frequency component at 1, independent of T, thus indicating the initial condition was \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\).",
