  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) and its inverse.\n\nGiven the spectral representation \\\\( Z(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to deduce the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) accurately without knowing whether the Fourier transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation alters the state by converting it into the frequency domain. Without knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), back-transforming \\\\( Z(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) might not accurately restore \\\\( z(0) \\\\) due to potential losses or changes during the transformation and subsequent dynamical evolution.",
