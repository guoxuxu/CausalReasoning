  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source influences the system described by \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) being added to certain regions at specific times.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we conclude definitively what heat source profile \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) was applied during the time interval [\\\\( t_1, t_2 \\\\)]?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple heat source profiles might lead to similar temperature distributions at a later time due to the smoothing effect of the diffusion operator in the heat equation. The precise effects of specific profiles can be masked by simultaneous natural diffusion, making specific identification difficult.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

The spatial distribution of temperature u(x, T) at a specific time T is determined by the heat equation, where the Laplacian of temperature change Delta u also impacts u_t.",
