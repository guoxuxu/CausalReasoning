  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where a function \\( z(t) = e^{it}u \\) for complex \\( u \\) is undergoing transformation with \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\), where C is a complex number. The impact of an operation defined as \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) wherein D is a distinct complex constant is considered.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new operation \\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\) (where E is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( h(z) \\) introduces another modifying factor, affecting the final state \\( z(T) \\) depending on all C, D, and E. These transformations affect how z evolves from \\( t_1 \\) onward and the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) through the compounded effects of the exponential functions.",
