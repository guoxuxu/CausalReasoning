  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The effect of the Laplace transform on this function is studied, denoting the transform as \\\\( L\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without further actions, will the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be different for a different frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) compared to the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\). Changing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) results in a different function \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\). These functions are not equivalent unless \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega' \\\\), indicating a dependency on the frequency.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex-valued function z(t) is derived from the frequency omega, and the Laplace transform Z(s) of z(t) depends on the frequency omega, indicating that changes in omega lead to changes in Z(s). Similarly, if omega is altered to omega prime (omega'), the resulting z(t) will also change, which means Z(s) will differ based on omega' compared to omega.",
