  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are complex numbers. We study the changes in the integral along a path in the complex plane, comparing before and after a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nBy evaluating the integral of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) along the end path, is it possible to reconstruct the original path \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) without knowing \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the value of \\\\( c \\\\), you cannot accurately determine the original path because the same integral result may be attainable from different paths depending on how the translation by \\\\( c \\\\) affects them.",
