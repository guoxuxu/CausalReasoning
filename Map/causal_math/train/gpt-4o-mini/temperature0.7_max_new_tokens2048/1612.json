  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), yielding a new function defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the functional relation \\\\( s \\\\) as it affects the behavior of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) over the complex s-plane.\n\nGiven an adjusted outcome through intervention in the s-plane, \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{2!}{(s-1)^3} \\\\), can we precisely determine that the intervention was multiplication by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) and the original function was \\\\( e^{t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific form of \\\\( G(s) \\\\), which is \\\\( \\\\frac{2}{(s-1)^3} \\\\), indicates a definitive transformation involving both the specific Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{t} \\\\) and the multiplication by \\\\( t^2 \\\\). The factorial and the exponent in the denominator clearly suggest a quadratic time-domain scaling applied to an exponential function, pinpointing both the operation (quadratic scaling) and the original function (exponential growth).",
