  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation represented by the operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iws} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the final service condition \\\\( y(T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we deduce the specific interventions (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), or both) that were applied throughout its evolution only from knowing \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-reversible nature and compounded effects of the integral and differential transformations, the exact sequence or types of interventions cannot be uniquely identified from the final state alone. The modifications introduced by each operation can overlap in effects, causing ambiguity in backward inference.",
