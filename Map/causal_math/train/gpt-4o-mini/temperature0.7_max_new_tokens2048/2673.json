  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) describing the evolution of a function u(x,t) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes u(x,0) to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0)\\\\) and its impact on the solution space.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the initial condition u(x,0) and then the PDE \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) is solved without further intervention, will the function \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > 0 be equivalent to solving the PDE directly from u(x,0)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the representation of the initial condition. Solving the PDE from this transformed space involves different dynamics in the Fourier space, and when transformed back, the solution may differ due to properties of L and how it affects the spectral components represented in Fourier space.",
