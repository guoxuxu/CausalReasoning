  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation describing heat transfer \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We study the impact of applying a Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time t be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) alters the representation of the initial condition into the frequency domain. The heat equation solved in the frequency domain leads to different dynamics compared to the spatial domain solution unless inverse transformed back exactly without any loss of information or modification.",
