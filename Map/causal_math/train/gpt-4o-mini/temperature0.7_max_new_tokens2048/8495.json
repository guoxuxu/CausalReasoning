  "Problem": "Analyze a system where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(y)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} y(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), giving a transformed function in the frequency domain. Consider effects of an inverse transformation and external modulation by a function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) applied at a specific time.\n\nIf a modulation by a function \\\\(h(t) = e^{iCt}y(t)\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant, is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the inverse Fourier Transform at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) reveal the only the influences of \\\\(h(t)\\\\) and not inherent characteristics of the original \\\\(y(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier Transform will reveal a signal influenced both by the original characteristics of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) and the modulation \\\\(h(t)\\\\). The additional modulation adjusts, but does not completely mask, the characteristics of \\\\(y(t)\\\\).",
