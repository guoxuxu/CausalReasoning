  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a periodic input signal \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the signal frequency. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + a y = bx \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n\nIf the input signal frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is doubled, will the steady-state amplitude of the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a much later time be affected without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the input frequency changes the form of the forcing function in the differential equation representing the circuit. This alteration affects the steady-state solution to the differential equation, specifically changing the amplitude response due to the frequency-dependent nature of the system's response.",
