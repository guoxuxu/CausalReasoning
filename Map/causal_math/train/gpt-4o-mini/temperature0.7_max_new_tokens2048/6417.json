  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a curve in the complex plane given by \\\\( z = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, describing an oscillator. We investigate the effects of a linear transformation described by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\\\\\\\ b & a \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) which rotates and scales the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and the system is allowed to evolve under the original oscillator equations without further operation, will the nature of the orbit, i.e., its geometric path in the complex plane, remain invariant at time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( M \\\\) modifies not only the magnitude but also the direction of \\\\( z(0) \\\\), leading to a rotated and scaled orbit. The change in the initial conditions under the matrix M will affect both the trajectory and final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the complex plane.",
