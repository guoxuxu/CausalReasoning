  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t is time. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is calculated for a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T, will \\\\( T(z) \\\\) merely return the integral of the original function without any alteration in the function's behavior?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), which computes the integral from 0 to T, directly evaluates the path of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) during that interval. Therefore, \\\\( T(z) \\\\) reflects the cumulative sum of the exponential function over time without any modification to its behavior throughout the interval.",
