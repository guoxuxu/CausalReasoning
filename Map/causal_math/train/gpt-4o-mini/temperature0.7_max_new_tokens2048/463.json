  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing an oscillatory system. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z(t) e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at the endpoint be only dependent on \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( G(z) \\\\) introduces a damping or growth factor depending on the sign of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), which shifts the frequency spectrum in the Fourier transform. The output of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) after applying \\\\( G(z) \\\\) will include a dependency on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) besides the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), altering the resulting frequency domain representation.",
