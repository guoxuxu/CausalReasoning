  "Problem": "Let's consider the complex plane where the function is defined as \\( z \\mapsto w = e^z \\). Investigate how the transformation of this function affects the analytical structure of a complex domain, specifically whether causal inference about the original complex value (z) can be derived from its transformation (w) under various circumstances.\n\nGiven w at any time \\( t \\), is it possible to uniquely determine the corresponding z without additional conditions or knowledge about the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( w = e^z \\) exhibits periodic behavior on the imaginary axis (every \\( 2\\pi i \\)), knowing only w does not uniquely specify z. There are infinitely many possibilities for z that differ by integer multiples of \\( 2\\pi i \\).",
