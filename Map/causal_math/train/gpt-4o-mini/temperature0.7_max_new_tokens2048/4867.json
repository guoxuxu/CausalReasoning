  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nIf a further transformation, say \\\\( z'(w) = e^{-i\\\\phi}w \\\\) with a different angle \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), is applied midway through the Fourier transform operation over time, will the resulting output depend uniquely on either \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform output will incorporate the effects of both transformations resulting from multiplying rotational factors, leading to a final effective rotation that is a result of both \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\). Thus, the output is a function of the combined transformations, not either one individually.",
