  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the action of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is introduced at time way \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) remains dependent on all parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) scale the magnitude, which influences the overall growth/decay and rotational dynamics of the solution.",
