  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) representing wave propagation, where c is the wave speed. We explore the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to convert the spatial variable into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the wave's state at time T in the frequency domain, can we distinguish whether intermediate Fourier transformations were applied and reversed during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application and immediate reversal of a Fourier transformation leave no trace on the wave function (due to the properties of Fourier transforms), it is impossible to determine from the final state alone whether such interventions took place.",
