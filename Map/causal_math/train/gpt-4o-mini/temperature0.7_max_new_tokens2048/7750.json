  "Problem": "Examine the causal effects in a system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function f(t), focusing on the response of systems described by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\) where a is a constant.\n\nGiven the output response of the system, can we conclusively determine the value of \\\\( b \\\\) in the input function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) without being aware of the specific value of parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the system's transfer function?",
  "Explanation": "The output response is a convolution dependent on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), and with a change in \\\\( a \\\\), the identical output could be generated by different values of \\\\( b \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( a \\\\), the determination of \\\\( b \\\\) solely based on the output is indeterminate, due to the intertwined effects of these parameters in shaping the system’s response.",
