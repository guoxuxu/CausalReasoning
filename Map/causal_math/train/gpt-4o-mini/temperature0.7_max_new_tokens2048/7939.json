  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix and z is a complex variable. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) on the behavior of the system.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a differential operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\) is applied after the integral transformation and before evaluating at z = Z, will the result at z = Z be independent of the initial integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The differential operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\) effectively negates the integral transformation, returning the function to its original form \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\). Therefore, the result at z = Z is independent of the initial integral transformation.",
