  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar frequency. Analyze the behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) at t = 0 and evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\) equal to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), assuming that \\\\( s \\\\neq i\\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is directly calculable and yields \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) when the real part of \\\\( s \\\\) is greater than 0, demonstrating that the system's behavior follows expected analytical results without intervention.",
