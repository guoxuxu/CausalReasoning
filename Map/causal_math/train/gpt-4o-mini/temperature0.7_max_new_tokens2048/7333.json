  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a two-dimensional space, \\(\\Delta u = 0\\), where \\(u(x,y)\\) is the potential function. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to convert the problem into its frequency domain representation, allowing analytical manipulation by \\(\\mathcal{F}[u](k_x, k_y) = U(k_x, k_y)\\).\n\nIf \\(u(x,y)\\) is initially given and transformed via the Fourier transform, and then allowed to evolve naturally under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\) at any future time be the same as if \\(u(x,y)\\) was directly evolved under \\(\\Delta u = 0\\) and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\(\\Delta u = 0\\) indicates that \\(u(x,y)\\) is harmonic and thus time-independent in this context, any Fourier transform of \\(u(x,y)\\) at any time would yield the same result \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\). The Fourier transform of a harmonic function at any future state will remain identical, independent of any evolution.",
