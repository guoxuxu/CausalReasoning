  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We assess the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), applied to a function \\\\( f(t) = t^k \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the transformation result \\\\( T[f](z) \\\\) for a specific \\\\( z \\\\), can the original power \\\\( k \\\\) of \\\\( f(t) = t^k \\\\) be inferred without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function from the integral transformation is \\\\( \\\\Gamma(k+1) z^{-(k+1)} \\\\). From the exponent of \\\\( z \\\\), one can deduce \\\\( k \\\\) as it is related by \\\\( k+1 \\\\) to the exponent. Knowledge of the Gamma function further affirms this relationship.",
