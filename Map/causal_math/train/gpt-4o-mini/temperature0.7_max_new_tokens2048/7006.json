  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number and \\( t \\) is time. This function represents a point moving in a circle on the complex plane. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega' t} dt \\), on this function over the frequency domain \\( \\omega' \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) in the form of a delta function at \\( \\omega' = \\omega \\), can we reconstruct \\( z(t) \\) as \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) without knowing the original function form?",
  "Explanation": "Because the Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is unique and invertible, observing a delta function at \\( \\omega' = \\omega \\) allows us to uniquely identify the original function as \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). This invasion-back property of Fourier transforms ensures the ability to reconstruct the time-domain function from its frequency domain image.",
