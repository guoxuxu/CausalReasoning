  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a particle's position in the complex plane. Assume the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An integral transform \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\) is considered to analyze the system at different instances.\n\nBased on observing the output of \\\\(f(z)(T)\\\\), can we trace back the exact original state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing the functional form of \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) produces a cumulative measure of the state's evolution, obscuring the exact initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) due to the integration over time, which cannot be uniquely reversed without additional information.",
