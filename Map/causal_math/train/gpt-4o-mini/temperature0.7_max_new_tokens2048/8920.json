  "Problem": "In the context of continuous-time Markov chains, consider the transition rate matrix Q for a two-state system where state 0 can transition to state 1 and vice versa. Let \\\\(\\\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\\\) be the state-transition matrix used to solve for the probabilities of state occurrences over time t.\n\nGiven the state probabilities at t = T, can one unequivocally determine whether a change in transition rates (from Q to Q') took place, and when?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the end probabilities at t = T does not reveal if or when the transition rate matrix was changed from Q to Q', because the same terminal distribution could result from different sequences and timings of changes in the rate matrices.",
