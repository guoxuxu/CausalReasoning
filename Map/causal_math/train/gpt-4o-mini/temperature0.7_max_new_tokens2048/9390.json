  "Problem": "Imagine a complex system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{Ct} z dt \\\\) on the behavior of the system over time T.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we unequivocally determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, conclusions about the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) become speculative. The integrating effect of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) may have significantly altered states over time, thus muddling direct inference to any specific initial condition.",
