  "Problem": "In a controlled environment, the complex function \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) is implemented in a system, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a time-parameterized linear function given by \\\\( w = at + bi \\\\), with constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The system's output \\\\( z \\\\) is analyzed before and after the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a fixed time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(w(t)) \\\\) evolves from t = 0 to t = T following its natural dynamics without any external influences, is the transformed output \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) solely determined by the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since there is no intervention, the transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) directly follows from the basic properties and behavior of \\\\( z(w) \\\\). As \\\\( w(t) = at + bi \\\\) fully characterizes \\\\( z(w) \\\\) over time, the complex exponential nature restricts the output to be a function of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) only.",
