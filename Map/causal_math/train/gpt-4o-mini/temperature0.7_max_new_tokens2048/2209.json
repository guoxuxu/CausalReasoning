  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without further modifications, will the transformed value \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) maintain the same magnitude as \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The magnitude of \\\\( e^{iz_0} \\\\) in the complex plane is always 1, regardless of the value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the exponential of a pure imaginary number \\\\( iz_0 \\\\) translates to rotation on the unit circle in the complex plane, not affecting the magnitude.",
