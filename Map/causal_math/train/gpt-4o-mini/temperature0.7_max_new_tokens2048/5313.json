  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace transform of its input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), giving \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\. The output of the system is described by the function \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is the system's transfer function. We examine the effects of modifying the input signal using the transformation \\\\( g(x) = x(t) * e^{-at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an input signal \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then processed by the system without further intervention, will the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at any s be the same as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly processed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the Laplace transform of the input signal to \\\\( X(s+a) \\\\) from \\\\( X(s) \\\\), thus changing the input to the system to \\\\( H(s)X(s+a) \\\\). This results in a different output compared to directly processing \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\), which would have produced \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\).",
