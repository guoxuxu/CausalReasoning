  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is an input signal and \\\\(s\\\\) the complex frequency variable. The system can be studied with an input modification where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(y) = y(t-a) \\\\), for some delay constant \\\\(a\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact delay \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( y(t-a) \\\\) after observing \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) without prior information about the use of \\\\( f(y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( a \\\\) directly from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) requires knowledge that a delay was applied. Without understanding that \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was involved, interpreting \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) might lead to multiple candidates corresponding to various transformations of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), especially if additional factors like scaling are considered. This ambiguity makes the sole determination of \\\\( a \\\\) impossible without additional information.",
