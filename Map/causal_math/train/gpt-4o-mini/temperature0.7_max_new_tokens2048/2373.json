  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) in the complex plane where \\( A \\) is a non-scalar constant matrix. Examine the evolution of the function under different mappings and their compositional effects.\n\nIf a linear transformation \\( T(z) = Bz \\), where \\( B \\) is a constant matrix, is applied to \\( z \\) before \\( f \\), will \\( f(T(z)) \\) at any arbitrary \\( z \\) be the same as if \\( f \\) was directly applied to \\( z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( f(T(z)) = e^{ABz} \\) may not be equivalent to \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) due to the potential non-commutativity of matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) leading to \\( AB \\neq BA \\), thus altering the output substantially.",
