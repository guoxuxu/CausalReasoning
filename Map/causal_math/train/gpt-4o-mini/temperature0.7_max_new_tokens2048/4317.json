  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), widely known as the Laplace transform, applied to the function over time.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the transform's result is inverse transformed without further intervention, will the resulting function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at any time t match the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Provided that the region of convergence includes \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform of the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will return \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since the Laplace transform and its inverse are linear operators and assuming the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is within the transform's capabilities, they should perfectly recreate the original function over time.",
