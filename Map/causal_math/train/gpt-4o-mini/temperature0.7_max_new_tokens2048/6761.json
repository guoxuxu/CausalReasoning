  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is produced by applying a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The output is then transformed by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze how these transformations affect the relationship between input and output over time t.\n\nIf the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a unit step function and we observe the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional transformations, will the system's response \\\\( z(t) \\\\) simply be the convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is solely determined by the convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with the system’s impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This is the typical behavior of an LTI system with no further transformations affecting the output.",
