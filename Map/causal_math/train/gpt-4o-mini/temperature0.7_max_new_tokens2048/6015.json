  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) is applied to transform a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) via the integral \\( G(a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{az} g(z) \\, dz \\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number, and the transformation explores how changes in \\\\( a \\\\) affect the outcome of the integral transformation.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at some time during the transformation, while keeping \\\\( a \\\\) constant, will the resulting \\\\( G(a) \\\\) be independent of the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the internal structure of the integral by altering the function from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Since the outcome depends directly on the function being integrated, the resultant \\\\( G(a) \\\\) will reflect the modification to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) rather than staying consistent with the original \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
