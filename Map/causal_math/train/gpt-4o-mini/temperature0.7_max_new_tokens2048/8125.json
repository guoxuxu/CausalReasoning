  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(u) = u + c\\\\) where c is a constant offset applied to the temperature distribution.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) such that \\\\( u'(x,0) = u(x,0) + c \\\\), and the system is thereafter allowed to evolve under the original heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u'(x,T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved to time T without applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\) alters the initial conditions by increasing every point of the temperature distribution uniformly by c. While the distribution's evolution still obeys the same heat equation, the entire resulting curve \\\\( u'(x,T) \\\\) will be offset by c compared to the curve that would result from evolving \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\).",
