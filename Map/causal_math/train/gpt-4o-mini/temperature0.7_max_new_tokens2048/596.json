  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex scalar. A transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(m\\\\) is a complex scalar.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we deduce exactly which interventions were applied (\\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\), or both), knowing only \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) might be reachable through different combinations of the interventions due to the non-linearities introduced by the exponential and additive transformations in the complex plane. Hence, we cannot determine the interventions uniquely.",
