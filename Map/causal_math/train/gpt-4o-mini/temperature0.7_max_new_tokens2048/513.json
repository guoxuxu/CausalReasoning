  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform applied to a time-dependent signal modeled as \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency. The transform changes the signal into frequency domain as \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). We further introduce a modulation by multiplying the transformed signal with a function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\alpha |\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0|} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a decay constant.\n\nIf the modulation \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied initially at \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega_0 \\\\), and then the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) evolves naturally in the frequency domain without further intervention, will the resultant signal at some frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) match the signal as if the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was transformed at that frequency without modulation?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) alters the original Fourier spectrum by attenuating components away from \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\). This decay effect is not naturally present in an unmodulated Fourier transform, leading to a modified spectrum.",
