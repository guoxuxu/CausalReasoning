  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\). We are examining the effects of a subsequent operation using the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of a modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nCan we determine the exact values of the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used in the operations from the final Laplace Transform outcome of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlap in effects between different parameter settings in the exponential terms, multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) can potentially yield the same final transform result. Without additional information, it's impossible to pin down the exact values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used in the transformations.",
