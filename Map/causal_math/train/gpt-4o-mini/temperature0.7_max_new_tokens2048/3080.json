  "Problem": "In the context of signal processing, consider a system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) passes through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We study the causal inference of output \\( y(t) \\) resulting from the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) applied to \\( x(t) \\) with frequency representation \\( X(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and similarly \\( Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = H(\\omega)X(\\omega) \\), where \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the transfer function of the system.\n\nIf there was a known intervention on \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) is observed, can one conclusively identify whether the modification was a delta function at \\( t_0 \\) or a different function altogether?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact type of intervention in \\( x(t) \\) from the observed \\( y(t) \\) is non-trivial without additional data or assumptions. Multiple types of interventions might yield similar modifications in \\( Y(\\omega) \\), especially given the potential complexities of the system's response \\( H(\\omega) \\).",
