  "Problem": "Analyze a system where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(y)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} y(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), giving a transformed function in the frequency domain. Consider effects of an inverse transformation and external modulation by a function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) applied at a specific time.\n\nIs it possible to determine specifically whether a modulation by \\\\(h(t)\\\\) occured at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\) just by examining the state of \\\\(y(T)\\\\) after applying the inverse Fourier Transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the inverse Fourier and the modulation impacts can be complexly intertwined in the resultant signal, and without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely attribute changes in \\\\(y(T)\\\\) to the modulation at \\\\(t_1\\\\) or to other possible alterations.",
