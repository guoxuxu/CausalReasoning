  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega \\\\tau} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real-valued continuous function of time, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We seek to determine the implications of introducing a perturbation by the function \\\\( f(x) = x + c\\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the sequence of perturbations applied (nature and order of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\)), based solely on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely indicate the specific perturbations used, as various combinations and sequences of operations (perturbing and then restoring, or the reverse) can yield the same result at \\\\( T \\\\). This results in an inability to exactly deduce the history and sequence of perturbations only based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
