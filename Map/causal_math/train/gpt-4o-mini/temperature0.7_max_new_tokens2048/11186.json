  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state of the system. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the effect of B could distort the complex phase and amplitude, masking the initial conditions.",
