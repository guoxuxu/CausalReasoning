  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the effects of differentiating this function and the application of an operation \\\\( T(z) = z' \\\\), where \\\\( z' \\\\) denotes the derivative of z.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( z'(x) \\\\), and then if we allow \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) to evolve naturally without further intervention, will \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) at any point x depend only on the initial integral definition of z?",
  "Explanation": "The derivative operation \\\\( T \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\) will naturally yield \\\\( z'(x) = e^{x^2} \\\\). This transformation does not alter with time or x beyond this formula, and hence, the result at any point x solely depends on the function's original definition through the integral.",
