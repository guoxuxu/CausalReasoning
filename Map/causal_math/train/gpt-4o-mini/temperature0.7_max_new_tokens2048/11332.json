  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = (K * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is a kernel representing a transformation and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(t) = e^{At}K(t) \\\\) where A is a constant.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which modifications were applied (whether \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), or both) during the process, based solely on the final output?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or type of modifications applied to the kernel from the output alone is difficult, if not impossible. The outputs resulting from different modifications or combinations thereof might overlap, further complicated by the properties of the input signal and the non-trivial effects of exponential multiplications on the kernel.",
