  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), widely known as the Laplace transform, applied to the function over time.\n\nIf after applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), an intervention modifies the transform by a factor \\\\( (s - a)^{-1} \\\\), will the time-domain behavior of the modified function depend solely on the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the transform, affecting its inverse and thus the behavior of the resulting time-domain function. The final function becomes a convolution of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), making the behavior dependent on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\).",
