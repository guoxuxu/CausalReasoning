  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its transformation by a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) over all frequencies without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is invertible under appropriate conditions (such as \\\\( z(t) \\\\) being sufficiently well-behaved). Thus, knowing \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) over all frequencies allows the precise reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), implying a direct and unique traceability from effect back to cause.",
