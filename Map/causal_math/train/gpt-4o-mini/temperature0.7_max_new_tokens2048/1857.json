  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We apply a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is a diagonal matrix representing an integral transform.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under both \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be identical to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under its respective differential equations to T?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) alters both the real and imaginary components' initial conditions. The transformation by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) can change the trajectories of x and y distinctly, especially as C may affect the scaling and rotation components differently than A or B.",
