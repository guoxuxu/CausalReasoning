  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the input and output of an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The input function is \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the output function is defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^T K(t,s)x(s) ds \\\\). Here T is a constant and the transformation is observed up to time T.\n\nIs it possible to reconstruct function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing the matrix A used in the kernel function?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) with no knowledge of A is not feasible because the kernel function \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\) contains critical information that defines how input is transformed into output. Without A, the transformation relationship is undefined, making backward calculation to find \\\\( x(t) \\\\) infeasible.",
