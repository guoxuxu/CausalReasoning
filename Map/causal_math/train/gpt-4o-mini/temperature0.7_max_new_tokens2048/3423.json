  "Problem": "Consider a system involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions governed by linear differential equations, and i represents the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a different real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be uniquely determined by the original differential equations governing x and y?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional rotation which modifies the trajectory of the resultant complex function. This makes the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) contingent on both the original transformations (from B) and the intervention (from C), altering the trajectory and final position.",
