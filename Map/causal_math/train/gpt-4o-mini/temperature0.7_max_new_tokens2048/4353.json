  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under the original equations to T = t?",
  "Explanation": "Application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 to \\\\( e^{Ct}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then this transformed state evolves under the original differential equations. The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) affects the initial conditions and overall trajectory, resulting in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved without modification.",
