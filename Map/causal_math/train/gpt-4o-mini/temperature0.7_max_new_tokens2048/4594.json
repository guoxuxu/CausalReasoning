  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\( g(x) \\) defined on \\([0, \\infty)\\) given by \\( G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx \\), often referred to as the Laplace Transform. We are investigating the effects of pre-multiplying \\( g(x) \\) by another function \\( h(x) \\), resulting in \\( H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} h(x)g(x) \\, dx \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( g(x) \\) at \\( x = 0 \\) after observing \\( H(s) \\) at \\( s \\) without knowing whether \\( h(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\( h(x) \\), particularly if \\( h(x) \\) alters the transformation such as scaling, the original \\( g(x) \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( H(s) \\) alone due to potential modifications by \\( h(x) \\).",
