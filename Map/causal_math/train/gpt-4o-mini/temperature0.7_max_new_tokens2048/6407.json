  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t} z \\\\) is applied over time t, with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant. The system operates under the function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( U(z) = e^{-i \\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces a new rotational effect, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), as well as \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\). The transformations both impact the magnitude and phase of the final outcome, influencing the trajectory of the complex function.",
