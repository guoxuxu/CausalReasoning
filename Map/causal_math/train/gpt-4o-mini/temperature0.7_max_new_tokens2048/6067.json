  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( bi \\\\) are real and imaginary components of the complex exponent respectively. The system is subject to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{(c+di)t}z \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\) being constants. Analyze the evolution and causality of this system over time.\n\nAssuming a transformation \\\\( g'(z) = e^{(e+fi)t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at \\\\( t = t_1 < T \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the initial parameters \\\\( a, b \\\\) and not on \\\\( e, f \\\\) or \\\\( c, d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( g'(z) \\\\) significantly affects the trajectory. Now, the state at \\\\( T \\\\) is a result of the multiple exponentials influencing it over different time intervals, making the final state contingent on all parameters \\\\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\\\).",

The constants c and d also directly affect g(z). The transformation g(z) then leads to the final state z(T). The intervention g'(z), influenced by e and f, affects the state z(T) as well.
