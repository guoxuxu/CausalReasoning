  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) where \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\), and \\( x, y \\) are real variables. Here, we further explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\( T[f](\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x, y) e^{-i\\omega x} dx \\) on this system.\n\nIf, after computing \\( T[f](\\omega) \\), an intervention modifies \\( f \\) into \\( g(x, y) = x^3 + i\\omega y^2 \\), and \\( T[g](\\omega) \\) is then calculated, will \\( T[g](\\omega) \\) only depend on the new function \\( g \\) and not the earlier \\( T[f](\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T[g](\\omega) \\) is dependent on the new form of \\( g \\), but understanding its deviation from \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) requires knowledge of both the transformation applied and the prior state. The earlier \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) provides context that contributes to an understanding of how the transformation and the original function's contributions evolve over time.",
