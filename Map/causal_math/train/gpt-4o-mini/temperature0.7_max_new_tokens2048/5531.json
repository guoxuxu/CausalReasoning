  "Problem": "A complex function is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = cz + d \\\\) over time t, where c and d are complex constants.\n\nIf at a predefined time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( M(z) = az + b \\\\) (where a and b are complex constants) is applied, will the outcome \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for any t > t_1 only depend on the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not the coefficients c, d, a, or b?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\( M(z) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the outcome further and makes the final state dependent not only on the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but also complex interplay among the coefficients c, d, a, and b. These transformations change both amplitude and phase, influencing the final outputs in compound.",
