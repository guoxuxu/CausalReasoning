  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) in a rod and time \\( t \\) obeys the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) with thermal conductivity \\( k \\). We investigate the application of a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(x,t)) \\) to convert spatial components of the heat distribution into the frequency domain at time \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nWill the distribution \\( T(x,T) \\) at time \\( T > 0 \\) be the same if \\( T(x,0) \\) is subjected to the Fourier transform initially compared to not applying \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) initially alters \\( T(x,0) \\) by converting it to the frequency domain, affecting how the heat propagates due to the change in initial conditions. The subsequent evolution under the heat equation leads to a different temperature distribution at time \\( T \\).",
