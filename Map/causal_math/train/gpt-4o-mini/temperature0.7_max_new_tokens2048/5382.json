  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). Let us examine the causal effects and inferences in systems characterized by convolution and multiplication operations in the Laplace domain leading to end solutions in time domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace domain representation \\\\( H(s)G(s) \\\\), can we precisely deduce both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) separately without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the multiplicative nature of the transformation (Laplace), knowing \\\\( H(s)G(s) \\\\) alone does not allow for unique determination of both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) separately. Each function could potentially have multiple valid forms that satisfy the product in the Laplace domain, given the non-uniqueness of inverse transforms.",
