  "Problem": "Consider the system described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). The system is analyzed for the impact of multiplying by a polynomial function \\\\( p(t) = t^k \\\\) and then taking the Laplace transform again. Here, \\\\( k \\\\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nIf \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at t = 0, resulting in \\\\( h(t) = t^k g(t) \\\\), and then its Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is taken, will \\\\( H(s) \\\\) be the same as \\\\( s^k G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( p(t) = t^k \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace Transform results in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{d^k}{ds^k}G(s) \\\\), which is generally not the same as multiplying \\\\( G(s) \\\\) by \\\\( s^k \\\\). Thus, the transformations affect the outcome differently.",
