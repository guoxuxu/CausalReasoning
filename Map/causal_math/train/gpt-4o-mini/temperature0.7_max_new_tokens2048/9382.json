  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the application of the Laplace transform on this function and its inverse to determine system behavior over time.\n\nFrom observing the Laplace transform of function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we precisely deduce the value and nature of \\\\( a \\\\) in the original function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), providing a unique signature directly indicating the presence and exact value of \\\\( a \\\\) in the original function based on the pole of the transform.",
