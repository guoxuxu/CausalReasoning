  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The function is modified by an integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt}z(t) dt \\\\), with B as another real constant.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iCt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where C is a real constant) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on A or also on B and C?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( H(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds complexity as it incorporates another integral transformation influenced by C. Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on all three parameters: A, B, and C, due to overlapping effects of these transformations on the state of the system throughout the interval.",
