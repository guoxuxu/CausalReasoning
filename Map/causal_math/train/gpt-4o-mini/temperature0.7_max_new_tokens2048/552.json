  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant and determine how this affects the evolution of the function over time.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately discern whether transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both were applied, solely based on the observed output at T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining precisely which transformations were applied from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is not feasible. The same endpoint could result from varying parameters and transformations, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack the interventions without additional information on \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\), or the sequence of application.",
