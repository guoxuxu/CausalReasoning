  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces out a unit circle in the complex plane over time. Analyze the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) used within the transformation period without knowing any prior functional form?",
  "Explanation": "The output from the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) represents the cumulative integral of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, losing information about specific points or forms of the function z unless it's uniquely invertible, which in general isn't the case for complex functions over an interval.",
