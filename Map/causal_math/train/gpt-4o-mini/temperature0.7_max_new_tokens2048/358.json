  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{(z-a)^2} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane encompassing the singularity at \\\\( z = a \\\\). Analyze how the transformation's effect varies due to perturbing the path \\\\( C \\\\) or modifying the exponential term's coefficient.\n\nCan we definitively trace back the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) after observing the transformation result \\\\( F(z) \\\\) without additional data on the path's modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple contours can yield the same transformation result as specified by the Residue Theorem, provided they properly enclose the singularity. Without additional information about how \\\\( C \\\\) was initially defined or modified, determining the exact original contour solely from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is not feasible.",
