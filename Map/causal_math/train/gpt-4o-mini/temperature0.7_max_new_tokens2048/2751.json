  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We apply a Laplace transform on \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and explore how the transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), behaves under different initial conditions and interventions with additional transformations.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a complex constant, is applied as an intervention to the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before applying the Laplace transform, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s \\\\) still be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) results in the combined function \\\\( e^{(a+b)z} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function becomes \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\), altering the resultant transform.",
