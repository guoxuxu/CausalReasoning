  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a plate is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of an initial transformation using Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x \\\\cdot \\\\xi} u(x, 0) \\\\, dx \\\\) and study the system evolution.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine if any changes in diffusivity constants (from \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\)) occurred at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution, just by knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of different diffusion rates at different times can create similar effects to varying initial conditions or external heat sources/sinks, making it difficult to precisely attribute the observed final state to specific changes in thermal properties without additional data.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature distribution at time T, u(x, T), is influenced by the initial temperature distribution u(x, 0) and the thermal diffusivity constant, κ, which affects the evolution of temperature over time. Changes in the diffusivity constant from κ to κ' during the evolution can lead to variations in the temperature distribution at time T, but the distribution itself does not allow for unambiguous determination of such changes.",
