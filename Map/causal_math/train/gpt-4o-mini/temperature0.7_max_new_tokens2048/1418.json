  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of an integral transformation on a function's Fourier transform. Suppose we have a function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) and we apply the transformation \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\). Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) as applied on both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( T(g)(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(g))(\\\\omega) \\\\), can one unequivocally deduce whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) or an equivalent operation was applied to \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While differences in the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(g))(\\\\omega) \\\\) relative to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) can indicate changes, they do not uniquely confirm that the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, as different transformations can lead to similar spectral changes.",
