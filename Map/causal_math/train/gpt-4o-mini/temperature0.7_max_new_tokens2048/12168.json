  "Problem": "Consider a calculation involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The calculation examines the integral transformation across time t defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\int_0^T z(t) \\, dt \\\\) and impacts of interventions at different stages.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined from t = 0 to T, and the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied directly, will the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T is a fundamental integral in complex function theory, leading to the result \\\\( F(z) = \\frac{e^{i \\omega T} - 1}{i \\omega} \\\\). For certain values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and T (specifically when \\\\( \\omega T = 2\\pi k \\\\) for integer k), this expression simplifies to zero, indicating periods of the function complete full cycles within the interval.",
