  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) and knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) follows \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied is non-trivial because knowing only \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}Bx \\\\) without information about B or x, does not allow us to uniquely backtrack to verify the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) due to potential scalar equivalences in the complex plane.",
