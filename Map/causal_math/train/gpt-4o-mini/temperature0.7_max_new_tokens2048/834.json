  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to an initial complex value \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\). We analyze the transformation and evolution over time t where complex rotations represent the system's dynamics.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(\\\\pi) = -1 \\\\), can we conclude that the starting value was \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) without any knowledge of interventions or other initial states?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( z(\\\\pi) = -1 \\\\) results from \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), it is not the only possibility. Any scenario starting with any point \\\\",
