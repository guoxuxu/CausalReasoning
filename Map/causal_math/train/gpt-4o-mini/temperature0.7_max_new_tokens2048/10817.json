  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real frequency. Assess the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau} z(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the system at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T influence the trajectory directly described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the system's behavior over time but does not directly alter the system's trajectory governed by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\), which evolves independently of the integration process.",
