  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector. The system is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt'}N dt' \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be unaffected by \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by adding an integrated effect of N over the period from 0 to T, driven by exponential terms of M. This changes the trajectory of the system from what would have been observed if only \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\) were allowed to act on \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
