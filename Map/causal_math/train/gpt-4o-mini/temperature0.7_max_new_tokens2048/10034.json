  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system is initially affected by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nSeeing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can it be conclusively determined whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation affects the initial condition in a potentially complex and non-invertible way (depending on A), the state at time T has no unique traceability to a specific initial condition without additional information about the presence or parameters of transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\).",
