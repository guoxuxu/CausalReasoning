  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane wherein a transformation \\\\( z \\\\to e^{kt} z \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where k is a complex constant. Analyze the transformation's effect on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a closed contour C.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\to f(e^{kt} z) \\\\) is applied to the function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then evolves over time t without further intervention, will the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) remain the same?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation involves a scaling and rotation in the complex plane, depending on k, this modifies the function's values along the contour. The integral will thus generally not be invariant unless f has specific properties (like holomorphy and k purely imaginary), or other special conditions are met.",
