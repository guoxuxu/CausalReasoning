  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and its impact under a Fourier transformation, specifically looking at \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) without knowing if any prior transformation was applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{e^{az}\\\\}(k) \\\\) is specific to \\\\( a \\\\), without information on any prior modification to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), assumptions about solely relying on \\\\( a \\\\) might be invalid. Other transformations could have adjusted the function \\\\( z \\\\) in a way that alters the output of the Fourier transform.",
