  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) describes the voltage distribution over a line at position x and time t, and v is a positive constant reflecting the properties of the material. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nCan we determine the original voltage distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) after observing the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at time T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature and reversibility of the Fourier transformation, it's possible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\), regardless of the knowledge about the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\).",
