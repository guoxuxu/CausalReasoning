  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where an input signal \\( x(t) \\) is passed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution with an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). The transformed signal \\( y(t) \\) is then subjected to a Fourier transform, generating \\( Y(\\omega) \\).\n\nGiven \\( Y(\\omega) \\) at the output, can we determine if the intervention with \\( g(t) \\) took place, assuming we know \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the intervention \\( g(t) \\) specifically from \\( Y(\\omega) \\) is challenging without additional constraints or information. Different \\( g(t) \\) could lead to similar alterations in \\( Y(\\omega) \\), especially if \\( G(\\omega) \\) and \\( H(\\omega) \\) have overlapping spectral effects. The non-uniqueness of the convolution in the frequency domain makes it difficult to identify the exact nature of the intervention.",
