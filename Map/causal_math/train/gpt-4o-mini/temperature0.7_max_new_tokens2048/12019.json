  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nAfter knowing the final state of the system post-intervention at \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we precisely tell whether the intervention \\\\( g(w) \\\\) was applied and disentangle the effects of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the presence and effect of the intervention and distinguishing between the contributions of A and B solely from the final state is complex. The transformations could yield similar outputs for various configurations of A and B, making the recovery of specific intervention details uncertain.",
