  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the response of the system to an input transformation \\\\(h(u) = u \\\\cdot e^{Dt}\\\\) over time t, where D is a constant operator.\n\nCan the original state \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0 be precisely determined from observing \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(h(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\(h(u)\\\\), and given that the transformation modifies the initial state in a possibly non-reversible way depending on D and L, the original state \\\\(u_0\\\\) cannot be determined unambiguously from \\\\(u(T)\\\\) alone.",
