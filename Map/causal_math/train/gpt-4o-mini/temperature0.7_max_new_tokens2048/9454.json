  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We look into how the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a real constant, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to precisely backtrack to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), determining the exact original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be certain. The transformation \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) adds a phase shift which, without the value of B, creates ambiguity in reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the state at T.",
