  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\) where c is a real number is applied at some time after \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\( g(f(z)) \\\\) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the resulting value by adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\), shifting the phase of the complex exponential. This change makes the final outcome dependent on both the original function and the intervention.",
