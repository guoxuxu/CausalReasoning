  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = C \\\\int_0^t \\\\exp(A(s-t))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A, B, and C are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) where D is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf after a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is altered to a new control \\\\( v(t) \\\\), will the system's output \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) rely exclusively on the new control input \\\\( v(t) \\\\) irrespective of the initial conditions set by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and D?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affects both the integral's future values and the system's response due to the integral's dependency on past values of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Additionally, the transformation matrix D impacts the resulting system output, tying the output to all previous system states and inputs, not just \\\\( v(t) \\\\).",
