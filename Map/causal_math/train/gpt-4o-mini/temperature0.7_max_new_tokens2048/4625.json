  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the input signal and \\\\(e^{i\\omega s}\\\\) is a complex exponential function used for frequency analysis. The transformation aims to filter or modify the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is a pure sinusoidal function of a specific frequency \\\\(\\omega_0\\\\), will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T present a significant response if \\\\(\\omega_0 = \\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) matches the frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) of the complex exponential, the integral will capture primarily the component at this frequency, leading to a resultant function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) that exhibits a strong signal at \\\\(\\omega_0 = \\omega\\\\). Due to integral properties with periodic functions of matching frequencies, the output will have significant amplitude.",
