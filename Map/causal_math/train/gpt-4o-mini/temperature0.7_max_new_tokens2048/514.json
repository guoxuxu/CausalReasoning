  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform applied to a time-dependent signal modeled as \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency. The transform changes the signal into frequency domain as \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). We further introduce a modulation by multiplying the transformed signal with a function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\alpha |\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0|} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a decay constant.\n\nCan we infer the exact original time-domain signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solely from the modulated frequency-domain representation \\\\( X(\\\\omega) g(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), without knowing the decay constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the decay constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it is not possible to accurately reverse the effects of the modulation to retrieve the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The form and extent of modulation, which affects amplitude and phase across frequencies, is critical for an accurate inverse Fourier Transform.",
