  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) representing the solution to a system of linear differential equations with a matrix A. An external operator modifies the trajectory through a time-dependent matrix transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the functional form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can the initial condition \\\\( x \\\\) be deduced accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of an unknown \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) as part of the evolution implies that the transformation incurred can be incompatible or non-invertible with respect to \\\\( A \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( B \\\\), it is impossible to reverse the effect of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) reliably to retrieve the initial \\\\( x \\\\).",
