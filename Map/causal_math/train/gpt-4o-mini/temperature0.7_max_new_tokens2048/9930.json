  "Problem": "Consider the equation governing the heat conduction in a rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the spatial variable. Assume the rod is initially at rest with a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) and that k is a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution at some time T, \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\) without knowing any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Using the properties of the heat equation and assuming the diffusive nature of heat, the initial temperature distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\) can be uniquely reconstructed by applying the inverse of the heat kernel to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). This assumptions presuppose the equation is well-posed and the heat kernel can be appropriately inverted.",
