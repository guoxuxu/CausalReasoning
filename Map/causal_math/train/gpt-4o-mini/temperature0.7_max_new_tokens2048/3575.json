  "Problem": "Investigate the equation \\\\( dz = z \\\\cdot dt + x \\\\cdot dW \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a function of time driven by a deterministic component and a stochastic component influenced by \\\\( x \\\\), and \\\\( W \\\\) represents Brownian motion. Consider the impact of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( x \\\\) at different intervals.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( k(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( x \\\\) and not on the earlier applied \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) while initially starting with \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) means that the process \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is affected by \\\\( x^2 \\\\), and from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T by \\\\sqrt{x}. Therefore, the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both transformations, resulting in a dependency on both the initial and intervening transformations.",
