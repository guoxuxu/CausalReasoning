  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( p(x) \\\\) modifies the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to form a new function \\\\( q(x) = p(x)h(x) \\\\), and then its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(q)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is taken, will the transformed result directly correspond to the Fourier transform of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) multiplied by the Fourier transform of \\\\( p(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the convolution theorem in Fourier analysis, the Fourier transform of the product of two functions, in this case \\\\( q(x) = p(x)h(x) \\\\), equals the convolution of their individual Fourier transforms. Given that \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a Gaussian function, its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian, hence \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(q)(\\\\omega) \\\\) results from convoluting \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\) with a Gaussian, not just a simple multiplication.",
