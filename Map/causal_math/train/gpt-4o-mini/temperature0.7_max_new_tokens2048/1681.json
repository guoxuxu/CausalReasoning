  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the variable s.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined for all t and the Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is computed, will the peak of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) occur at s equal to \\\\( \\omega /(2\\pi) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) results in a delta function centered at \\\\( s = \\omega / (2\\pi) \\\\), indicating the peak frequency component of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( \\omega /(2\\pi) \\\\). This demonstrates the direct causal relationship from the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to its Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without any external intervention.",
