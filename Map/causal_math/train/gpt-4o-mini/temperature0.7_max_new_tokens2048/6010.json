  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions modified by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) on the boundary \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) to solve for the internal values of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan the original boundary conditions on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\) be uniquely determined based solely on knowledge of the solution \\\\( z \\\\) inside \\\\( D \\\\) after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform provides a method to solve for \\\\( z \\\\) under given boundary conditions, obtaining \\\\( z \\\\) inside \\\\( D \\\\) does not uniquely determine what these boundary conditions were, especially without further information about how the transform and the inverse transform were applied and computed.",
