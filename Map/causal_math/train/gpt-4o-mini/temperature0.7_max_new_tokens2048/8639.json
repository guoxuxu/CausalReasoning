  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing a circular trajectory in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of a transformation implemented by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t and its effects on the system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) introduces a phase shift \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), which modifies the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alongside the original parameters \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This phase change, combined with the original path, alters the outcome compared to without the intervention.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The time t causes the value of z(t). The constant r influences the value of z(t). The constant ω also influences the value of z(t). The function g(z) transforms z(t) into a new state that is influenced by θ. The function f(z) transforms z(t) into another state that affects the endpoint z(T). The transformed state from g(z) leads to z(T), indicating that z(T) depends on both the transformation and the initial parameters.",
