  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\\\), where x(t) is the input signal and X(s) represents the transformed signal in the s-domain. We examine the effect of modifications to the system's behavior through convolution with a kernel h(t) resulting in a new output y(t) given by \\\\(y(t) = (h * x)(t)\\\\).\n\nBased simply on observing z(t) at a certain time moment, can the exact kernel g(t) used in its creation be identified irrespective of h(t) and x(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying g(t) just from z(t) is complex as the final signal z(t) is a result of compounded transformations involving h(t) and x(t). Different combinations of g(t), h(t), and x(t) could lead to the same z(t), making it unclear what g(t) was used without additional information.",
