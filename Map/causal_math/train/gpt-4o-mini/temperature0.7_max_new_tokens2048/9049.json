  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) represents a complex-valued function where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. This function is transformed by a complex exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies both the amplitude and phase of the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) introduces a continuous rotation in the complex plane, altering the trajectory and thus the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any later time T.",
