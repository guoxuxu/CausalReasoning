  "Problem": "Examine a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) with an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\), where L represents a linear differential operator. We consider the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition.\n\nIf one observes the transformed state \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t, can they infer the original state \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) accurately without knowing the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial application of the Fourier transform, it is impossible to correctly back-calculate to the original form of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) as the transformed initial condition affects the evolution under the operator L, resulting in a state that does not directly map back to the original \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\).",
