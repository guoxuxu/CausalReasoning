  "Problem": "Let us consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We analyze how this function transforms under the application of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) and also how it behaves when modified by a scheduled intervention described as multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by a complex multiplication by \\\\( c \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), altering the function to become \\\\( cz(t_1) \\\\), will the function at T > t_1 depend solely on the original transformation under \\\\( D \\\\) and not on \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) fundamentally modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by transforming it to \\\\( cz(t_1) \\\\). Thus, the future values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 depend not only on \\\\( D \\\\) but also on the scaling and rotation introduced by \\\\( c \\\\).",
