  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) with a thermal diffusivity constant k. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied as a functional alteration, impacting the system's response to thermal inputs.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is initially applied to an initial heat distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), and the system is then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further manipulation, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) be the same as if the initial distribution was unaltered and evolved under \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier Transform alters the initial conditions by transforming the thermal distribution into frequency space. This transformation changes the basis in which the heat equation operates, ultimately affecting the evolution and resulting in a different temperature distribution at time T.",
