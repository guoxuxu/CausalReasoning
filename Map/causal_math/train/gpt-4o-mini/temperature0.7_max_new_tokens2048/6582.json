  "Problem": "Consider a system based on the function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real scalar. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Bz \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix, on the variable \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the evolved state \\\\( z(X) \\\\) at x = X, can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Bz \\\\) was applied at x = 0, assuming no knowledge of the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolved state \\\\( z(X) = e^{Ax}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{Ax}Bz_0 \\\\) without knowing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine whether B was applied, especially since multiple matrices or initial conditions could have resulted in the same \\\\( z(X) \\\\).",
