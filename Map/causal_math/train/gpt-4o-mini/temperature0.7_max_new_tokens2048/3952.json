  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying a Laplace Transform L on a function g(t), where g(t) = e^(At)x for a constant matrix A and an initial vector x.\n\nGiven L{ŷ(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * Mx for some matrix M, can we determine what the matrix M was or whether it was applied, only by observing L{ŷ(t)}?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing L{ŷ(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * Mx alone cannot uniquely determine M, as multiple matrices M could lead to the same transformation result given different initial vectors x. There is inherent ambiguity in reverse engineering the operator M just from the result of L{ŷ(t)}.",
