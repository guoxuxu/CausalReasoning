  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by the eigenfunction expansion \\\\( u(x, t) = \\\\sum_n a_n(t) \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\), where \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) are the time-dependent coefficients and \\\\( \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\) are the eigenfunctions. An operation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is defined as applying a differential operator, specifically \\\\( F(u) = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is initially applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), and then the system is evolved based on the eigenfunction expansion without further application of \\\\( F \\\\), will the system at time t = T, represented as \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), be the same as it would be if \\\\( F \\\\) was not applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( F(u) \\\\) modifies the coefficients \\\\( a_n(0) \\\\), thereby altering the initial states from which the time evolution begins. This change results in a different configuration at time T since the evolution of each mode is impacted by the initial conditions set by F.",
