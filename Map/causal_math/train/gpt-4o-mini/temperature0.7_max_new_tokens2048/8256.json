  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The effect of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\), is applied to analyze the frequency components of z(t).\n\nCan we deduce from the Fourier transformed signal \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone whether any intervention changed the frequency during the signal’s initial time evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform could reveal multiple frequency components, but it cannot specify when or how the frequency changes were made solely based on the frequency domain data. Additional temporal information would be required for such an inference.",
