  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process characterized by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+ib)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real constants representing decay/growth rates and oscillatory behavior respectively. We explore the consequence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on the process.\n\nCan the original parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) be uniquely determined from the outcome of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the function form or additional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) uniquely from just the integral result \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) is challenging due to potential overlap in outcomes from different values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Multiple combinations could produce similar integration results, especially without specific knowledge of the decay/growth rates or cyclic behavior inherent to the process.",
