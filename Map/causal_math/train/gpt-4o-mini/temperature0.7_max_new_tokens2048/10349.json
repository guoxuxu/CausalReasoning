  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a complex plane, influenced by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf no modification is made and the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based solely on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) for some time T, will the transformed state after applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) remain the same as the original state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the complex function via integration. It accumulates all prior states transformed by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), which ultimately results in a different outcome compared to just evolving the state under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\).",
