  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a continuous function. The transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) is explored, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nWill transforming \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) and then applying the system's Laplace transform result in the same \\\\( G(s) \\\\) as \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) has a Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t) e^{at}) \\\\) which by the properties of the Laplace transform, specifically the time shift theorem, equals \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\). Thus, the effect of this transformation and direct application of Laplace transform to the altered function results in \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\), maintaining the relationship of the transform across shifted domains.",
