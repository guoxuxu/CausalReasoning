  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation on a complex function defined as \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. This transformation represents a Laplace transform that is widely used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems. The goal is to explore the manipulation and impacts of such transforms in various configurations, considering intervention by a differential operator.\n\nKnowing the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), is it possible to determine uniquely that the original function was \\\\( x(t) = e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is unique, meaning that a given transform result corresponds to one specific original function under the condition that the original function meets the criteria for transformation, thereby accurately tracing back to \\\\(x(t) = e^{at}\\\\).",
