  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = \\log(z(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\log \\\\) denotes the complex logarithm. Consider the effects of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then observed evolving naturally under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), does applying \\\\( T \\\\) affect the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the system, which in turn affects the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Since the complex logarithm depends directly on the argument of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), changing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by means of \\\\( T \\\\) alters the resulting path of \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
