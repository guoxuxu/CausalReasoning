  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the square root of -1 and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the transformation under a subsequent function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\\\omega \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 = T/2 \\\\), will the end function at time T still reflect the original formulation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) halfway through the integral affects the frequency component of the exponential, thereby altering the trajectory of the function from that point, affecting both the amplitude and phase of the resultant complex integral.",
