  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function defines wave-like motion in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied to study its effect.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined at time t = 0 and allowed to evolve according to its rule without further modification, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any time T be influenced by the matrix \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is wholly independent of \\\\( B \\\\) and solely depends on \\\\( A \\\\). The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane is governed by the exponentiation with \\\\( iA \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) playing no role.",
