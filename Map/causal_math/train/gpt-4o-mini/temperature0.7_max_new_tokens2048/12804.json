  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is used to modulate an input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The output signal is given by \\\\(y(t) = z(t) \\\\cdot x(t)\\\\). The goal is to study the changes in the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) as compared to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is a simple sinusoidal function without any phase shift, and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is applied initially, will the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at time t show a frequency shift corresponding to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the modulation \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) effectively shifts the frequency of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the Fourier Transform domain. This is a basic property of Fourier Transform, where multiplying by a complex exponential results in a frequency shift.",
