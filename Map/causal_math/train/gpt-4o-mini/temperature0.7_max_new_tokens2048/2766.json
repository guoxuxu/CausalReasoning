  "Problem": "Assess a dynamic system governed by partial differential equation \\\\(u_{xx} + u_{yy} + \\lambda u = 0\\\\) defined over a domain \\\\(D\\\\) with boundary conditions. Consider an integral transform \\\\(T(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\lambda xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) and its impact on the solution \\\\(u\\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), is it possible to accurately determine \\\\(u_0\\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T\\\\) modifies the starting state in such a way that recovering the exact \\\\(u_0\\\\) from \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at any later time \\\\(T\\\\) without knowing about the application of \\\\(T\\\\) is infeasible. The integral transformation effectively obscures certain characteristics of the original function \\\\(u_0\\\\).",
