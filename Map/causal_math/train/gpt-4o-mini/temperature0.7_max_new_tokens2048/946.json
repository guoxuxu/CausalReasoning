  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over the complex domain and transformed through a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} z(x) \\\\, dx \\\\). We aim to analyze the relationship between the original function and its transform's behavior, specifically through operations such as scaling and modulation.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine if a scaling transformation has been applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone doesn't indicate whether a scaling was applied because multiple functions can produce similar transforms due to the properties of the Fourier transformation, such as frequency scaling and amplitude adjustment, which may compensate each other.",
