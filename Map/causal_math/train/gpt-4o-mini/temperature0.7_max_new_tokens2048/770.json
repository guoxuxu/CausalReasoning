  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{izt} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represents a function of time. This scenario deals with the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and explores what happens as this transformation is applied to different functional forms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result \\\\( f(z) \\\\) as a set of Dirac deltas, can we determine that the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was a sine wave without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While a set of Dirac deltas at specific frequencies highly suggests a sinusoidal original function, without further information, other time-domain functions could theoretically produce similar frequency-domain representations, especially considering phase and amplitude modifications.",
