  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a certain domain with prescribed boundary conditions. Suppose an operator \\\\( T: u(x) \\\\mapsto u(x) + c \\\\cos(x) \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, is applied externally.\n\nKnowing the field \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t \\\\), and without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the original state \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at the boundary?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation applied by \\\\( T \\\\), it would be impossible to deduce whether the added \\\\( c \\\\cos(x) \\\\) term was part of the original solution or introduced by the operator, as both scenarios could lead to the observed \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\).",
