  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) defined over complex numbers, and its transformation over time t using \\\\( T(p(z)) = \\\\int_0^t e^{z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nBy observing the value of \\\\( T(p(z)) \\\\) at \\( t = T \\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( g(z_0) \\) without knowing the specific path taken over \\( t \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by integration adds complexity, and different initial values of \\( z \\) could result in the same integral value at \\( t = T \\) due to the properties of complex function behavior and integration, making it impossible to reverse uniquely.",
