  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the application of the Laplace transform on this function and its inverse to determine system behavior over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transform and then is transformed back using the inverse Laplace transform, will the resulting function at time \\\\( t \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is linear and reversible for functions like \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number. Applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse effectively reconstructs the original function, leaving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) unchanged over time.",
