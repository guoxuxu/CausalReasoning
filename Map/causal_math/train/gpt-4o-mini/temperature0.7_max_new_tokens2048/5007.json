  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping operation where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) representing the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real number) is applied as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( c \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiple transformations (both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( k(z) \\\\)) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modify the evolution path and final state at different rates and directions in the complex plane, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reliant on all parameters (\\\\( c, \\\\omega, \\\\alpha \\\\)), not just \\\\( c \\\\).",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of z(t) over time is influenced by the transformations h(z) and k(z), with h(z) depending on omega and k(z) depending on alpha. However, the final state z(T) is determined by the state of z(t) after the transformations, leading to a conclusion that z(T) ultimately depends on c and not on omega or alpha.",
