  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across a capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{C}I\\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and I is current. Evaluate the impact of a sudden change in current input described by a Heaviside step function \\\\( I(t) = I_0u(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside function and \\\\( I_0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf I(t) is applied suddenly at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{C}I\\\\) with \\\\( I = I_0 \\\\) constant for all t > 0 without further intervention, will V(t) at t = T equal the steady-state voltage of \\\\( V = RI_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The voltage across the capacitor approaches a steady-state value of \\\\( V = RI_0 \\\\) as t tends to infinity under the given conditions. This is due to the exponential decay of the transient response and the continuous force of the constant current.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The current input I(t) directly influences the voltage V(t) across the capacitor, and the change in current affects the rate of change of voltage dV/dt. The resistance R and capacitance C also impact the voltage V(t) in the circuit. Ultimately, the voltage V(t) approaches a steady-state value determined by the product of resistance R and current I_0.",
