  "Problem": "Consider a setup where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time in accordance to two linear systems \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Qy \\\\), with P and Q being constant matrices. The impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\), where R is another constant matrix, is examined.\n\nOn observing \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we unequivocally deduce the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which scales the complex vector, it's impossible to uniquely determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if the matrix R does not commute with P and Q, or if the scaling completely masked or altered the inherent dynamics of the systems.",
