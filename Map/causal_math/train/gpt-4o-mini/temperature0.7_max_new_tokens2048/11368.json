  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dx = (Ax + u)dt + BdW\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are constant matrices, \\\\(u\\\\) is a control input, and \\\\(dW\\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We analyze how the output function \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) behaves under different conditions, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix outputting the observable state.\n\nAssuming we observe \\\\( f(x(T)) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the path of the control input \\\\( u(x) \\\\) used if all other parameters (\\\\( A, B, C \\\\)) are known?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the resultant state's output does not uniquely determine the control trajectory primarily due to the complicating effects of the stochastic processes involved. Different control paths \\\\( u(x) \\\\), combined with variations in \\\\( dW \\\\), could feasibly lead to equivalent observation outputs at time \\\\( T \\\\), obscuring the specific control actions taken.",
