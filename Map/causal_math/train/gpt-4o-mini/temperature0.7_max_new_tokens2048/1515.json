  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency of the system. We explore the effects of a linear transformation \\\\(T(x) = Ax + B\\\\), where A and B are matrices, on the system's state.\n\nIf at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a linear transformation \\\\(U(x) = Cx + D\\\\) (where C and D are matrices) is applied as an intervention, will the system state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) for t > t_1 exclusively depend on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on A, B, C, or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(U(x)\\\\) brings additional changes to the system’s state, thereby making the final state at any given time \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) dependent on the A, B, C, D as well as the oscillator's own dynamics characterized by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). Adding these transformations can fundamentally affect the trajectory and the resulting state due to linear superposition and shifts caused by the transformations.",
