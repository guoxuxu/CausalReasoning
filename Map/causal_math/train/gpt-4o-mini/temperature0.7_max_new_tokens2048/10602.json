  "Problem": "Consider the influence of an external magnetic field B on a particle with charge q and the trajectory described by the vector position function \\\\( r(t) \\). Assume the magnetic field introduces a force per unit charge represented by the vector function \\\\( F(t) = qv(t) \\\\times B \\), where \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is the velocity vector of the particle at time t and \\\\times denotes the cross product.\n\nCan the initial velocity vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be uniquely determined from the position \\\\( r(T) \\\\) at a later time T, without intervention but in the presence of the magnetic field?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the magnetic field on the particle's motion depends on the initial velocity's orientation relative to the field. Without distinct direction data or initial conditions, multiple initial velocities could yield the same final position after interaction with the field.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The external magnetic field B and the charge q both contribute to the force F(t) acting on the particle. The velocity vector v(t) of the particle influences the force F(t) through the cross product, which in turn affects the trajectory described by the position function r(t). The position function r(t) subsequently influences the velocity vector v(t), and the position at a later time r(T) relates back to the initial velocity v(0).",
