  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We investigate the effect of the complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation regarding the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's ambiguous whether the transformation \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) influenced the initial values at any point. The lack of knowledge about B's influence means that multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed result at \\\\( T \\\\), due to the potential non-trivial commutation properties of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",
