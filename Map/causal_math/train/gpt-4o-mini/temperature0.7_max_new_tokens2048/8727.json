  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) on a vector \\\\( v \\\\) in a vector space, where A is a constant matrix. Assessing the role of an additive perturbation \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) applied to this transformation, where \\\\( w \\\\) is another constant vector.\n\nIf we apply an intervention \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the dynamics governed by \\\\( B \\\\) and not on the initial transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds the vector \\\\( w \\\\) to whatever state the system is in at \\\\( t_1 \\\\. This change alters the trajectory that the system would have followed under \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) alone, hence the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the linear transformation \\\\( A \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( w \\\\).",
