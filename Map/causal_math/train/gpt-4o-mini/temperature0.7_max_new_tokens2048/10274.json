  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) which acts on a vector space and is defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\. The system evaluates the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the system dynamics when subjected to another transformation \\\\( S(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, at different instances.\n\nWithout intervening with any additional transformations, can we infer the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from the observed state \\\\( x(t) \\\\), assuming only \\\\( M \\\\) influenced the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformation was solely dictated by \\\\( M \\\\) and was linear, inverting \\\\( M \\\\) (provided it is invertible) can uniquely trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from any future state assuming no external influences.",
