  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a circular motion in the complex plane. We then examine the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) and the system evolves under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will the system's state at a later time \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\) be identical to evolving the system without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial conditions by squaring the complex number, changing its magnitude and phase. Specifically, the transformation affects the trajectory such that the final point corresponding to \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\) will not be the same, as \\\\( g \\\\) modifies both the period and the amplitude of the oscillation.",
