  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system dynamics are further influenced by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf observing the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\), can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "From the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it is impractical to determine if the initial state was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^m \\\\) due to the exponential nature of both the transformation and the evolution function. Both could yield similar results under different configurations of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\), complicating back-calculation to the original form.",
