  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\} \\\\). We study the behavior under a convolutional operation with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), such that the resulting function is \\\\( u(t) = (g * h)(t) \\\\) with its Laplace Transform \\\\( U(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) are convolved to form \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and no other operations are performed, does the Laplace Transform \\\\( U(s) \\\\) remain a simple product of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any intervention, the convolution of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) directly leads to a transformed product \\\\( U(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\). The Laplace Transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual transforms without any alterations, assuming initial conditions are zero.",
