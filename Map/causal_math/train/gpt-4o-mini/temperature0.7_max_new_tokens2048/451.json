  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( F(z_1, z_2) \\\\) where \\\\( z_1, z_2 \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of different contour deformations in the complex plane when computing the contour integral of \\\\( F \\\\).\n\nIf part of the contour is intentionally repositioned to enclose an additional pole during the integration process, will this change the result of the contour integral of \\\\( F(z_1, z_2) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When the contour is modified to enclose additional poles, the residue theorem implies that residues of \\\\( F \\\\) at these poles must be accounted for in computing the integral. Thus, modifying the contour to enclose more poles directly affects the outcome of the integral, altering its value by the sum of the residues at the newly included poles.",
