  "Problem": "We analyze a mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) of a mass evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -kx \\), a simple harmonic oscillator, where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. We introduce transformations via \\( f(x) = A \\sin(Bx) \\) at different instances to investigate causal influences.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( g(x) = C \\cos(Dx) \\) is applied, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend exclusively on the original differential equation (\\( -kx \\)) parameters and not on \\( A, B, C, \\) or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(x) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces yet another alteration to the state of the system. This change in conditions impacts the trajectory and final state \\( x(T) \\) in a manner dependent on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), in addition to the transformations made by \\( f(x) \\). The final state \\( x(T) \\) thus depends on these interventions in conjunction with the original system parameters.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The position of the mass at time t, x(t), directly influences its acceleration, represented by the second derivative, ddot{x}. The acceleration, ddot{x}, is determined by the constant k, which is a parameter in the differential equation governing the system. The transformations f(x) and g(x) applied to x(t) affect its representation but do not change the fundamental dynamics dictated by the original differential equation.",
