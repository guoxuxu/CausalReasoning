  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\), the integration and exponential factors involved could have significantly altered the trajectory from the initial state. The system's dependence on past states integrated over time complicates backtracking to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) uniquely.",
