  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relationship in a system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + M\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = N z \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) is applied which initially alters the state by converting space-domain information in z into frequency-domain.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) is performed on \\\\( z(x,0) \\\\) and it evolves according to the given differential equation, will \\\\( z(x,T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to allowing \\\\( z(x,0) \\\\) to evolve under the same conditions without applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) changes the representation of \\\\( z(x,0) \\\\) from space to frequency domain, thus altering the initial conditions under which the differential equation operates. The evolution path and the eventual state at time T will differ due to this transformation of initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
