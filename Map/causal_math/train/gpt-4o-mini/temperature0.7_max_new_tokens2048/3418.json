  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by a matrix \\( M \\) in a vector space and its effect on the vector \\( x \\). The transformation is then followed by an integral transformation represented by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\} \\), which is the Laplace transform of the vector function \\( x(t) \\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ Mx(t) \\} \\), can we always uniquely recover \\( x(t) \\) without knowing \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\( x(t) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ Mx(t) \\} \\) requires knowing \\( M \\), as \\( M \\) could be non-invertible or have nullifying effects on elements of \\( x(t) \\), obstructing unique recovery.",
