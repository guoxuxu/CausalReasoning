  "Problem": "Combining a Fourier transform with complex functions, consider a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transform given by \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} s(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\). Let the effect of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( s(t) \\\\) be defined as a multiplication by a fixed complex exponential, i.e., \\\\( L[s(t)] = e^{\\\\alpha t} s(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf another operation \\\\( M[s(t)] = e^{\\\\beta t} s(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex number, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant Fourier transform solely reflect the combined influence of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive application of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) results in a multiplication by \\\\( e^{(\\\\alpha + \\\\beta) t} \\\\). The Fourier transform will thus be shifted by the combined effect, resulting in the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega - \\\\alpha - \\\\beta) \\\\), showing the accumulated shift due to both operations.",
