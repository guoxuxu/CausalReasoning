  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + B\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + D\\\\), respectively. We investigate the behavior under the integral transform \\\\(T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nReverse causation: Can we unequivocally determine the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) throughout [0, T] by observing only the behavior of \\\\(T[z](t)\\\\) over time without knowing the differential equations for \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\(T[z](t)\\\\) leads to an overlap of effects through the integral of the exponentially scaled \\\\(z(s)\\\\), such that different functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) might result in the same transformed outcome. Without knowing the specific dynamics (differential equations), one can't deconvolve \\\\(T[z](t)\\\\) to retrieve \\\\(z(t)\\\\) uniquely.",
