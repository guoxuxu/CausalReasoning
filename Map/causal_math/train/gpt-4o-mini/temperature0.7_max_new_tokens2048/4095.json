  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is an operator. We examine the behavior under the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nIf a perturbation using another operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), changing the system to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = (L+M)u\\\\), will the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) be independent of the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\( M \\\\) changes the system dynamics starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the effects of the initial Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) may interact non-trivially with this new operator. As a result, both the initial transform and the interaction between \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) determine the state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
