  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore how different transformations influence this function, specifically transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different times.\n\nGiven observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we deduce whether \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) was applied, the observed state can result from various potentials, like different initial conditions or natural evolutions. The form and properties of \\\\( e^{e^{it}} \\\\) differ significantly from simply \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), making it challenging to discern the presence of \\\\( T_1 \\\\) transformation retrospectively.",
