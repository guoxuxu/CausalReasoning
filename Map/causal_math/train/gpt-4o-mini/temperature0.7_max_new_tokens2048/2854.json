  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral in the complex plane. We will evaluate the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt}dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed path and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number parameter. The analysis is affected by transformations using the function \\\\( f(z) = z^{2} + a \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nAfter computing \\\\( I \\\\) for given \\\\( t \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), is it possible to infer the original configuration of \\\\( C \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any changes to the contour that could vary the integral's value (such as transformations or modifications of residue locations) cannot be conclusively reversed. Multiple different contours could result in the same integral value, especially under transformation ambiguities.",
