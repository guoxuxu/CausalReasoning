  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a time-dependent input vector and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of introducing a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) over time t, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x(s) \\\\) before computing \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no transformation was applied to the inputs \\\\( x(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies \\\\( x(s) \\\\) by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{Bs} \\\\) at each instant s. This affects the integral computation by altering both the magnitude and orientation of the input within the integral. The result is a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\), as the dynamics introduced by B have a compounded effect over time on \\\\( x(s) \\\\) before they are integrated.",
