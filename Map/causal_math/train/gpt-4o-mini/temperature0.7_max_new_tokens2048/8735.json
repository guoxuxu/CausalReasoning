  "Problem": "Examine a linear system under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) and H is a constant matrix. This system is further affected by the application of a second function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention with function \\\\( q(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on H and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The state at T depends on the interactions among H, D, and F due to their influence on the trajectories of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\). Since \\\\( q(x) \\\\) translates to another transformation on \\\\( z \\\\) when combined with the effects of D and H, these matrices' properties will collectively determine the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
