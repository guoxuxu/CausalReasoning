  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) which describes the heat distribution in a rod over time. We also examine a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) which transforms the heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an external heat source changes the distribution at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by altering \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend strictly on the heat equation constant \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the characteristics of the heat source?",
  "Explanation": "The external heat source adds or alters heat distribution in the rod, which in turn affects the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The type and strength of the heat source intervention directly influence the future distribution of heat, alongside the diffusion properties determined by \\\\( k \\\\).",
