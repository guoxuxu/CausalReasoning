  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) with a boundary condition u(0) = 0. Analyze its behavior under the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = u(x) e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = u(x) e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve without further external intervention, will \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at t = T satisfy the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation applies an exponentially decaying factor in time, which modifies the original time-independent PDE. The factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\) introduces a term when differentiated that is not present in the original equation, thus altering the governed behavior of the PDE.",
