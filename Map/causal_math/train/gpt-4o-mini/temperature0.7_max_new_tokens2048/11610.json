  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane function defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{f(z)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) and a, b, c are complex numbers. Investigate the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = dz + e \\\\) on z, where d and e are also complex numbers, on the mapping of the function w.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the value \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at any point z without knowing if transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The modification introduced by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the input to \\\\( w(z) \\\\) significantly due to the non-linear nature of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is fundamentally ambiguous, given the transformation may not be invertible in this setup.",
