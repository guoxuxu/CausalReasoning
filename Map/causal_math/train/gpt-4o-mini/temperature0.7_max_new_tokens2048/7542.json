  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\cdot x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a fixed complex vector, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number. The function governs the time evolution in a complex function space and represents a circular motion in the complex plane. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(T) = e^{i \\omega T} \\cdot x \\\\), multiple vectors \\\\( x \\\\) could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the exponential term, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing the exact initial phase.",
