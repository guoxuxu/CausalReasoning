  "Problem": "Let's examine a complex function scenario given by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces a unit circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We are interested in the effect of a transformation using another function, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied to this time-varying function.\n\nGiven the trajectory at time T, can we uniquely identify whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both were applied at any point up until time T, solely based on the observed outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to before, the transformations \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) = z^3 \\\\) alter the trajectory in non-linear, periodic manners which, when combined, could result in overlapping effects. Different combinations of these transformations at different points in time could lead to the same observed trajectory at T, making it impossible to backtrack the exact sequence of applications.",
