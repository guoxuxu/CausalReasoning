  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. This function is used in transformations of signals in a system described by the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} h(t)z(t) dt \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being the system's impulse response.\n\nIf an additional filtering process \\\\( F(z) = p(t)z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is another function, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the endpoint output at time \\\\( T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) exclusively depend on the original system response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filtering process \\\\( F(z) \\\\) modifies the input signal by introducing \\\\( p(t) \\\\), affecting the subsequent output. Therefore, the output at time \\\\( T \\\\) depends not only on \\\\( h(t) \\\\), but also significantly on the introduced function \\\\( p(t) \\\\).",
