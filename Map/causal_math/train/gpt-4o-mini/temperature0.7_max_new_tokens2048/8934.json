  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a continuous function. The transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) is explored, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) as \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the specific transformation parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given only \\\\( G(s) = F(s-a) \\\\), it’s impossible to uniquely determine both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) without additional information. The translation property in the s-domain does not allow for the recovery of \\\\( a \\\\) or the specific form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) independently.",
