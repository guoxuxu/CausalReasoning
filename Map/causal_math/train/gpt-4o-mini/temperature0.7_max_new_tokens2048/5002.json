  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + a u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x, t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-ks} u(x, s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\) for some T > 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T[u] \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\) integrates the effects of the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) over time with an exponential weighting. As this blending obscures direct characteristics of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\), it's not possible to uniquely regress to the initial condition without knowledge of whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied.",
