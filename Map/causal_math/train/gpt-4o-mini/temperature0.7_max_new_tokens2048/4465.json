  "Problem": "Consider a function described by a complex form \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the complex variable z, respectively. Let \\\\( u(t) = e^{-t}cos(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t}sin(t) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied defined as \\\\( T(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with a complex parameter s.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) at time T = 1, and then allowed to evolve further without intervention up to a final time \\\\( T_2 > T_1 \\\\) under the assumption \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), will the resultant transformed function at \\\\( T_2 \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) at \\\\( T_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) alters the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the integral operation and the complex exponential factor, which essentially modifies the frequency components and decays the signal over time. This change in the transformation upon re-application will result in a different output.",
