  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We introduce a transformation \\\\(T(x) = Mx\\\\) where \\\\(M\\\\) is also a matrix that modifies the system prior to solving for \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(x'\\\\) from the transformed system \\\\(AMx = b\\\\), can we determine the original input \\\\(x\\\\) in the system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without knowing \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation matrix \\\\(M\\\\), it is impossible to definitively trace back \\\\(x'\\\\) to the original \\\\(x\\\\). The transformation could have altered the dimensions or the dependency relations in the vector space.",
