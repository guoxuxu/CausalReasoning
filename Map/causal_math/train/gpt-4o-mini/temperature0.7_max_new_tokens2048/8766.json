  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapped to a vector field by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is studied on the plane transformed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be deduced after observing \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the transformed complex plane affects the action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), altering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into multiple possible states before \\\\( g(z) \\\\) acts on it. Given \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\), multiple possible \\\\( z_0 \\\\) forms could exist due to the non-linearity and complexity of the transformations.",
