  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output signal \\( z(t) \\) is determined by applying a Laplace transform \\( L \\) to an input signal \\( x(t) \\). The transfer function in the Laplace domain is given by \\( H(s) = \\frac{s + a}{s + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention by applying a different modulation \\( n(t) \\) is made, resulting in \\( L(n(t) z(t)) = N(s)Z(s) \\) at \\( t > t_1 \\), will the final output \\( Z_f(s) \\) depend on \\( N(s) \\) and not be determined purely by \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\( n(t) \\) introduces a new variable \\( N(s) \\) which modulates the already transformed output \\( Z(s) \\). Hence, the final output \\( Z_f(s) \\) is now \\( H(s)M(s)N(s)X(s) \\), clearly affected by \\( N(s) \\), and thus not determined solely by \\( H(s) \\).",
