  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the following operator equation \\( \\mathcal{L}(x) = D^2x + 2x \\) where \\( D \\) represents the differential operator with respect to variable \\( t \\). Assess how the introduction of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) modifies the system.\n\nIf the system is subjected to an additional transformation \\( \\mathcal{G}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-pt}x(t) \\, dt \\) at \\( t_1 > 0 \\), will the subsequent behavior of \\( x(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) be independent of the initial Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) as a new transformation combines with the effects of the existing Laplace transformation (if it was applied). The interplay between \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) can result in a composite transformation effect, which makes the behavior of \\( x(t) \\) dependent on both.",
