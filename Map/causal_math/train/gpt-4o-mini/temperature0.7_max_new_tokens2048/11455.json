  "Problem": "Consider a function system described by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. This system undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( I(w) = \\\\int w(z) dz \\\\) applied over a certain path in the complex plane.\n\nIf an additional operation \\\\( w(z) = e^{Bz}w(z) \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is a new complex constant) is applied mid-way through the integration process, will the result of \\\\( I(w) \\\\) still only depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the operation \\\\( e^{Bz}w(z) \\\\) modifies the expression for the function being integrated, introducing dependence on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The final result of \\\\( I(w) \\\\) would now incorporate effects from both constants, significantly influencing the trajectory and outcome of the integral transformation.",
