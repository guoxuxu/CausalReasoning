  "Problem": "Assume a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform on this function over the variable t.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a certain time t1 to change the frequency from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), upon taking the Laplace transform, does the resultant function at s still reflect only the initial frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Therefore, the new Laplace transform will reflect this new frequency yielding \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega'} \\\\). As a result, the transform will contain information about the modified frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not just the initial \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
