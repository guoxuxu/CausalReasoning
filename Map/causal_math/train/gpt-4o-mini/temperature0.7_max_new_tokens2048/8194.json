  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex number. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) transforms the system at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it’s uncertain if the transformation \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) influenced the initial state. Without this information, multiple original states \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could lead to the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially if \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) are not aligned.",
