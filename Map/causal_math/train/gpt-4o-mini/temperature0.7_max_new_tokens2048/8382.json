  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) is defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix, impacts the system over a period of time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the input complex number \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), it's impossible to backtrack the initial conditions exactly due to the transformation potentially altering the trajectory in a way that is not reversible, especially because the matrix exponential may skew or rotate the positions in the complex plane.",
