  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to the function, which then defines a new function \\\\( Z(s) = L\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\), is it possible to uniquely identify that the originating function was exclusively \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any other additive functions present?",
  "Explanation": "The unique inferability comes from the properties of the Laplace transform, which is a one-to-one transformation for exponential functions without additive components. The form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\) specifically corresponds to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) with no ambiguities.",
