  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) in the complex plane, representing circular motion with unit radius and angular velocity of 1 radian per unit time. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), particularly focusing on the Laplace transform for different values of the complex variable s.\n\nGiven the new Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after the frequency shift intervention, can we determine precisely and uniquely the value of the intervention parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) just by analyzing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The shift in frequency directly modifies how the exponentials in the Laplace transform integrate, thereby affecting the poles and zeros of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Analyzing these changes allows for the determination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), thus identifying the intervention's magnitude precisely.",
