  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\). We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) over time t, where k is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the differential equation. Since \\\\( g(z_0) = e^{kT}z_0 \\\\), this scaling factor changes the trajectory of the solution, leading to a different complex number at time T compared to the unaltered trajectory.",
