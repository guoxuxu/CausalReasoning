  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, under the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\). The transformation is considered at two intervals: initially at time t = 0 and after applying an intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\).\n\nGiven the frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after an intervention, can you determine whether the intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\) was applied at t = T/2 only by observing the frequency spectrum at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum at t = T may show a disrupted or altered profile depending on various factors including the nature and timing of the intervention. Solely based on the frequency spectrum at t = T, it is impossible to confirm the specific intervention type and timing due to potential overlap with other influences or multiple feasible spectra resulting from different interventions.",
