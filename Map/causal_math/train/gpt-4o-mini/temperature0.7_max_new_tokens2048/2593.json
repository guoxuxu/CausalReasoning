  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\), where \\\\(w(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\) over a variable t, with z as a complex variable. The function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed via another function \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\). Analyze the impact of transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to \\\\(g(t)\\\\) on the complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed to \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(z)\\\\) is computed subsequently without any further adjustments, will \\\\(w(z)\\\\) take the form of \\\\(w_{new}(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} t^2 e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to \\\\(g(t)\\\\) alters the integral operation within the complex function. Specifically, \\\\(w(z)\\\\) will be computed using the new function \\\\(g(t)\\\\), which by definition is \\\\(t^2 f(t)\\\\). This directly modifies the integrand, resulting in the form \\\\(\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} t^2 e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\) for \\\\(w(z)\\\\).",
