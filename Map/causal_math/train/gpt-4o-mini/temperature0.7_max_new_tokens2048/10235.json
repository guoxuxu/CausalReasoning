  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore how different transformations influence this function, specifically transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different times.\n\nIf a different transformation, \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), is applied at any time t1 (0 < t1 < T), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the original function e^{it} and not on the transformation \\\\( T_1 \\\\) or \\\\( T_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( T_2(z) \\\\) further alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) now depends on the effects of both transforms. The square of any complex number (from \\\\( T_2 \\\\)) amplifies and changes the trajectory established by any prior transformation \\\\( T_1 \\\\), resulting in a state that reflects both influences.",
