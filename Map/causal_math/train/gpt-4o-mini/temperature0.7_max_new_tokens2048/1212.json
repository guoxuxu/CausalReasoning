  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). To further analyze or manipulate the signal, an operator \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied in the frequency domain.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x''(t) \\\\), the inverse Fourier Transform of \\\\( Q(\\\\omega)P(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine what specific operations represented by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal \\\\( x''(t) \\\\) is an amalgamation of transformations by both \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\). These operations could overlap or mask each other’s effects, making it impossible to precisely discern what transformations were applied to \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) from the resultant \\\\( x''(t) \\\\).",
