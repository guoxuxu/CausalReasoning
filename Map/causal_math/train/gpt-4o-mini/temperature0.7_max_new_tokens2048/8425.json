  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency of oscillation in radians per second. This defines a system where \\( z(t) \\) traces a circular path in the complex plane. Investigate the impact of a linear transformation \\( L(z) = Az + b \\) with complex constants A and b.\n\nIf the transformation \\( L(z) \\) is applied to \\( z_0 = z(0) \\) and then \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve under the original system \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) without further intervention, will the resulting path \\( z(t) \\) be the same as the path if it was untransformed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( L(z) \\) will modify the initial complex number by scaling and translating it, hence altering its trajectory in the complex plane. The new trajectory will follow \\( L(e^{i \\omega t}) = A e^{i \\omega t} + b \\), which represents a different circle or spiral depending on the values of A and b.",
