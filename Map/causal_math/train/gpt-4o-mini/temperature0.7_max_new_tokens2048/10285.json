  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the stability of a linear system defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) multiplies an initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) without further intervention, will the evolved state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be the direct multiplication of \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) with the state that would evolve from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying the initial condition by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) implies that the phase of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is changed, which modifies how the system evolves under A. Due to the properties of matrix exponentials and complex multiplication, the resulting state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is affected both by A and the initial modification, not just a direct application of \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) to the unmodified evolution.",
