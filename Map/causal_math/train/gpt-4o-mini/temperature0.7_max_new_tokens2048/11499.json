  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where an input signal \\( x(t) \\) is passed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution with an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). The transformed signal \\( y(t) \\) is then subjected to a Fourier transform, generating \\( Y(\\omega) \\).\n\nIf an additional filtering operation \\( g(t) \\) is implemented as an intervention at time \\( \\tau \\), does the final representation \\( Y(\\omega) \\) still only depend on \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\), not on \\( g(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another filter \\( g(t) \\) at \\( \\tau \\) modifies the system's characteristics. The output then becomes the convolution of \\( x(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\), and \\( g(t) \\), affecting the spectral content \\( Y(\\omega) \\). The final Fourier transform \\( Y(\\omega) \\) will incorporate effects from \\( G(\\omega) \\), the transform of \\( g(t) \\).",
