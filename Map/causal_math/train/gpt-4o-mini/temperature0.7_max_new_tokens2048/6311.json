  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by an integral transform \\\\( L[u(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation. Suppose we introduce a perturbation function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + p(x) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional modification \\\\( q(x) \\\\) is applied after time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), modifying \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + q(x) \\\\), will the transformed outcome \\\\( L[w(x)] \\\\) still reflect the actions of both \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\), or just depend on \\\\( L[u(x)] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of \\\\( L \\\\) implies that \\\\( L[w(x)] = L[u(x)] + L[p(x)] + L[q(x)] \\\\). Thus, both the actions of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) are reflected in the final transformation, adding to the output from \\\\( L[u(x)] \\\\).",
