  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The scenario evaluates the impact of modifying this function through an integral transform, specifically a Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) valid for \\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation is applied to modify the frequency from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\\\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and then the function is subjected to the Laplace transform, will the resultant Laplace transform reflect only the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not the modified frequency?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention altered the frequency in the function prior to the application of the Laplace transform, and this change will be reflected in the resultant transform as a pole at \\\\( s = i2\\\\omega \\\\), indicating a dependence on the new frequency.",
