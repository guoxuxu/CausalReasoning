  "Problem": "Consider a closed curve C in the complex plane and a function f(z) which is holomorphic inside and on C, except for isolated singularities inside C. We examine the effect of applying the contour integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_C f(z) dz \\\\) which computes the residues of the function at its singularities.\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\( g(f) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the function f(z) and its singularities inside C without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral provides the sum of residues at singularities, but it doesn't provide information on the nature of these singularities (poles of what order, or other singular forms) or other aspects of the function f(z). Multiple different functions can have the same set of residues leading to the same integral result.",
