  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of an external force applied to a mechanical system obeying the second order differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The system is subject to an impulse response represented as a transformation \\\\(g(x) = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are matrices and u denotes the control input.\n\nIf \\\\(g(x)\\\\) is applied initially at time t = 0, followed by the system's natural response under \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\\\) with no further intervention, will the system's state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(g(x)\\\\) had not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(x)\\\\) changes the initial conditions by setting a new starting point for x, potentially modifying the trajectory of the system. Given that the transformation introduces a non-natural modification to the system, the eventual state at time T will differ from the trajectory without application of \\\\(g(x)\\\\).",
