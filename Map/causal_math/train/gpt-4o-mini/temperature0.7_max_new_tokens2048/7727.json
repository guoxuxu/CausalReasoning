  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a constant complex vector. We are interested in evaluating the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) is applied at a specific time during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) introduces a dependency on B along with A due to the integration involving \\\\( e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) \\\\). This transformation affects the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) relies on both A and B.",
