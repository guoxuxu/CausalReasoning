  "Problem": "Examine a linear system under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) and H is a constant matrix. This system is further affected by the application of a second function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 = Hx_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly transformed to t = T under \\\\( z = Hx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) initially changes the state of \\\\( z \\\\) from \\\\( Hx_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Dt}Hx_0 \\\\), altering the evolution trajectory of the system. Because D could fundamentally interact with H to create a distinct state at any later time T, the path and resulting state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ from not applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
