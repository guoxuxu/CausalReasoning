  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Let's define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nGiven the function at some endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for equivalent effects from different combinations of frequency shifts and rotations, it is impossible to uniquely determine which specific transformation or combinations thereof were applied. This is compounded by the complex interactions between phase shifts that can lead to the same final outcome.",
