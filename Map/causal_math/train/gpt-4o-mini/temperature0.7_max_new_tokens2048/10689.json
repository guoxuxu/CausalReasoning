  "Problem": "Evaluate the relationship between a Fourier transform given by the equation \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) and its impact on the system's behavior described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + a\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + bu = f(t) \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf a signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) undergoes a modification via its Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) \\\\) initially, and then the system evolves according to the given differential equation without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at any time t directly reflect the transformations applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) must account for all transformations to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), since the differential equation explicitly depends on \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The Fourier transform adjusts the frequency components of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), which directly influences the behavior of the solution through the equation's dependence on \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
