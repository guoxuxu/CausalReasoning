  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. The system's behavior is further explored through the application of a transformation represented by \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) alters the initial state in ways that are not necessarily reversible or determinable without explicit knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and its application, leading to an indeterminate original state.",
