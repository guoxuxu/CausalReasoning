  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We analyze how the integral transformation \\\\(X(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, influences the state over time.\n\nIf an operational change alters \\\\(C\\\\) to a different matrix \\\\(D\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), hence altering the trajectory to \\\\(z(t) = De^{A(t-t_1)}z(t_1)\\\\), will \\\\(X(T)\\\\), for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), solely depend on \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in matrix from \\\\(C\\\\) to \\\\(D\\\\) introduces another vector of influence altering both the instantaneous and accumulated state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). Therefore, \\\\(X(T)\\\\) will reflect the contributions of \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and the change induced by \\\\(D\\\\), not just \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\).",
