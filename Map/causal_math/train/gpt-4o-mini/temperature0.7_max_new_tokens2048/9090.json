  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} e^{zt} dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the implication of perturbing the variable \\\\( z \\\\) through a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z + w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( z \\\\) input without knowing whether \\\\( G(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of exponential and integral transforms in complex analysis, multiple values could yield the same or indistinguishable results, especially without knowing the application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\). The nonlinear transformation further complicates backward tracing of the input.",
