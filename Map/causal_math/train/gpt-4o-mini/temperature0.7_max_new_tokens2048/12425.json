  "Problem": "Given the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit, we examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\), can we uniquely determine the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the original function \\( z(t) \\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The poles of the Laplace transform, such as \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\), directly indicate the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the sinusoidal function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). The location of the pole in the complex plane \\( s = i\\omega \\) provides the precise value of \\( \\omega \\).",
