  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact through a Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\( F(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real-valued angular frequency, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) for a range of \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we perfectly reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under proper conditions. Hence, from \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\), the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be perfectly reconstructed using the inverse Fourier transform, assuming the transform encompasses all necessary frequency components.",
