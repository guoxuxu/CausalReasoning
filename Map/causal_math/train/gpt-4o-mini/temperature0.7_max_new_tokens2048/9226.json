  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with time evolution defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An operator transformation given by \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention.\n\nCan the initial state \\\\( y_0 \\\\) be deduced exactly from the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) was applied, it’s impossible to reliably determine whether the observed \\\\( y(T) \\\\) resulted from \\\\( y_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Cy_0 \\\\). The potential application of \\\\( C \\\\) renders the deduction of \\\\( y_0 \\\\) ambiguous unless additional information about \\\\( C \\\\) or its application is known.",
