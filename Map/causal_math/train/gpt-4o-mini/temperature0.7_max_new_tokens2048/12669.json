  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) of \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\), followed by its evolution in time is analyzed.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) at some time t, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) if we do not know whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), any effects seen at time t in the system may arise from either a transformed or non-transformed initial state. The Fourier transform fundamentally alters the spectral composition of the initial condition, making reconstruction ambiguous without this crucial information.",
