  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( F(z_1, z_2) \\\\) where \\\\( z_1, z_2 \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of different contour deformations in the complex plane when computing the contour integral of \\\\( F \\\\).\n\nGiven the value of the integral of \\\\( F(z_1, z_2) \\\\) along some contour, can we determine the specific shape of the original contour used?",
  "Explanation": "The integral value, particularly if it does not enclose different poles during deformation, does not uniquely identify the shape of the contour. Multiple contours adhering to the conditions of Cauchy's theorem can result in the same integral value; thus, knowing only the integral value does not provide information about the specific initial contour shape.",
