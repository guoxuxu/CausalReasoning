  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We investigate the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\( M \\), which acts on the complex plane by the function \\( f(z) = Mz \\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the matrix \\( M \\) to \\( N \\) at some point and then \\( g(z) \\) is applied, will the function \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) still only depend on the original matrix \\( M \\) and not \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the matrix from \\( M \\) to \\( N \\) represents a new transformation \\( f'(z) = Nz \\) which, when applied before \\( g(z) \\), results in a different value due to \\( g(f'(z_0)) = e^{iNz_0} \\). As such, the outcome will depend on both \\( M \\) and \\( N \\), affecting the ultimate behavior of the exponential function.",
