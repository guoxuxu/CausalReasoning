  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We examine the interactions between the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and a linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) on function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the final state of the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions, like \\( L \\) or \\( M \\), were used, based solely on the Fourier transform at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform outcome could result from varying degrees and combinations of interventions due to the complexity introduced by applying different operators such as \\( L \\) and \\( M \\). The non-trivial interaction between these operators and their parameters can yield similar spectral characteristics, making it impossible to infer the exact interventions uniquely.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) causes a rotation in the complex plane, which influences its Fourier Transform. The linear operator L modifies z(t), leading to an altered output that impacts the final state. Similarly, the operator M also modifies z(t) and affects the Fourier Transform. The variable t affects the application of L to the function f(t). The constant ω determines the nature of the rotation in the complex plane.",
