  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature \\( T \\) across a rod varies over time and can be described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution as \\( f(T) = T_0 + h \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) where \\( T_0 \\) is the initial uniform temperature, \\( h \\) is the amplitude, and \\( \\\\omega \\) the frequency of the heat variation.\n\nIf \\( f(T) \\) sets the initial temperature distribution and the system evolves according to the heat equation without further alteration, will the temperature distribution at a later time \\( t = T \\) replicate the initial pattern introduced by \\( f(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the diffusion nature of the heat equation, the initial sinusoidal variation introduced by \\( f(T) \\) will diminish over time. The temperature distribution will tend to become uniform, with variations decreasing as \\( t \\) increases.",
