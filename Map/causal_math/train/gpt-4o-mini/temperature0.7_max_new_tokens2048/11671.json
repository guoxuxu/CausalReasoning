  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is first transformed via a Fourier transform, generating \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), and is then processed by a system with a frequency response function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). The output is \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and it undergoes an inverse Fourier transform to produce the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), by altering the system's response at that frequency, will this affect the overall form of the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the system's response at specific frequencies directly affects the processed signal \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) \\\\), consequently altering the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after the inverse Fourier transformation, showing how sensitive the output is to frequency-specific interventions.",
