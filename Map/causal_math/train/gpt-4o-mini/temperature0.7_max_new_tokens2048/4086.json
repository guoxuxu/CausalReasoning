  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) which is derived as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - A} \\\\), where A represents a constant. The system is studied under a Heaviside step function input \\\\( u(t) = 1(t) \\\\) converted into the Laplace domain to form \\\\( U(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\). The output in the Laplace domain is then \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at a certain transformed frequency s, can we uniquely determine the value of A in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - A} \\\\) assuming no other system information is manipulated or interfered with?",
  "Explanation": "While you can infer properties of A if \\\\( H(s) \\\\) typology is known, there could exist multiple values of A that produce the same output characteristics under specific conditions of s or congenial transformations of input, making it non-unique without additional system specifics.",
