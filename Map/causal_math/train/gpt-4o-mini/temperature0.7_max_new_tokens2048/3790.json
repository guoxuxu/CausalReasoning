  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a complex constant, and its application in an integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We investigate how changes in the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) influence the transformation output.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( F(s) \\\\) for a particular value of \\\\( s \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function parameter \\\\( c \\\\) without knowing the initial value of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\) initially used in the transformation, multiple values of \\\\( c \\\\) might correspond to similar shapes or magnitudes in the resulting function \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The integral's sensitivity to the phase and growth rate induced by \\\\( c \\\\) needs precise knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\) for accurate back-calculation.",
