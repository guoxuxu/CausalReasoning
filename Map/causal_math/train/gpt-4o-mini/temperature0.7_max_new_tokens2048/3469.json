  "Problem": "Consider a complex integration scenario described by a contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\) around a closed path C in the complex plane, where \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to analyze the integral in terms of real time dynamics.\n\nIf the parameter \\\\(a\\\\) in the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is increased, without any intervention, does this lead to a significant change in the value of the contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\(a\\\\) directly modifies the exponential part of the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\), which alters the growth rate and behavior of the integrand along the contour C. This change will affect the residues at the poles and consequently the value of the integral due to changes in the exponential decay or growth rate, as influenced by the Laplace transform properties.",
