  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = pz' + qz \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants and \\\\( z' \\\\) is the derivative of \\\\( z \\\\) with respect to time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve without further transformation, will the value of \\\\( Lz(t) \\\\) at any time t = T be dependent solely on the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( Lz(t) = pz' + qz \\\\) involves both the function itself and its derivative, the outcome at any time t = T will depend on both the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and its rate of change at the outset, not solely on \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The dynamics introduced by the derivative component \\\\( z' \\\\) ensure that the overall transformation at any given point is influenced by preceding values and changes, not just the initial condition.",
