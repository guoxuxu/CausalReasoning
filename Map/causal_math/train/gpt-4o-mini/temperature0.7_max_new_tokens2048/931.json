  "Problem": "We examine the stability and effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T_w [f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-wt} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf at a specific value \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we modify \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct} \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another complex constant) and apply \\\\( T_w \\\\), will the outcome be solely influenced by function \\\\( A \\\\) and not by \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) meaning the outcome of \\\\( T_w \\\\) now depends critically on \\\\( C \\\\) as well as \\\\( A \\\\). The transformation is sensitive to the changes in the function it acts upon, leading to outcomes affected by both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
