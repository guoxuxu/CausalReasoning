  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the behavior of the transformed function under a translation operation in the time domain, i.e., \\\\( g(t) = f(t-a) \\\\) with a positive a, represented by \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation, represented by multiplying the original transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( e^{-bs} \\\\), is introduced after the initial shift, will the new transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) represent the Laplace transform of the function resulting from both transformations applied consecutively?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the additional transformation by multiplying the already shifted transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) equals \\\\( e^{-bs} e^{-as}F(s) = e^{-(a+b)s}F(s) \\\\). This correctly represents the Laplace transform of the function initially shifted by \\\\( a \\\\) then further by \\\\( b \\\\), confirming that consecutive shifts add together in the transform domain.",
