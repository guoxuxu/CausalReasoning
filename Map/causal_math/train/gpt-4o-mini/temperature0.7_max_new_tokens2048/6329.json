  "Problem": "Let's analyze a control system with state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) whose dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px + Qu \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We observe the effect when transforming the state by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the state evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px + Qu \\\\) without any change in control input, will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) had been directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px + Qu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) alters the initial condition by multiplying by \\\\( e^{M0} \\\\) which is the identity matrix and thus remains \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The state trajectory is modified to begin at a new initial state \\\\( e^{M0}x_0 \\\\), influencing the subsequent evolution under the dynamics prescribed by \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\). Even though \\\\( e^{M0} = I \\\\), the principle holds for any non-zero \\\\( t \\\\).",
