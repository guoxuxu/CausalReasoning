  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\), where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of implementing a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) on x(t) and then applying an inverse Fourier transform to observe the effects on the evolution of x(t) over time.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention involving an additional function \\( g(x) = Bx(t) \\) (where B is a different constant matrix) is applied to \\( x(t) \\), will the end state \\( x(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend uniquely on A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\( g(x) \\) significantly alters the trajectory of the system by introducing a new dynamic component represented by the matrix B. Hence, the final state \\( x(T) \\) will depend on both matrices A and B, revealing the influence of the intervention.",
