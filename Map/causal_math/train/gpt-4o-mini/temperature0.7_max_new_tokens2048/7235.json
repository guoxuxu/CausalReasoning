  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\(\\{ z(t) \\}\\) that maps complex numbers onto a complex plane. The function is defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(z) = e^{i \\theta t}z \\) (where \\( \\theta \\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( \\alpha \\) or \\( \\theta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(z) \\) introduces an additional rotating factor, affecting not just the magnitude but also the phase of \\( z \\) over time. Thus, the final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\omega \\), and \\( \\theta \\), as both the initial transformation and the intervention influence the trajectory and final state in the complex plane.",
