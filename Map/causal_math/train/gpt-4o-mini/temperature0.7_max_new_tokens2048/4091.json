  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az + B\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1 > 0\\\\), an intervention \\\\(U(z) = Dz + E\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(E\\\\) are also complex constants, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), or \\\\(E\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(U(z)\\\\) introduces additional transformation dependent on \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(E\\\\), affecting the trajectory and final state of the system. Thus, the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will depend on all constants \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\), since both transformations can scale, shift, or otherwise modify the trajectory.",
