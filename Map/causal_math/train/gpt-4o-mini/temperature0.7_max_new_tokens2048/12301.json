  "Problem": "In a control system analysis, the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) acts on a state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. We explore the changes in state space when applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) at different points in time t.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t=0 confidently without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes non-trivial as the transformation by \\\\( e^{tC} \\\\) can significantly alter the initial conditions. Moreover, the non-reversible nature of matrix exponentiation with unknown C complicates the recovery of initial states.",
