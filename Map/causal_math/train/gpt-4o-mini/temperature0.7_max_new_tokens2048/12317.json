  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} - ci \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are real constants.\n\nFrom observing the final function at \\\\( t = T \\\\) having applied \\\\( D \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the differential operator adding a complex component, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could correspond to various initial conditions due to the phase modification introduced by \\\\( -ci \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\). The modifications obscure the original conditions unless exactly knowing all operator components and initial phase.",
