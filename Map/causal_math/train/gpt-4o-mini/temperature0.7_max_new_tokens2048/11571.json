  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = L(h(t))  = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). We analyze the effect of modifying this system by convolution with another function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(t) = e^{ct} \\\\) is convolved as an intervention, will the resulting function's Laplace transform at s, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), depend only on the original Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and not on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( K(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening convolution with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) further modifies the system, introducing an additional factor that influences the final Laplace transform. The result, \\\\( Z(s) = H(s-b-c) \\\\), depends on the original transform as well as the modifications introduced by both convolutions, reflecting the shifts introduced by \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\).",
