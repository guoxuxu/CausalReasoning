  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), representing a Laplace transform of a time-domain function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). We explore how applying an integral transformation and its inverse affects our ability to infer causal relationships in the transformed domain.\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes the transformation to become \\\\( z(s) \\\\) through the Laplace transformation, and then \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is directly used without further transformation, will the inverse Laplace transform yield the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse form a bijective pair for functions meeting certain reasonable conditions (e.g., piecewise continuity and exponential boundedness), ensuring that the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) can be perfectly reconstructed from its image \\\\( z(s) \\\\) under these conditions.",
