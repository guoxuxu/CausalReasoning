  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time t according to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) be exclusively determined by observing the output of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involving integral and exponential components makes it practically impossible to reverse-engineer the original function without explicit knowledge of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) being applied, due to the cumulative and integrative effect over the entire history of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
