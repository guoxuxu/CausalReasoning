  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a variable transformation using a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) on the integration path in the complex plane. Given a continuous function g(z), we examine the integral transformation from the function \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over a specific path P to \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over the same path.\n\nCan the original integral \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over path P be recovered accurately after observing only the transformed integral \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) without knowing the function f?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to revert \\\\( g(f(z))f'(z) \\\\) accurately to \\\\( g(z) \\\\) since different transformations could yield similar changes in integration outcomes, obscuring the original function and path characteristics.",
