  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(t) =  ∫_0^t e^{st} h(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given function. We study how changes in \\\\( h(s) \\\\) influence the graph of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) given that \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( z''(T) \\\\), can we accurately identify the precise moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\) when the intervention started?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact start time of the intervention from just the endpoint observation under the non-trivial dynamics of integral transformations is challenging. Changes might propagate in a manner that doesn't distinctly mark the commencement of the transformation, thereby obscuring the precise moment of intervention.",
