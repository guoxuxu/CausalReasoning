  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BdW \\\\), where \\\\( W(t) \\\\) is a standard Brownian motion and A, B are matrices. Let's analyze the influence of a deterministic control policy \\\\( u(t) = Ce^{Dt}X(t) \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices integrated over a time interval.\n\nApplying a deterministic control policy \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from time \\\\( 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), does the final state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) depend solely on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and not on the matrices C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( u(t) = Ce^{Dt}X(t) \\\\) modifies the system dynamics, contributing an additional deterministic component based on the matrices \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) to the solution. The evolution under \\\\( A \\\\) and additional influence of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) imply that the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) depends on all these matrices.",
