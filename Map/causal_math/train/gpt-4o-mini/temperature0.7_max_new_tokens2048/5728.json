  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions. The transformation involves the application of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier transform output \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) measured after an unknown intervention, can we determine precisely what the intervention was?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform provides the frequency content of the signal but does not inherently encode specific information about the nature of time-domain interventions uniquely. Multiple different alterations could result in the same frequency spectrum, leading to ambiguity in identifying the exact intervention.",
