  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function defines wave-like motion in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied to study its effect.\n\nIf an intervention using the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the resulting function value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When \\\\( T \\\\) is applied as an intervention, the resulting transformed function up to time T significantly depends on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\), involving the integration with \\\\( e^{iB\\\\tau} \\\\), introduces dependency on \\\\( B \\\\) and modifies how \\\\( z \\\\) evolves post-intervention.",
