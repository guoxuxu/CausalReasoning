  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = te^{-t} \\\\). We further explore the role of inverse transformations and additional operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we uniquely determine \\\\(f(t)\\\\) as the cause once we know \\\\(G(s)\\\\) without additional data about the system?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\(G(s) = sF(s)\\\\) allows for the determination of \\\\(F(s)\\\\) by simple algebraic manipulation (division by s). As long as \\\\(s \\\\neq 0\\\\), we can recover \\\\(F(s)\\\\) and subsequently apply the inverse Laplace transformation to uniquely determine \\\\(f(t)\\\\).",
