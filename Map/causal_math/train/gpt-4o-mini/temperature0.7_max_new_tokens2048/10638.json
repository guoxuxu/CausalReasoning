  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex system where the temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The system undergoes an intervention where for \\( t \\geq t_0 \\), an external source \\( S(x,t) = A e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) (where \\( A \\) and \\( \\\\omega \\) are constants) heats the system.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\( T(x,T) \\) at a later time \\( T \\), can we precisely deduce the initial condition \\( T_0(x) \\) if no external heat source was applied?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of an external source, the heat equation governs the dynamics purely diffusively. Thus, knowing \\( T(x,T) \\) allows for calculation backwards using the properties of the heat equation to uniquely determine \\( T_0(x) \\), assuming no other factors influence the system.",
