  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces out a unit circle in the complex plane over time. Analyze the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function modification \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\\\) is applied, and then \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is calculated continuously from 0 to T, does the output at time T depend solely on the initial function (\\\\( e^{it} \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to a new function, which will affect the integral transformation from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. Thus, the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T will be influenced by both the pre-intervention and post-intervention function forms, reflecting the compositional impact on the integrated outcome.",
