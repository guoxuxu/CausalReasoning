  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. Let us examine the impact of an integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, over the time interval [0, t].\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) starting at t = 0 and then evolves under \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\) without any further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) \\) changes the initial state by integrating over a transformed trajectory influenced by \\( D \\). This modified trajectory under the influence of both \\( D \\) and \\( C \\) leads to a state at time T that is different from pure evolution under \\( C \\).",
