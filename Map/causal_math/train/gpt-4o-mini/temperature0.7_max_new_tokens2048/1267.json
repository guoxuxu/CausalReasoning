  "Problem": "Let's consider the linear functional transformation \\\\( F(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a fixed but unknown function. We explore the consequences of applying \\\\( F(g) \\\\) to different functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) under continuous and piecewise mappings.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\) is introduced at some time as intervention, changing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + h(t) \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( F(g) \\\\) reflect changes determined only by the initial form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + h(t) \\\\) and consequently, \\\\( F(g(t) + h(t)) \\\\) involves interactions of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This alters the output, making it dependent on the original form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the new altered function.",
