  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_x^2 u \\\\), where D represents a diffusion constant. We also consider the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a wave number.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T(u)(x, T) \\\\) observed at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we recover the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovery of the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( T(u)(x, T) \\\\) is not feasible without precise knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\). The transformation effect due to \\\\( T(u) \\\\) on the evolution under the PDE can be intricate, involving Fourier components that may not readily reveal the exact initial state unless it's known that \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied.",
