  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a complex oscillation on the unit circle in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined for any function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention involves scaling \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( a \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number) at some time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will the Laplace transform of the new function always yield a real positive value for the real part of \\\\( s \\\\) being large?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling intervention on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modifies the function to \\\\( a e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this scaled version, for large values of the real part of \\\\( s \\\\), tends to zero due to the exponential term \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) dominating, hence the real part of the transform approaches zero, which is non-negative.",
