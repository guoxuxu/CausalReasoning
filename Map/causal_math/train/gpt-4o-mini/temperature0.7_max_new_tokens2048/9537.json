  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature (T) at any spatial point (x,y) in a region follows the heat equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We study the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the temperature distribution, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), and analyze its influence over time.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution T at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution at t = T follow the same evolution as an untransformed initial T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\) alters the initial condition in the frequency domain. Since the heat equation and its solutions depend heavily on the initial conditions, the transformation changes how the system evolves, resulting specifically in different frequency components dominating the evolution.",
