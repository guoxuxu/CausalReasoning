  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system's natural evolution without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the natural system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the complex number by inducing a rotation dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and t. This rotational factor alters the trajectory from what would have been if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) simply followed the natural system’s evolution. Thus, the state at t = T will differ due to this initial phase shift.",
