  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and not on the interventions (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) introduce additional factors affecting the state at time \\\\( t = T \\\\). Both modifications (square and addition) significantly impact the trajectory and the resultant output at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
