  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a vector space involving a matrix \\\\( P \\\\) representing a projection operator onto a subspace. Let us explore the changes in vectors under the operations defined by another matrix \\\\( Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is an orthogonal matrix representing a rotation.\n\nIf you observe a vector \\\\( w \\\\) after it has been transformed by possibly both \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\), can you uniquely determine the sequence of transformations (\\\\( P \\\\) then \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( Q \\\\) then \\\\( P \\\\)) that produced \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information, the final vector \\\\( w \\\\) does not carry enough information to uniquely determine the order of transformations. Both sequences could theoretically result in the same vector due to overlaps in the range and null spaces of the matrices.",
