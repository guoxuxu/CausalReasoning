  "Problem": "Investigate the effects of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, on a real variable system \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) under both normal evolution and perturbed conditions.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is only observed without altering the evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), will the knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influence the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is complex and oscillates on the unit circle in the complex plane, whereas \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) is solely dependent on real values of \\\\( t \\\\) and progresses independently of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Therefore, observing or not observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) does not affect the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
