  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) and we explore the functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\). We evaluate the behavior and causal inference scenarios of this function under various transformations and time periods.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(x_0) \\\\) at \\\\( x_0 \\\\) after observing the transformed state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) at \\\\( x = T \\\\) without knowing the interim transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which includes squaring the integral and adding one, significantly alters the function such that reconstructing the original \\\\( z(x_0) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) is not feasible without knowing what transformations have been applied in between. The square and addition mask the original values of \\\\( z \\\\).",
