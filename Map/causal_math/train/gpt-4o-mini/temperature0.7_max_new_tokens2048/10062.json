  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation, simplified to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\nu\\\\nabla^2u\\\\), where u is the velocity field, p is pressure, and ν is viscosity. Evaluate the behavior under a Fourier transform of the velocity field, represented as \\\\( F(u)(k) \\\\), where k is the wave number.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity field \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( F(u)(k, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing the Navier-Stokes dynamics precisely to retrieve \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F(u)(k, t) \\\\) is highly complex due to the turbulent and viscous nature of fluid flow, which can be sensitive to small variations in initial conditions. The lack of information on the initial Fourier transform further complicates the exact recovery of \\\\( u_0 \\\\).",
