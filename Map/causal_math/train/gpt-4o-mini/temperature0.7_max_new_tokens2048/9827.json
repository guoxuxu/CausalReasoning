  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\). For causal inference, analyze the impacts of altering \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) without and with interventions.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + n \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) at a specific moment, will the consequent function \\( f(t) \\) simply scale the exponential term \\( e^{at} \\) without altering the behavior of other components of \\( f(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that multiplies the \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) term by \\( n \\) will simply scale the corresponding term \\( e^{at} \\) by \\( n \\) in the time domain without altering other components of \\( f(t) \\). The Laplace Transform's linearity ensures that other terms remain unaffected.",
