  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) mapping real numbers to complex numbers. We explore the transformation driven by the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to this function resulting in \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), and analyze its impact under different conditions.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) be uniquely determined from \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) if the scaling parameter \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the scaling parameter \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse the frequency shift introduced by the exponential factor in \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thus making it challenging to uniquely recover the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) from \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).",
