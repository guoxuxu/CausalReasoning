  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its integration along a path in the complex plane. Analyze the influence of deforming the integration path from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = 1 + i \\\\) using two different paths, a straight line (path A) and a semicircle in the upper half-plane centered at \\\\( z = 0.5 + 0.5i \\\\) with radius 0.5 (path B).\n\nGiven the calculated integral value, can we determine which path (A or B) was chosen without knowledge of any intermediate values or adjustments?",
  "Explanation": "Without intermediate markers or knowledge of modifications to the path or the function, it is impossible to distinguish whether a straight line or a semicircle was used just from the integral's endpoint value alone, especially given the function's complex exponential behavior.",
