  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its effect on solutions to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and other similar transformations, impact the behavior of solutions over the complex plane.\n\nIf, at some complex point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a different complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( w(z) \\\\) for \\\\( z > z_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( c \\\\) or the initial modification?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\\\) introduces a new variable factor affecting the solution's trajectory. The final state \\\\( w(z) \\\\) will be dependent not only on \\\\( k \\\\) but also significantly on \\\\( c \\\\) and the original transformation due to the combined effects of the transformations across the complex plane.",
