  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices, and \\( u(t) \\) is a control function. We explore the impact of a transformation \\( f(x) = Sx \\), where \\( S \\) is a linear invertible matrix applied instantaneously at a certain time.\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is applied to a state \\( x_0 \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), and the system is then evolved under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\) for a control \\( u \\), will \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was just directly evolved under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( f(x) \\) alters the initial state \\( x \\) to \\( Sx_0 \\), which affects the system's initial condition. The trajectory will therefore diverge from that of the unmodified system unless \\( S \\) commutes perfectly with the dynamics governed by \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) does not contribute, resulting in different trajectories and thus different states at time \\( T \\).",
