  "Problem": "We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), on its related differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is derived by applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the temporal evolution is analyzed under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\) without intervention, does \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T represent the initial transformation accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) captures the frequency components, and the evolution by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\) translates into a modification in these components as \\\\( X(\\\\omega, t) = X(\\\\omega)e^{-at} \\\\). The Fourier transform at any time t = T correctly incorporates this exponential decay factor.",
