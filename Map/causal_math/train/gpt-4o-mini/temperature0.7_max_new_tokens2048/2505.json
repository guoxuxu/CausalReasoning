  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We study the influence of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) of the system.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) is subjected to a Fourier transform to become \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the PDE without additional transformations, will the state of the system \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be solely determined by the modified initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition via Fourier transform alters the mode amplitudes and may shift the phase of components, directly setting a new base state for the solution of the PDE. The system's evolution will follow from this modified state, meaning its state at any time T is determined by this transformed initial condition.",
