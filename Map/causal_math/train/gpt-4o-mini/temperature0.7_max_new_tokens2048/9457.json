  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. We explore the effects of the linear operator transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\tau e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over different time spans \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is computed for a given \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\) without any additional intervention, does the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) solely determine how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using an exponential weight over a time interval, which alters the original state and aggregates it into a single output. However, it doesn't solely determine the evolution trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) outside the operation, which is still governed by its differential equation.",
