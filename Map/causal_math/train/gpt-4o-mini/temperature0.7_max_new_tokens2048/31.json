  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is a matrix applied to a vector field in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex variable and B is another constant matrix, mapping real numbers to complex numbers.\n\nSuppose an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in the form of a new function \\\\( h(x) = e^{iCz}x \\\\) where C is a constant matrix. Will the resultant state at \\\\( z = T \\\\) depend exclusively on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( e^{iCz} \\\\) superimposes an additional transformation on the vector state, thus the outcome at \\\\( z = T \\\\) is influenced by A, B, and the intervention matrix C. Each of these transformations contributes to altering the trajectory and thereby the final state at time T.",
