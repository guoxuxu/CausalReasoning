  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. An integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to study its properties over time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven the final observation \\( z(T) \\), can we determine specifically whether the transformation \\( T(z) \\) or the intervention \\( P(z) \\) was applied, based solely on \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "From \\( z(T) \\) alone, it is not possible to disentangle the effects or even the presence of \\( T(z) \\) versus \\( P(z) \\). The trajectories leading to \\( z(T) \\) could be achieved by a variety of combinations of \\( c \\) and \\( T(z) \\), without a unique traceable path.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation T(z) and the intervention P(z) both influence the final observation z(T) derived from the function z(t). Additionally, the rate of change of z, denoted as dot{z}, is determined by the equation dot{z} = iωz, which connects the angular frequency ω to the function z(t). The properties of z(t) are influenced by the transformation T(z), which in turn affects the final observation z(T).",
