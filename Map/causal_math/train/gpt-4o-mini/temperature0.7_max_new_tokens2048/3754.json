  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), ignoring the amplitude \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = x\\frac{1}{s-i\\omega} \\\\), we can uniquely solve for \\\\( \\omega \\\\) as it determines the pole location on the imaginary axis in the complex plane, independent of the amplitude \\\\( x \\\\).",
