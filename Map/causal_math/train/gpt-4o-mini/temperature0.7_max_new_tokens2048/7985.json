  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\) and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the Fourier transformation defined by \\( F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\), where \\( \\omega \\) represents angular frequency.\n\nIf a specific \\( z(t) \\) function, say \\( z(t) = e^t \\), is transformed using the Fourier transform, will \\( F(z(t)) \\) at \\( \\omega = 1 \\) be same for any \\( t \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( e^t \\) for \\( \\omega = 1 \\) is a standard result that does not depend on the specific instance of time \\( t \\). It treats the function globally over the entire time domain rather than at specific instances, resulting in a consistent transform output for any \\( t \\).",
