  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. Consider the Laplace transform definition \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and evolves under its definition without additional transformation, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = b \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) be unique for a specific \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) distinctly depends on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\), yielding \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). This transform is uniquely determined by \\\\( a \\\\) for each \\\\( s \\\\) in the domain where the transform exists (\\\\( s > a \\\\)). The result does not change over time as it is a direct transformation, giving a unique \\\\( F(s) \\\\) corresponding to a given \\\\( a \\\\).",
