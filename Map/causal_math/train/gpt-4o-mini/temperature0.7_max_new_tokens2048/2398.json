  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Analyze the impact of applying a boundary condition transformation through \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original untransformed boundary conditions after observing \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), any observed solution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) could correspond to multiple potential boundary conditions due to the additive constant k, obscuring the original state.",
