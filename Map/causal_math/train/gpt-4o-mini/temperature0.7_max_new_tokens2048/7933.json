  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in complex function theory, defined by the equation \\\\(Ax = \\\\lambda x\\\\), where A is a linear operator on a complex vector space, and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are the eigenvalues. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt\\\\) on the eigenvalues.\n\nIf the linear operator A is modified to \\\\(A + B\\\\) with small matrix B, and we apply the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\), will the dominant eigenvalue of the transformed system at time t reflect the perturbation introduced by B?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration in A by the addition of B subtly shifts the location of its eigenvalues. Consequently, the integral transformation incorporating \\\\(e^{(A+B)t}\\\\) will preserve this shift and impact the resulting dominant eigenvalue, showcasing the sensitivity of the transformation to changes in the operator.",
