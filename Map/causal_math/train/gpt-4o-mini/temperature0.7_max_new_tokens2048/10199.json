  "Problem": "Consider a linear electrical circuit analysis where the voltage, \\\\( V(t) \\\\), across a resistor and inductor in series is described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), with R as resistance, L as inductance, and I as the current. Let's analyze the scenario where an operation is performed to transform the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) by a function \\\\( h(I) = I^2 \\\\) just before starting the system.\n\nIf an intervention using a function \\\\( j(I) = 3I \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final current \\\\( I(T) \\\\), for T > t_1 depend solely on R and L without being affected by the squaring of the initial current?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(I) \\\\) multiplies the current by three but does not reset or negate the influences of the initial current squaring. Therefore, the final current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) is impacted by both the squaring and tripling operations, meaning it depends not only on R and L but also the earlier changes to the system.",
