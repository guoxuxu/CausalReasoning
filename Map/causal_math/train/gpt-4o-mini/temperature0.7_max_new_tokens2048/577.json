  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined over the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}s \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The transformation by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for the interval [0,T], will the resulting function at time T, \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), be a scaled version of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{AT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( T \\\\) effectively integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) multiplied by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\). Given the nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), the result of the integration, after evaluating from 0 to T, includes a factor from the exponential term \\\\( e^{AT} \\\\\\), thereby scaling \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
