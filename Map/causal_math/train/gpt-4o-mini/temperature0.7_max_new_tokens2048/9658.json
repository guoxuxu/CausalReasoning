  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\), where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a complex function. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\lambda s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the precise original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) occurred, determining \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is complicated as the transformation could alter the path of evolution, rendering it infeasible to reverse-engineer the original state or trajectory uniquely, especially considering the dependence on the complex exponential.",
