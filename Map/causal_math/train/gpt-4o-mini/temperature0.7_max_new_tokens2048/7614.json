  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a channel described by the complex potential function \\\\( w(z) = Uz + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\ln(z) \\\\), which represents a combination of uniform flow and a source at the origin. Here, \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex position variable.\n\nGiven a measurement of the fluid's velocity field at various points, can we uniquely determine the values of \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) without knowing their initial proportions?",
  "Explanation": "The fluid's velocity field is influenced by both \\\\( U \\\\) (affecting the magnitude of uniform flow) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) (affecting the strength of the source), resulting in multiple combinations of \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) that could produce similar velocity measurements. Without additional constraints or knowledge of proportions, these parameters cannot be uniquely determined.",
