  "Problem": "Consider a system which can be modeled by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), shifting through complex numbers in a unit circle over time. An external transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nGiven only the trajectory \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at some time \\\\(T\\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the transformation used was \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation effects are multiplicative and do not necessarily disclose the sequence (i.e., \\\\(cd\\\\) is indistinguishable from \\\\(dc\\\\)), it is impossible to ascertain solely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both were applied, or in what order.",
