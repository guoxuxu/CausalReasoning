  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. The function transforms using a Fourier Transform, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier Transform output that changed over time, can we determine if the change was due to a frequency shift from \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega\\\\) or another type of modification?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform only provides information about the frequency composition of a function. While a shift in the transform indicates a change in frequency, it does not uniquely identify the nature of the intervention, such as a simple shift or more complex frequency modulation.",
