  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Fourier Transform on a given function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant. The Fourier Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( G(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\\\pi ft} dt \\\\). Analyze the outcomes of various implementation scenarios and their reverse causality.\n\nIf we apply a modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) before the Fourier Transform, will the resulting \\\\( G(f) \\\\) still correspond to the original transformation without the modulation?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a modulation such as \\\\( m(t) \\\\) alters the time domain function to \\\\( g(t)e^{bt} \\\\), which significantly modifies its Fourier transform. The resulting Fourier Transform will reflect the combined effects of both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( m(t) \\\\), thus diverging from the original \\\\( G(f) \\\\) without intervention.",
