  "Problem": "Consider a series of random variables \\\\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\\\), each formed by the linear transformation \\\\( Y_i = AX_i \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on these variables and explore the causal inference across these transformations.\n\nAfter observing the frequency spectrum of \\\\( Y_i \\\\), can we deduce if the original variable \\\\( X_i \\\\) underwent a Fourier transform initially?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency spectrum of \\\\( Y_i \\\\) only demonstrates the outcome after both transformations (initial variable change and either pre or post Fourier transform), not the sequence of operations. Therefore, we cannot uniquely determine the order of transformations solely based on the spectrum of \\\\( Y_i \\\\).",
