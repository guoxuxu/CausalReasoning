  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u + ku\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We explore the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) solely from the Fourier transformed state \\\\(F(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\(F(u)\\\\) was applied at the onset or later?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether or when the Fourier transform was applied, the deduced initial conditions can vary because the Fourier transformation can either pre-exist or be part of the evolving equation, impacting the frequency components in ways that are not reversible purely based on the transformed state at T.",
