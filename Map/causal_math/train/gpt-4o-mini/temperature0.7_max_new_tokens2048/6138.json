  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical scenario where a signal x(t) undergoes a Fourier Transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt\\\\). Further, this transformed signal is modified via a filter function H(ω), and the composite effect \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is obtained by applying the Inverse Fourier Transform to \\\\(H(\\\\omega) \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nAfter observing y(t) at time T, can we uniquely determine x(t) at time 0 without knowledge of H(ω)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the filter function H(ω), y(t) can represent multiple possible x(t) due to the modification effects of unknown H(ω). This scenario lacks sufficient information to uniquely backtrack to x(t) from y(t).",
