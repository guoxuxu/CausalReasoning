  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a nonzero complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be affected by the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) scales \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by a constant \\\\( C \\\\), which alters the trajectory from what would have been obtained by evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly. The quadratic term \\\\( kz^2 \\\\) in the differential equation amplifies this effect, making the trajectory dependent on the initial scaling.",
