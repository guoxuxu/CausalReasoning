  "Problem": "In a control system, a linear time-invariant differential equation describes the system's dynamics: \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The effect of control input is modeled by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), where K is a control matrix applied at time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear information on whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, and what the matrix K was, we cannot uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) since different K values could alter the initial conditions in a myriad of ways, leading to the same observed endpoint due to different trajectories.",
