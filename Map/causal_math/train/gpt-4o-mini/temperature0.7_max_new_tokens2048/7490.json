  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a diagonalizable matrix. We introduce an operator transformation \\\\( F(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is another matrix, and analyze its effect on the system over a period of time t.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( F(x) \\\\), it is ambiguous whether the observed state comes from \\\\( e^{Mt}x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{Mt}(Ax_0) \\\\). The operator \\\\( A \\\\) could alter the state in a way that is non-reversible just by observing the outcome unless specific properties of A are known.",
