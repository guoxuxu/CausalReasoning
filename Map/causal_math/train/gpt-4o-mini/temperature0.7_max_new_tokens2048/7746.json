  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional linear dynamical system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), with M being a 2x2 constant matrix. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another 2x2 constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be uniquely determined without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced because the transformation by D could have altered it in such a way that multiple initial states could result in the same observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially when D does not commute with M.",
