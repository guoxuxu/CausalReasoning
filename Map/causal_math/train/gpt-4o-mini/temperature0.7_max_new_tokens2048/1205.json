  "Problem": "Assume a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform on this function over the variable t.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) is applied to the function at t = 0, and then analyzed at s = a (any constant complex number), does the resultant transform indicate the same frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\). This transform inherently carries the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the form of its pole, accurately reflecting the original function's frequency component without alteration.",
