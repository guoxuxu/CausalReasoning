  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit in which the voltage across a capacitor undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined by \\\\(F(v(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty v(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), where \\\\(v(t)\\\\) is a voltage function of time, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We're analyzing the impact of the operation defined by the transfer function \\\\(H(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + i\\\\omega\\\\tau}\\\\), with a constant \\\\(\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nIf the transfer function \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\) is applied to the Fourier transformed voltage \\\\(F(v(t))\\\\) initially, and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the resulting time-domain signal, found by an inverse Fourier transform, be the same as if \\\\(v(t)\\\\) had been directly processed without undergoing \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\) on \\\\(F(v(t))\\\\) alters the spectral components of the voltage, effectively filtering the original signal. When this modified spectral representation is transformed back using the inverse Fourier transform, the resulting time-domain waveform differs from the unfiltered \\\\(v(t)\\\\).",
