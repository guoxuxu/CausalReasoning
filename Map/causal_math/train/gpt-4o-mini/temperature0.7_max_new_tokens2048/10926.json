  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation through a Laplace Transform given by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). The impact of manipulating \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) (a complex number in the Laplace Transform) on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is studied.\n\nBy observing changes in the region of convergence of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we infer the specific change in value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the region of convergence indicates a modification in frequency, but the exact value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined without knowing the original value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or having additional constraints — multiple \\\\( \\omega \\\\) values might yield the same or similar shifts in convergence.",
