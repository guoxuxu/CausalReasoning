  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar. The system's evolution is assessed with and without the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real scalar.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it's unclear if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) has been altered by the phase shift \\\\( e^{iBT} \\\\). The transformation can significantly change the initial state, and without this knowledge, one cannot uniquely trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) especially if \\\\( B \\\\) significantly alters the trajectory.",
