  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z'(t) = e^{i (\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega) t}\\\\) at a time t1 < T, will the outcome of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) at T remain unaffected by this frequency change?",
  "Explanation": "The change in frequency alters the function from t1 to T, affecting the integral computed by \\\\(T(z)\\\\). The result of the transformation at time T will differ due to the change in the oscillatory behavior of \\\\(z'(t)\\\\) compared to the original \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
