  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a circular path in the complex plane at a fixed radius of 1, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We examine the change in trajectory when this function is altered with a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t.\n\nGiven the complex value at time T, can we infer whether the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was squared at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the previous squaring operation from the complex value at T alone is ambiguous without additional information. The position could correspond to an unsquared function at a different frequency or a squared function, depending on the value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and T.",
