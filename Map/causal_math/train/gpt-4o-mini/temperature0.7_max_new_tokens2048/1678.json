  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z a complex variable. We examine the effect of an integral tranformation \\\\( h(g) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt} g(z) dt \\\\), with B as another constant matrix, over an interval [0, T].\n\nCan we retrieve the exact form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) by only observing \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) after it is computed without knowing B?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( h(g) \\\\) integrates \\\\( g(z) \\\\) with a function of B, making it inherently mixed with properties dependent on B. Without knowing B and how it interacts with A, we cannot unambiguously reconstruct \\\\( g(z) \\\\) from \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) alone.",
