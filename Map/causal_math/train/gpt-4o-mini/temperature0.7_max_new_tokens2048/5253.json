  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the behavior of the transformed function under a translation operation in the time domain, i.e., \\\\( g(t) = f(t-a) \\\\) with a positive a, represented by \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is shifted by \\\\( a \\\\) units in time to become \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and then transformed to Laplace space without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( e^{-as}F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation of a time-shifted function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\) units directly results in \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\). This is a standard property of the Laplace transform, demonstrating how a temporal translation affects the transform domain by a multiplicative exponential factor depending on the shift.",
