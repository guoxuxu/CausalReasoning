  "Problem": "Consider the linear system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We investigate the behavior of the system under the influence of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) denotes the Fourier transform and \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0)\\\\) is obtained via the Fourier transform of an initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) and evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} + L(k)\\\\hat{u} = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\) and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and transformation properties, evolving \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) and then transforming results in the same \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) as transforming first and then evolving in Fourier space since transformations and linear differential operations commute under these conditions.",
