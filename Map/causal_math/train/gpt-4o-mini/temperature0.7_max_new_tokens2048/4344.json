  "Problem": "Consider a function represented in the complex plane as \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\), which is transformed by the integral \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{z} dz\\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane that encircles the origin once and t is a parameter.\n\nGiven the final form of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), is it possible to deduce whether the correction factor \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied before the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the final result of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is dependent on the interplay between the correction factor and the parameter t during the transformation, multiple combinations of these factors could yield equivalent forms of \\\\(g(z)\\\\). Without specific knowledge of t or the untransformed function, identifying the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is not feasible.",
