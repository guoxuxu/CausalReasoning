  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\\\overline{z}} \\\\), where A and B are complex constants and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of z. We investigate the impact of a subsequent transformation \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), where C is a non-zero complex constant, applied over the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the specific values of A and B in \\\\( u(z) \\\\) solely by observing the function form of \\\\( v(z) \\\\) on the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Given only \\\\( v(z) \\\\), which is a scaled version of \\\\( u(z) \\\\), it isn't possible to uniquely determine the individual constants A and B without additional information. The scaling by C affects the absolute values but does not provide separate insights into the values of A and B.",
