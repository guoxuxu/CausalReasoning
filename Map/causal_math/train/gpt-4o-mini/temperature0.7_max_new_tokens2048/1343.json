  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation governed by Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx \\\\). We study the effect of applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), which is the multiplication of f(x) by x, and its impact over the transformed function.\n\nIf a differential operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) is applied as an intervention after \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), does the resulting Fourier Transform solely depend on \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) or does the effect of multiplication by x still influence the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The additional differential operation will produce a complex modification of the Fourier Transform. While \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) would guide the final outcome, the initial multiplication by x and subsequent differentiation would significantly alter the resulting Fourier spectrum, maintaining the influence of both operations.",
