  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\theta(t)}\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant radial distance and \\\\(\\\\theta(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent angle. We explore the transformation under the matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) & \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) representing a rotation by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\).\n\nGiven the final position at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we precisely determine what rotations were applied (whether \\\\( M(t) \\\\), \\\\( N(t) \\\\), or both), only from the value of the position?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) can lead to the same final position due to the overlapping nature of rotations. Thus, without additional data on the rotation speeds or sequence, we can't uniquely identify the exact interventions used.",
