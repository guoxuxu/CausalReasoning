  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = G(s) \\\\). We analyze scenarios where g(t) is a solution to a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with initial conditions, and \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, we study the implications of adding transformations like \\\\( g(t) = h(t)g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is known.\n\nIf the initial condition of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is modified by a scalar factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) at t = 0, and the function is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) without further intervention, does the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) also change by the same scalar factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\alpha g(t) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\alpha G(s) \\\\), multiplying the initial condition by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) proportionally changes the Laplace transform. The linearity of both the differential equation and the Laplace transformation ensures the transform of the resulting function is simply scaled by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
