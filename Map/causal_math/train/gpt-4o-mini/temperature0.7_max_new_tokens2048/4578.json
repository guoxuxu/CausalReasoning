  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{αt}z \\\\) where \\\\( α \\\\) is a complex constant, applied at different points in the time evolution.\n\nIs it possible to determine the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the transformation could have altered both the magnitude and phase of the initial state, dependent on the real and imaginary components of \\\\( α \\\\).",
