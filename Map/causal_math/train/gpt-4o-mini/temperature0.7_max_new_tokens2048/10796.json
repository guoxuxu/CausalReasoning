  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) representing oscillatory behavior with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). We examine the scenario where we apply a Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thereby transforming the function into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven a transformed signal in the frequency domain after unknown alterations, is it possible to determine the precise manipulations applied in the frequency domain only by observing the time-domain outcome post-inverse Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different frequency-domain manipulations (such as different types of filtering, amplitude adjustments, or phase shifts) could lead to similar alterations in the time-domain signal. Without additional information, it is impossible to precisely back-infer the exact nature of these interventions.",
