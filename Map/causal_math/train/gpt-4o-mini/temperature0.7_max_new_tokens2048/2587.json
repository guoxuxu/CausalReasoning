  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the function transforms under the operation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(s) ds \\\\), which is integrated over the time interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf an intervention modifies z(t) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within \\\\( 0 < t_1 < T \\\\) by applying a transformation such that \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\neq \\\\omega \\\\) for \\\\( t_1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq T \\\\), will the calculation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from 0 to T yield a result that depends only on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the functional form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during the interval \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), introducing a new frequency \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Hence, the resulting integral \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), reflecting the influence of this new functional behavior.",
