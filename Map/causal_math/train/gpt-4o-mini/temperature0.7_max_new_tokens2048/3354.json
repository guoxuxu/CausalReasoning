  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where a and b are complex constants. We analyze how the mapping under this function and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\), where c and d are also complex constants, affect outcomes.\n\nCan the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be accurately deduced at t = 0 after observing an outcome at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is uncertain if the observed state results solely from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or from a subsequent transformation. The lack of knowledge about \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces ambiguities in deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) precisely.",
