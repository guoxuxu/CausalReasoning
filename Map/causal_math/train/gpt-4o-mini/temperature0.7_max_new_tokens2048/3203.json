  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider the modification of the initial temperature distribution by the function \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( h(u) = u \\\\times \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) is applied, will the final temperature distribution at a later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be affected only by the initial conditions set by \\\\( g(u) \\\\) on \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and not by \\\\( h(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) modifies the temperature distribution again by introducing a multiplicative cosine term, further complicating the temporal evolution of the temperature field under the heat equation. Both the initial sine addition and subsequent cosine multiplication affect the final state at time T.",
