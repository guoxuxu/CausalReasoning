  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the final output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T depend exclusively on the original trajectory and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) modifies the state of \\\\( z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and consequently alters the trajectory subsequently used in the integral transformation. Since \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the functional part from 0 to T, this intervention fundamentally affects the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T.",
