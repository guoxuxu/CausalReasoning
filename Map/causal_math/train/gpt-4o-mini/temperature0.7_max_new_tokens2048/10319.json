  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\), where A is a constant matrix and x is a constant complex vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transformation given by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention is made where the vector \\( x \\) is modified to \\( x + \\delta \\) where \\( \\delta \\) is a small constant vector, will \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( \\delta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\delta \\) as an intervention directly alters the trajectory starting at \\( t_1 \\), resulting in a different \\( z(t) \\) post-intervention and consequently a modified \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}(x + \\delta) \\). This change indicates dependency on both \\( A \\) and \\( \\delta \\).",
