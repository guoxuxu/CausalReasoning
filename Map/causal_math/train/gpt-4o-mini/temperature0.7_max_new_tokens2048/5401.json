  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the heat diffusion over a plane is studied. The temperature distribution is represented by the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), which satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. The experiment manipulates this distribution via a sudden localized heating at point \\\\( x_0 \\\\), represented by the function \\\\( \\\\delta(x - x_0) \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( \\\\delta(x - x_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) modify the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for times \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\) in comparison to a scenario where no localized heating occurs?",
  "Explanation": "The localized heating at \\\\( x_0 \\\\) introduces a Dirac delta function into the initial condition, which modifies the heat distribution uniquely for points in time after \\\\( t_0 \\\\). The evolving heat equation then spreads this point source of heat over the plane, altering the temperature distribution compared to an undisturbed scenario.",
