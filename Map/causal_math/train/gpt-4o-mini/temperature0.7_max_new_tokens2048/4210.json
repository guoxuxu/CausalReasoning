  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) for complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. By defining a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix, we test the effect over a period of time t.\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be accurately retraced from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the initial conditions impacted by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) are indeterminate. If D and C do not commute, or if D influences the dynamics in any significant way, the trajectory cannot be solely reconstructed from C and the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
