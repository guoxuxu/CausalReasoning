  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i \\\\theta}z\\\\) acts on a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) in the complex plane. Here, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a real number representing a rotation angle. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\) for dynamics given by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant, is considered.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a variable \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) to \\\\(t = T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) initially rotates \\\\(z_0\\\\) by \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\). Subsequent evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) only affects the angle by rotating further with angular velocity \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). Therefore, the final position of \\\\(z\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) will reflect an additional rotation of \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\), altering its position compared to direct evolution.",
