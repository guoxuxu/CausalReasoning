  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\(z = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator, representing the transformation matrix. We explore the effects of applying a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number.\n\nFrom the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we precisely identify the interventions applied (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), purely from the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\(z(T)\\\\) can result from different combinations of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) values, affecting the system output via their respective complex exponentials. The overlap in potential effects from different parameters makes it impossible to definitively determine the interventions from the final state alone.",
