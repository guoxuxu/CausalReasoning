  "Problem": "A two-dimensional linear system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) represents a rotation. We examine the effect of the function \\\\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t, where \\\\( B = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), which also results in a rotational transformation.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we determine the exact initial state \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was applied, considering no additional knowledge about B?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirming the application of the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\), it’s impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( y_0 \\\\) because the added rotation by B could align the system into a state indistinguishable at T from one that evolved under \\\\( A \\\\) alone. The lack of information on B’s characteristics (like rotational speed or phase changes) prevents reversing the state unequivocally.",
