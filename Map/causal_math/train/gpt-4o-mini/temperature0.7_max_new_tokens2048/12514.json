  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving a system of linear equations encoded by matrix operations. Let \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) represent the system with matrix A and vector b. Consider the impact of pre-multiplying both sides by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) (where M is an invertible matrix).\n\nIf during the solving of \\\\( M(Ax) = Mb \\\\), an additional operation \\\\( N(Ax) = Nb \\\\) (where N is another invertible matrix) is applied at a certain time, will the solution to \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) remain ultimately unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the application of M, the additional application of N as a transformation also does not change the eventual solution of \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). The matrix operations are reversible, and thus applying N, just like M, can be inverted to retrieve the original system without altering the solution.",
