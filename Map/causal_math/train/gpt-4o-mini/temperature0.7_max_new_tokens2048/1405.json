  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on a region in the complex plane under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^t dt \\\\). Analyze the impact of this function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed for \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) along a straight path from 0 to \\\\\\\\((( z \\\\\\\\)), will the integral value at \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) be solely dependent on the end-point \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) and not on the path taken?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\\\\\(( e^t \\\\\\\\)) is holomorphic over the entire complex plane, and by Cauchy's integral theorem, the integral of \\\\\\\\(( e^t \\\\\\\\)) between two points along any path that does not enclose any singularities (of which there are none) will only depend on the endpoints. Therefore, any straight or curved path from 0 to \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) will yield the same result in the absence of interventions.",
