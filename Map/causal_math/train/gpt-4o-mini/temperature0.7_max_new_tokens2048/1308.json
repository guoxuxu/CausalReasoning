  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the changes in the output when a transformation defined by \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( y(t) \\) after various transformations (integral and derivative) applied at different times, can we determine the exact sequence or types of transformations and the time they were applied, based solely on the knowledge of \\( y(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations, their sequence, and their timing add layers of complexity that alter \\( y(t) \\)'s evolution each time. The overlap and interaction of transformations (integral and derivative) based on where and when they are applied to \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) create a cumulative and potentially non-reversible effect, making it difficult to precisely decipher the individual and sequential effects just from \\( y(t) \\) at a specific \\( t \\).",
