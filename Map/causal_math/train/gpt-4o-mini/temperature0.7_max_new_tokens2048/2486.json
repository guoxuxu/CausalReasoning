  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\) on an interval \\\\([0, L]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(u(0,t) = 0\\\\) and \\\\(u(L, t) = 0\\\\). An external source \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is introduced, altering the initial condition to \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) of the system at some time T > 0, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(f(x)\\\\) that led to this state, assuming no further data about the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation involves diffusion which inherently blurs initial conditions over time. Due to this smoothing effect, multiple initial conditions could theoretically evolve into similar or indistinguishable states at later times, thus the original \\\\(f(x)\\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) alone.",
