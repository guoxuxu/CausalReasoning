  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) and its effect through an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter. We examine the behaviors of different functions and the impact of alterations to the integral transform.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is modified to \\\\(g(z) = \\\\frac{2}{z}\\\\) at t = 0 and the new function is then transformed by \\\\(T\\\\) without further modifications, will \\\\(T[g](s)\\\\) at s = a (a complex number) yield the same result as the unmodified \\\\(T[f](s)\\\\) at s = a?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the function from \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) to \\\\(g(z) = \\\\frac{2}{z}\\\\) effectively scales the integral transformation's result by a factor of 2 across all values of s. Therefore, the output \\\\(T[g](s) = 2T[f](s)\\\\) at any s, including \\\\(s = a\\\\), will not be the same but rather scaled.",
