  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the impact of the Laplace Transform and its inverse on this function over time.\n\nIf a scaling function \\\\( f(t) = 2z(t) \\\\) is introduced at some time after computing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), and the Laplace Transform is then recalculated, will the new transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without the intervention affecting the result?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with scaling affects the Laplace Transform significantly. The new transform, \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\), will represent the scaling, resulting in \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), which clearly shows the effect of the scaling intervention.",
