  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of this function is studied under a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different intervals of time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve with \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at the beginning modifies the trajectory early on; specifically, \\\\( z^2(0) = 1 \\\\), which then evolves according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > 0 \\\\). Since the square of the exponential results in a quadruple increase in frequency, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) changes from \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{2i\\\\omega T} \\\\), leading to different outcomes.",
