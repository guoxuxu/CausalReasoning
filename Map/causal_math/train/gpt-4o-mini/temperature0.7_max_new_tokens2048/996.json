  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. We examine the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) to the system, where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nConsidering the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), by only examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the interactions of the exponential transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) with the natural system dynamics, multiple combinations of A, B and initial conditions could yield the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, it's impossible to uniquely identify which transformations were applied based solely on the endpoint.",
