  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real constant matrix and z a complex number. We study the behavior of this function when subject to transformations and analyze the inverse Laplace transformation which is given by \\\\( F(p) = L^{-1} \\\\{ f(z) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves naturally with the inverse Laplace transform applied, is the resulting function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) at p solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform \\\\( F(p) \\\\) directly depends on the form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) which is defined explicitly by \\\\( A \\\\) and the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). There are no other variables introduced, thus the resulting function is solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
