  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant and determine how this affects the evolution of the function over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T(z) = cz \\\\), the factor of scaling (c) introduces an ambiguity in determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Multiple initial conditions can scale and evolve to produce the same end state given different values of c.",
