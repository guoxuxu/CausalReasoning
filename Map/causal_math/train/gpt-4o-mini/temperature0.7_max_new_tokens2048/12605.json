  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\), where C is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where D is a linear operator and S is an invertible matrix, over time t.\n\nCan we pinpoint the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after examining \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T if we don't know whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and lacking knowledge of S, D, and their relationship to C, it's challenging to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformations introduced by \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Dt}S \\\\) could significantly alter the initial conditions, masking the original state.",
