  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing a physical system. We utilize a Fourier Transform to analyze frequency components, defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without interventions?",
  "Explanation": "If the function evolves naturally according to known physical laws and there's no intervention, the Fourier Transform provides sufficient information to uniquely reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) due to the properties of the Fourier Transform being a bijective operation in this context.",
