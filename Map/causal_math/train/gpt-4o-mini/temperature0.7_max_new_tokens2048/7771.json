  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\(u(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u\\\\) and investigate its implications over variable \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf during the analysis, another transformation \\\\(w(z) = e^{Cz}u(z)\\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at a certain point, will the final Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(z))\\\\) be independent of the transformations applied by A and C?",
  "Explanation": "Both matrices A and C through the exponential functions \\\\(e^{Az}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{Cz}\\\\) will influence the end behavior of \\\\(u(z)\\\\) significantly. The Fourier transform will reflect these effects distinctly, leading to a spectrum that is shaped by both transformations and not just one or none.",
