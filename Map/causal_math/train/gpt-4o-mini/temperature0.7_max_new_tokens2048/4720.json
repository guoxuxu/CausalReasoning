  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation representing the rate of change in the electrical potential V across a capacitor in an RC circuit, given by \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V \\\\). A step function intervention via a voltage source modifies the potential by adding a function \\\\( h(t) = He^{Dt} \\\\), where H, D are constants and t is time.\n\nGiven the known final voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely deduce whether interventions \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or both, were applied, based only on the end condition?",
  "Explanation": "The final voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) could result from varying combinations of initial conditions and interventions \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or other unknown factors. The overlapping effects of different transformations, along with their parameters, make it difficult to accurately distinguish the interventions used just from the final state.",
