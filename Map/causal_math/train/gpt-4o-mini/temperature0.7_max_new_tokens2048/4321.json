  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being different constant matrices. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is applied from t=0 to t=T, does \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on A and B without further transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) involves the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Cs} \\\\), thereby adding an additional dynamic driven by C. This transformation affects the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and integrates a dependence on C in addition to A and B.",
