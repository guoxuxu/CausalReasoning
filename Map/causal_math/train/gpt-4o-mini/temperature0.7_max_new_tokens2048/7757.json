  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transformation applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) described as \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) dt \\\\). We analyze the impact of the modification where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by a squared modulus of another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), initiating as \\\\( g(t) = |h(t)|^2 f(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed using Fourier transformation without further modifications, will \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) alone was transformed directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) will be affected by the initial multiplication by \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\), which modifies the frequency content of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The resultant Fourier transform is a convolution of \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) \\\\) with the Fourier transform of \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\), indicating a different outcome.",
