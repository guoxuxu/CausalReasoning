  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original signal \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing the output of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, without knowing the specific form of s?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\), the variation introduced by the exponential term in the integral transformation obscures the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The integration process, influenced by \\\\( s \\\\), entangles the effect in a way that makes isolation of the original cause without additional information impossible.",
