  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). We examine how the system evolves with and without the application of \\\\( T \\\\) over time.\n\nKnowing the function state at time T, and assuming no transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, can we unequivocally reconstruct the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "In this case, the path is uniquely determined by the natural evolution of the function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), and with knowledge that no transformation was applied, reconstructing the path from initial state to T is straightforward as it follows the known exponential behavior.",
