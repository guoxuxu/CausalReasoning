  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex growth rate. We are examining the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda s} z(s) ds \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the function is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be influenced solely by the angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) introduces a dependency on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) as well, because it alters the integral path and accumulates effects dependent on both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This makes the behavior at time T dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the integrated effect of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",
