  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Analyze the changes induced by performing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function, leading to the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nCan the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform creates a peak (Dirac delta function) at the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), which can be uniquely identified in the spectrum \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\). This allows for precise determination of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the effect back to the cause.",
