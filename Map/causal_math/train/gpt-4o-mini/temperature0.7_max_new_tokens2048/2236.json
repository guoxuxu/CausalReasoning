  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we determine if the transformation was applied, and identify the specific parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), based solely on observing the Laplace transform result \\\\(T[g](s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the function after intervention, \\\\(T[g](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - (a + i\\\\omega)}\\\\), allows for identification of the real part which corresponds to \\\\(a\\\\) and the imaginary part which is \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). These parameters can be uniquely determined from the function's pole in the complex plane.",
