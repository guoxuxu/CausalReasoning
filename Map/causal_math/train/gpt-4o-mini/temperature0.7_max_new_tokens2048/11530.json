  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, and its impact when integrated along a path in the complex plane. The study explores how the path of integration, and potential path modifications (interventions), affect the evaluation of the integral.\n\nGiven the integral result of the complex function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\), can we uniquely determine the path taken in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The integral result of an analytic function between two points in the complex plane is path-independent as long as the function remains analytic throughout the domain and there are no singularities between \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_T \\\\). Thus, multiple paths can yield the same result.",
