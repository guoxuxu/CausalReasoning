  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The function evaluates the transformation of complex functions in the complex plane and further examines how transformations such as Fourier Transform affects the signal.\n\nIf a modification \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before taking the Fourier Transform, will the resulting transform \\\\( G(w) \\\\) simply be the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z^2 \\\\) times \\\\( F(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation of squaring the function prior to the Fourier Transform profoundly alters the nature of the original function. It's not merely a multiplicative scaling in the frequency domain; rather, it affects the function's entire structure and hence the result of the Fourier Transform can't be represented as a simple product of transforms.",
