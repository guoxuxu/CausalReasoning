  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a particle's position in the complex plane. Assume the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An integral transform \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\) is considered to analyze the system at different instances.\n\nGiven the output at \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (either \\\\(f(z)\\\\) or \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or both) were applied during the evolution to time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlaid effects of the transformations \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) can result in similar or indistinguishable trajectories at time \\\\(T\\\\), making it impossible to definitively identify which transformations were applied based solely on the endpoint data.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The position of the particle in the complex plane at time T, z(T), is determined by its evolution over time, governed by the differential equation, which relates the time derivative of z, denoted as dot{z}, to the frequency omega and z itself. The integral transform f(z) analyzes the system by integrating z over time, contributing to the output. The function g(z) also processes z and contributes to the output, indicating that both transforms might be involved in the analysis of z(T).",
