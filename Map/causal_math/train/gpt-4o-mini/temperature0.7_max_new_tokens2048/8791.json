  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's output. Suppose an external operator transforms the function using a unit step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( g(t) = f(t) u(t-a) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), further modulation by another step function \\\\( h(t) = u(t-b) \\\\) (where \\\\( b > a \\\\)) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\), would the resulting transform \\\\( L[h(t)g(t)] \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and not be influenced by the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of step functions \\\\( u(t-a) \\\\) and \\\\( u(t-b) \\\\), where \\\\( b > a \\\\), results in a composition of shifts in the Laplace domain that affects the end result. Thus, \\\\( L[h(t)g(t)] \\\\) depends on both shifts introduced by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), not solely on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
