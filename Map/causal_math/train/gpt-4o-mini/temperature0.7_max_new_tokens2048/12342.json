  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. Let's examine the system's behavior under the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and perform perturbations using multiplication by another function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive real constant.\n\nIf after applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\) is multiplied at a time \\( t_1 \\), does this alter the final frequency spectrum to include frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\) post transformation affects the frequency spectrum. The multiplication corresponds to a convolution in the frequency domain with \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{h(t)\\} \\), broadening the original delta function and introducing components at frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\), centered around \\( \\omega \\) but with a decay rate governed by \\( \\alpha \\).",
