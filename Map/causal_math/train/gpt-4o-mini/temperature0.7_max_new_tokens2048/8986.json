  "Problem": "Analyzing the role of the Laplace Transform in solving differential equations, consider a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined as \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) of a function y(t) is applied to convert this ODE into the algebraic equation in s-domain.\n\nAfter solving the ODE using the Laplace Transform and obtaining y(t) at some t > 0, can we uniquely determine the initial conditions y(0) and y'(0) without knowing they were set at the outset?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform linearly encodes the initial conditions into the algebraic equation in the s-domain. Knowing y(t) at any t > 0 and applying the inverse Laplace Transform allows the unique recovery of the initial conditions, due to the linearity and bijectivity of the transformation under given proper conditions.",
