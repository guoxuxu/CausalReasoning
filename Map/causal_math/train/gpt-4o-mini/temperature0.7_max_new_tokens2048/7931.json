  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance Z represented by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + 2s + 5} \\\\). We analyze the circuit's response under the Laplace transformation of an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\).\n\nIf a filtering process represented by \\\\( F(s) = s + 2 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at a specific time, will the final output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) depend only on the original input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and the impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), disregarding the filter's influence?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the system substantially. The output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) will now be the product of \\\\( X(s) \\\\), \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(s) \\\\), thus making the resulting system response dependent on the characteristics of the filter as well as the initial conditions.",
