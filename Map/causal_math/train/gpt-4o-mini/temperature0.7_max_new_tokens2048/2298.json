  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier Transform scenario where a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) is transformed into its Fourier counterpart \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and affected by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(x) = e^{-a x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nAfter observing the final state by either method described above, can we accurately determine whether the convolution was performed in the frequency domain or the spatial domain?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the convolution theorem and the reversible properties of the Fourier transform, the end result of the convolution does not retain information about the domain in which the convolution was performed. Both methods are mathematically equivalent and lead to indistinguishable outcomes.",
