  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + k^2 u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( U(k) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( U(k) \\\\) is obtained by applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = 0 and then analyzing how \\\\( u(x) \\\\) evolves naturally by solving the PDE, will \\\\( U(k) \\\\) remain unchanged across the domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a solution to the PDE, which satisfies the given conditions, will remain invariant under the natural evolution of the PDE. As the PDE's characteristics don't change with respect to the transformation properties, \\\\( U(k) \\\\) remains stable.",
