  "Problem": "Consider a frequency analysis where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), leading to an output signal represented by the product \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) \\\\) post-processing through the LTI system, can we uniquely determine \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity, assuming no knowledge of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) \\\\) not only depends on the invertibility of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), but also on whether \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) contained any components entirely attenuated or altered by the LTI system. Without knowing the characteristics of the original signal and the full properties of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), it’s not possible to ensure an accurate reconstruction of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
