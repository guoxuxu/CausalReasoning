  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is then transformed using a Fourier Transform to analyze its frequency components over time.\n\nCan we precisely recover the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in a delta function at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), which precisely pinpoints the original frequency. Thus, the recovery of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the transform is exact, allowing an accurate deduction of the cause from the observed effect.",
