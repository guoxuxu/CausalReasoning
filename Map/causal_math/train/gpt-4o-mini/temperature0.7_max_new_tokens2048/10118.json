  "Problem": "Investigate a unitary transformation system defined by \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a complex vector. Consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Vz\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is another unitary matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\(V\\\\), it’s impossible to uniquely determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) just from \\\\(z(t)\\\\). The potential application of \\\\(V\\\\) could have modified \\\\(z_0\\\\), and because both \\\\(U\\\\) and \\\\(V\\\\) are unitary, they preserve the norm but change other properties, impeding the exact trace back to \\\\(z_0\\\\) without additional information.",
