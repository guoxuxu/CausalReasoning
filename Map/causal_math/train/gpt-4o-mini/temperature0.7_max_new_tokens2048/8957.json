  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf initially, at t = 0, the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given by \\( z(0) = z_0 \\), and evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will its Fourier transform at any time \\\\( t \\\\) reflect the same frequency spectrum as the initial \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) indicates that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is of the form \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). A Fourier transform of such a function results in a frequency spectrum that centers around \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), unchanged by the scalar factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Thus, the frequency spectrum remains focused on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), reflecting that of the initial condition unchanged.",
