  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. We explore the effects of a transformation using Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega) \\\\), especially its impact on the solution characteristics over time.\n\nCan we recover the exact original function \\\\(u_0\\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) after allowing the system to evolve to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse are mathematically designed to recover signal or function precisely, provided that we can recover the complete spectrum of frequencies without loss or noise. Hence, knowing \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) allows for the precise recovery of \\\\(u_0\\\\) via the inverse transform.",
