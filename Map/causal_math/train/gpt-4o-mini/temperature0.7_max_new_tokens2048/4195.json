  "Problem": "Consider the system described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). The system is analyzed for the impact of multiplying by a polynomial function \\\\( p(t) = t^k \\\\) and then taking the Laplace transform again. Here, \\\\( k \\\\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( q(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant) is multiplied to \\\\( h(t) = t^k g(t) \\\\) and the transform \\\\( Q(s) \\\\) is taken, will \\\\( Q(s) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( p(t) = t^k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) yields \\\\( Q(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{\\\\lambda t} t^k g(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{d^k}{ds^k}G(s - \\\\lambda) \\\\), demonstrating dependency not only on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) but also on the initial function \\\\( t^k \\\\). The final expression is influenced significantly by both \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function g(t) transforms to G(s) through the Laplace transform, and multiplying g(t) by the polynomial function p(t) results in h(t), which also transforms to G(s). The function q(t) is formed by multiplying h(t) by e^(λt), and this new function h(t) leads to the transform Q(s). Therefore, Q(s) depends on G(s) and h(t), indicating that Q(s) is influenced by both G(s) and the polynomial function p(t).",
