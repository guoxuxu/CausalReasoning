  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-zt} dz \\\\). Let \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real positive parameter.\n\nGiven \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a particular \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) that was used in the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for a specific \\\\( t \\\\) does not uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), because the transformation complicates direct retrieval of the function form due to the integration over a complex variable and the exponential decay, which could align with several potential functions.",
