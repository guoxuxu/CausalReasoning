  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates over time. We study the effect of a Laplace Transform \\\\( F(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(p) \\\\) which transforms the complex-valued function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf an external sinusoidal force \\\\( f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing both its amplitude and phase, will this intervention be clearly identifiable in the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\), distinct from intrinsic characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the sinusoidal force introduces new frequency components to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which are distinctly captured in \\\\( F(p) \\\\) by additional poles and zeros at the corresponding frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). These changes in \\\\( F(p) \\\\) help in identifying the impact of the intervention.",
