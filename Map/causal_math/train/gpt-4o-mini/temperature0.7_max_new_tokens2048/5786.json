  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor of capacitance C, a resistor of resistance R, and a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t}. Using complex impedance for the circuit analysis, examine the effects of an intervention by introducing an inductor with inductance L midway through an observation period.\n\nHaving observed the steady-state current I(t) at time t = T, can one confirm the frequency \\\\omega of the voltage source V(t) without knowing whether an inductor was later introduced?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the inductor's introduction and its effect on the total impedance, one cannot reliably backtrack to determine the exact frequency of the voltage source from the steady-state current alone, as the inductor alters the overall system dynamics.",
