  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds\\\\). We investigate how the results of further transformations and initial conditions evolve through the system.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 be deduced from the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) at a later time T if no information is provided about the intervention with \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity of the transformation, which integrates over an exponentially modified trajectory, retrieving the precise initial function \\\\(z_0\\\\) from the outcome of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) without a priori knowledge of the application of \\\\(T\\\\) is not feasible. The transformation obscures the original characteristics of \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
