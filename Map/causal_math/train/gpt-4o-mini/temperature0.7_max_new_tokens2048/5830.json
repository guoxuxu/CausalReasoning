  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), and assume a perturbation in the form of multiplication by a complex exponential, \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is an original signal and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency.\n\nCan we determine whether the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) \\\\) was calculated from a signal \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or from \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) by observing the output transform at s = \\\\sigma only?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the presence of the exponential factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), determining the function's origin from its transform at a single point s = \\\\sigma is ambiguous, as the same transform could result from different inputs due to shifts in the s-domain.",
