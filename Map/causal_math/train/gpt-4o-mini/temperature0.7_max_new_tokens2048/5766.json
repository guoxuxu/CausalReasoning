  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation under the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F \\\\). The Fourier Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) as \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\Omega) \\\\), can we confirm that the original function was \\\\( e^{i\\\\Omega t} \\\\) without knowing any details about the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific nature of the Fourier Transform creating a Dirac delta function at \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) without dispersion or additional components directly indicates that the original time function was a pure exponential \\\\( e^{i\\\\Omega t} \\\\). This is characteristic of sinusoidal functions in the frequency domain.",
