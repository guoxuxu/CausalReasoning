  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We study the influence of the transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on all parameters: \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). The transformations \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) introduce compound effects of scaling and rotation, influencing the end state significantly.",
