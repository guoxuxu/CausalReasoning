  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a channel described by the complex potential function \\\\( w(z) = Uz + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\ln(z) \\\\), which represents a combination of uniform flow and a source at the origin. Here, \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex position variable.\n\nBy observing the flow pattern changes near the origin, can we infer the exact location and strength of the sink introduced at \\\\( z = a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the sink on the flow near the origin is nontrivial and depends on the relative position \\\\( a \\\\) and the strength \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\). Multiple configurations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) might result in similar alterations in the flow near the origin, making it impossible to unambiguously determine the sink's parameters just from local observations without further information on the flow dynamics.",
