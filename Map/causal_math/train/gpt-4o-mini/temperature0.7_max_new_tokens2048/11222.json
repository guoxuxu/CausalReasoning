  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function describes the evolution of a complex number over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T{[z]} = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to study the cumulative effect over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nCan we infer the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by analyzing the outcome of \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral transformation result, multiple frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could produce similar effects due to the periodic nature of the exponential function, especially over a specific interval. Without further data, exact inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is not feasible.",
