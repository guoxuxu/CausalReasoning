  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time. The function is transformed by a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We analyze causal inference when altering the frequency spectrum by filtering specific frequency components.\n\nIf a high-pass filter is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention to the frequency-modified signal \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then processed to obtain a time-domain signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\), will the final signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) be independent of the initial low-pass filter applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) will retain the impact of both the low-pass and high-pass filters. The sequential application of these filters influences the frequency components present in \\\\( z''(t) \\\\). Since they focus on different frequency ranges, the aggregation of their effects influences the overall characteristics of the resulting signal.",
