  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the system's transfer function in the Laplace domain. Suppose there's a sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\), and we are investigating the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) after processing through the system.\n\nCan we deduce the amplitude \\\\(A\\\\) of the original sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\) from the steady-state output \\\\(y(t)\\\\), without any prior knowledge about \\\\(H(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the system's transfer function \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the scaling and phase alteration imparted by the system cannot be quantified, thus making it impossible to accurately determine the original amplitude \\\\(A\\\\) of the input signal.",
