  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nGiven the final result after applying both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformation was applied first just by the output at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint results from a combination and integration of transformations, and these transformations' effects overlap in the time domain. Without distinct markers or non-overlapping effects from each, it's impossible to untangle which transformation was applied first. The integrals mingle the influences of each transformation, obscuring their order and individual impact.",
