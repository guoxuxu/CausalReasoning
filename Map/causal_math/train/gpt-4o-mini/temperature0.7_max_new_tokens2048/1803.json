  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as a complex exponential \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which undergoes transformations under various operations mapped in a complex function space. The transformations are represented by the operators \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Lz(t) = e^{kt}z(t) \\\\) for some real constant k, and \\\\( M \\\\) as \\\\( Mz(t) = e^{ht}z(t) \\\\) with h being another real constant.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the operator \\\\( M \\\\) is introduced as an intervention on the system that was initially influenced by \\\\( L \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the effects of L and not M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\( M \\\\) further transforms the system to \\\\( e^{(i+k+h)t} \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T is influenced by both k and h, the factors in operators L and M, making the outcome dependent on both transformations.",
