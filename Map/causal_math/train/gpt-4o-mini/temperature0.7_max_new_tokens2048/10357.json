  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\). A transformation is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the coupled equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z \\\\) initially modifies the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), leading to a trajectory that evolves differently due to the initial phase shift. The system's response will depend on the interaction between the phase shift introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the coefficients A and B in the differential equations.",
