  "Problem": "Consider a system in a complex plane characterized by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which must hold for a function \\\\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\\\) to be analytic in a region. Let \\\\( T \\\\) represent a transformation where \\\\( T(z) = z^2 \\\\) and explore this transformation's effect on the analytic properties of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to a complex variable \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f \\\\) is computed, is the resulting function \\\\( f(T(z_0)) \\\\) guaranteed to be analytic if \\\\( f \\\\) was analytic?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( z^2 \\\\) is also an analytic function everywhere in the complex plane and the composition of two analytic functions is analytic, \\\\( f(T(z)) \\\\) remains analytic if \\\\( f \\\\) originally was.",
