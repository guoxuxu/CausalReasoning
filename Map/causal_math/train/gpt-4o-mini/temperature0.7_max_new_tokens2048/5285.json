  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis context where the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) a complex constant, is analyzed in terms of its effect on the unit circle in the complex plane. We are particularly interested in how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), for a real number \\\\( t \\\\), affects the evolution of points under \\\\( f(z) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) on the unit circle at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then it evolves without further modification under the definition of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the image of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) remain on the unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\) generally does not preserve the unit circle, particularly because the addition of the \\\\( cz \\\\) term (depending on the value of \\\\( c \\\\)) can map points inside or outside the unit circle.",
