  "Problem": "Consider a linear function \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, used to transform complex vector input \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is determined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer whether the initial vector was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\), assuming we know the transformation matrix \\\\( C \\\\) but not the initial state?",
  "Explanation": "Without a priori knowledge of whether \\\\( C \\\\) was applied initially, it's challenging to distinguish if \\\\( z(T) \\\\) came from \\\\( e^{DT}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{DT}(Cz_0) \\\\). The determinant and eigenvalues of C relative to D make this reverse inference unreliable unless specific properties about the commutation of C and D are known.",
