  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\) in two dimensions, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential. The complex function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) is applied to the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), with \\\\( w \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nCan the original boundary conditions of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) be deduced after observing the potential function \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) in the domain without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation could have modified the boundary conditions in a complex manner, making it difficult to recover the initial conditions uniquely especially given the influence of the complex exponential on boundary values.",
