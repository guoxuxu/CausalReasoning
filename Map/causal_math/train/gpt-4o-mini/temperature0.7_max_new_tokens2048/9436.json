  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the impact of a transformation using Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the observed Fourier transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (\\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, merely from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely indicate the specific transformations applied, as different transformations might result in similar or indistinguishable effects in the frequency domain, especially due to linear properties and overlap in the effects of \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( F(z) \\\\), and \\\\( G(z) \\\\).",
