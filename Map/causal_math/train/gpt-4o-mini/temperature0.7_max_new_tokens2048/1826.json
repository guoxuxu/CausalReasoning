  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = a+bt+ict^2 \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants, and study the application of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact original values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) after observing the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without previous data about their values?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier Transform encodes all the information about the time-domain function, extracting exact values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) requires solving an inverse problem which may not be unique without additional constraints or knowledge about the phase and original conditions.",
