  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional transformation subject to the Laplace Transform (\\\\( L \\\\)) and Inverse Laplace Transform (\\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)) when applied to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\\\\\\\, where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace Transform (\\\\( L \\\\)) to the ODE, then solve the resulting algebraic equation and finally apply the Inverse Laplace Transform (\\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)), will the solution precisely match the original solution of the ODE without applying \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming an ODE with \\\\( L \\\\) and then reversing it with \\\\( L^{-1} \\\\) after solving it algebraically keeps the system's integrity intact. The processes of Laplace and Inverse Laplace Transforms are designed to preserve the characteristics of the differential equation, ensuring that the solution is consistent with the original ODE.",
