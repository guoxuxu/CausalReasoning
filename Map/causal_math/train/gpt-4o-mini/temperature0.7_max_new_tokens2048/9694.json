  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The scenario evaluates the impact of modifying this function through an integral transform, specifically a Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) valid for \\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\).\n\nBased on the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform results in a function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), where the pole at \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\) directly reveals the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the imaginary part of the pole, therefore allowing for exact determination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
