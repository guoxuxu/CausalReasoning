  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model that describes the diffusion of a pollutant in a river, represented by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 c}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where c is the concentration of the pollutant and D is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nGiven the observed lower concentration of pollutant at a downstream location at time T, can we conclude that a clean-up intervention was definitely applied?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of lower concentrations does not necessarily imply that an intervention took place. Natural attenuation or variations in pollutant release rates could also yield similar observations. Without additional evidence, the occurrence of an intervention cannot be conclusively established.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
