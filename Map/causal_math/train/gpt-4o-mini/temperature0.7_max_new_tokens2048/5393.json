  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) representing wave propagation, where c is the wave speed. We explore the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to convert the spatial variable into the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is performed on the initial data \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and its first time derivative, and the transformed data is then evolved according to the wave equation transformed into the frequency domain, does the resulting solution at time T match the direct evolution of \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) in the spatial domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is an invertible linear transformation that converts differential operators into algebraic ones, permitting the equation in the frequency domain to directly correspond to the spatial domain equation. Thus, transforming the solution back from the frequency domain at time T will give the same result as if the wave had been evolved directly in the spatial domain.",
