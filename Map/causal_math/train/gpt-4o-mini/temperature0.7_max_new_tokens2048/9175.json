  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit where the input voltage \\\\(V_{in}(t)\\\\) is related to the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) via a transfer function defined by \\\\( I(t) = K \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(s-t)} V_{in}(s) ds \\\\), where K and A are constants.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the system is modified by adding a constant \\\\( C \\\\) to parameter \\\\( A \\\\), will this intervention ensure that \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 is solely determined by the new value of A?",
  "Explanation": "Adding \\\\( C \\\\) to \\\\( A \\\\) alters the exponent in the integral but doesn't remove the influence of past values of \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) or A before \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The output current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still reflects the composite influence of both the original and altered A values up to T.",
