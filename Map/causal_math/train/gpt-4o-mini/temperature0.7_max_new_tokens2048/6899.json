  "Problem": "Assess the interplay between a time-varying voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) applied across a linear system with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\. The output voltage across the system is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (v * h)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf at certain time \\\\( t' \\\\), an additional voltage \\\\( v'(t) = U_0 e^{i \\\\phi t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t' \\\\) remain a simple superposition of the original and the new voltage responses?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system's response to individual inputs is linear, applying an additional voltage \\\\( v'(t) \\\\) results in an additive combination of responses linearly. Thus, \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) is essentially a simple superposition of the separate responses to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v'(t) \\\\)",
