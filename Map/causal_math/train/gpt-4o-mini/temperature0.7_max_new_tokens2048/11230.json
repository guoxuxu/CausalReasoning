  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) in relation to a linear transformation system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We will inspect the impact of applying transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t on the evolution of the function z(t).\n\nCan the original input function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be effectively retrieved at t=0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T where no intervention was done aside from the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Once the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) has been applied and evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), reversing this process to find the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes impractical unless specific information about matrix A and its relation to the function's frequency, w, is known.",
