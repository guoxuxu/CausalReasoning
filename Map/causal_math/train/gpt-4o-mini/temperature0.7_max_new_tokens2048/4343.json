  "Problem": "Consider a function represented in the complex plane as \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\), which is transformed by the integral \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{z} dz\\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane that encircles the origin once and t is a parameter.\n\nIf a correction factor \\\\(h(z) = z\\\\) is applied to \\\\(f(z)\\\\) before applying the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\), will \\\\(g(z)\\\\) reduce to the simple evaluation of an integral irrespective of the value of t?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) to \\\\(f(z)\\\\) before transformation turns the function into \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\cdot z = 1\\\\). When this corrected function is transformed, the integral \\\\(\\\\int_{C} e^{zt} dz\\\\) simplifies to 0 for all t≠0 due to the nature of the integral of an exponential function along a closed path, thus ignoring variations due to t.",
