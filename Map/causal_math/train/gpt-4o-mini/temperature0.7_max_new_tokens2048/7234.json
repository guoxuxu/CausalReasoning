  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\(\\{ z(t) \\}\\) that maps complex numbers onto a complex plane. The function is defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( f(z) \\), it is impossible to determine whether the scaling by \\( e^{\\alpha T} \\) was part of the initial condition or purely a result of the exponential growth due to \\( e^{i \\omega T} \\). Consequently, \\( z_0 \\) cannot be accurately deduced from \\( z(T) \\) without this information.",
