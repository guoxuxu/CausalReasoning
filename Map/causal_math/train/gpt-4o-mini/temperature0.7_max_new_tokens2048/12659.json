  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in control theory, described by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \\\\), where \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) are polynomial functions of the complex variable s. We investigate the behavior of the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) when the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is subjected to the Fourier Transform of a step function, i.e., \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) modified by a time delay \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we ascertain whether the alteration in the input was due to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or a different manipulation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear, multiple types of input alterations (like different time delays or alterations in input amplitude) could produce similar effects on the output, making it impossible to discern from the output alone whether it was specifically \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or another form of intervention that contributed to the observed change in \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",
