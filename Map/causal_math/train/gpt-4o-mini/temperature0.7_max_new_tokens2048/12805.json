  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is used to modulate an input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The output signal is given by \\\\(y(t) = z(t) \\\\cdot x(t)\\\\). The goal is to study the changes in the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) as compared to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven \\\\(y(t)\\\\) with a known Fourier Transform, can we uniquely determine \\\\(x(t)\\\\) if we do not know \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or whether such modulation \\\\(z(t)\\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the modulation frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or even if such modulation occurred, it is ambiguous to deduce back to \\\\(x(t)\\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(x(t)\\\\) could produce similar \\\\(y(t)\\\\) signatures in the frequency domain.",
