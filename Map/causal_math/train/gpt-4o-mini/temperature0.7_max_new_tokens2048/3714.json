  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dv}{dt} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the initial condition was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we lack critical information due to the potential alteration by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). Since \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( A \\\\), and \\\\( B \\\\) can interact in complex ways, determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without this knowledge is unfeasible.",
