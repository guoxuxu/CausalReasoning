  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Rt} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention via another function \\\\( g(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{St} \\\\) (where \\\\( S \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( R \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional variable that modifies the state parallel to the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), reflecting changes induced at different instances through \\\\( T \\\\) in addition to the inherent evolution under \\\\( P \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex-valued function z(t) changes over time due to the differential equation dz/dt, which is influenced by the constants P and Q. The transformation f(z) alters the state of z(t) based on the constant R, while the intervention g(z) also modifies z(t) based on the constant S. However, the final state z(T) is determined by the initial conditions and the effects of P, independent of R and S.",
