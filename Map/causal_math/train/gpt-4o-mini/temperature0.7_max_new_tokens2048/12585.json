  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), noted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} \\\\). We examine how convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), whose Laplace transform is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system over time.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at some future time T, can we determine exactly the original functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) if \\\\( F(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The factorization of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) into \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is generally not unique unless additional information about \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is given. Multiple pairs of functions could potentially yield the same product, hence the original functions cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone.",
