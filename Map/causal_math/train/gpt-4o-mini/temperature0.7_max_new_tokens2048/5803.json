  "Problem": "Consider a system subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse being applied under different scenarios. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes an oscillatory behavior \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an alteration is made in the Laplace domain where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is multiplied by \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\), and then the inverse transform is applied, will the resulting time function reflect only the change due to the intervention, independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\) corresponds to a time-domain shift of the function. The resulting function, \\\\( f(t-1) \\\\), keeps the dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) since it transforms to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega (t-1)} \\\\). Thus the effect is not independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
