  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-dependent signal in the complex plane where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This scenario analyzes the impact of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), applied to this function and its influence over frequency domain representation.\n\nCan we precisely identify the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) of the signal, without knowing the specifics of the time-domain form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of a purely exponential time-domain function like \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) distinctly shows a peak at its corresponding frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). This characteristic allows the exact original frequency to be identified directly from the Fourier Transform.",
