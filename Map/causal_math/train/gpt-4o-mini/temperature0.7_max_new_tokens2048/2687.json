  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact through a Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\( F(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real-valued angular frequency, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is first modified by a damping function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive damping constant, and then transformed to \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\), will \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\) only represent the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) effects modified by \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) adds a damping effect, influencing the amplitude and potentially the phase of the frequency components. The resulting Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) reflects both the original oscillatory behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) combined with the exponential damping, specifically at each frequency including \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\).",
