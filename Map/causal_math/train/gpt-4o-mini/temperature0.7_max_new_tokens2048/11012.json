  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We study the effect of this transformation on the integral paths in the complex plane, specifically focusing on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) represents a path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( \\\\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\\\) where \\\\( g(z) = bz + c \\\\) was applied, can we determine the original path \\\\( C \\\\) and the nature of the transformation function \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral after the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) does not reliably encode information to revert to the original path uniquely. Multiple original paths and transformations might lead to the same resultant integral under different conditions, leading to ambiguity in deducing both the path and the transformation.",
