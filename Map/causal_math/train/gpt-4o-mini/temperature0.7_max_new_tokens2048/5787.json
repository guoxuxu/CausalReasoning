  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor of capacitance C, a resistor of resistance R, and a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t}. Using complex impedance for the circuit analysis, examine the effects of an intervention by introducing an inductor with inductance L midway through an observation period.\n\nIf an inductor L is introduced at time t_1 and the frequency \\\\omega of the voltage remains unchanged, will the steady-state current I(t) for t > t_1 depend solely on the initial R and C, ignoring the inductor's properties?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the inductor adds another reactive component to the circuit, altering the total impedance to Z = R + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\omega C} + i \\\\omega L. This change affects the steady-state current response, making it dependent on L along with R and C.",
