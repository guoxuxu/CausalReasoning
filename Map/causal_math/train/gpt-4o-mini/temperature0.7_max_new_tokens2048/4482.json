  "Problem": "Assess the effects of a Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant, and its impact on system behavior described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nGiven the system's output \\\\( x(t) \\\\), is it possible to conclusively infer whether the input was \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or its Fourier and inverse Fourier transformed counterpart without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transformed version, if perfectly transformed, should theoretically yield the same output in an ideal linear time-invariant system. However, practical factors such as numerical errors, approximations, and non-ideal behavior of real systems prevent definitive backward inference from output to specific input form.",
