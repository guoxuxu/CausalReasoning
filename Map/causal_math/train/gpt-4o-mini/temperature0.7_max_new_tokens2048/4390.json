  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. The function acts on an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\)\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) used or its parameter A?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or the matrix A, it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since different functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) corresponding to different matrices A could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from different initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
