  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We examine the interactions between the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and a linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) on function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf a modification function \\( Mf(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\) (where \\( a \\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), will the final Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[z(t)] \\) for \\( t = T \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)) depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( a \\) or the application time \\( t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( M \\) introduces an exponential factor which modifies both the amplitude and phase characteristics of \\( z(t) \\), affecting the Fourier transform. The final state will thus depend on \\( \\omega \\), \\( a \\), and \\( t_1 \\), altering the spectral properties of \\( z(t) \\).",
