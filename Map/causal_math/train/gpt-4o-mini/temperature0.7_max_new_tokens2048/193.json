  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its derivative \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it}\\\\) in a system over time, focusing on how transformations affect causal inference.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(t) = e^{-t}\\\\) is multiplied with \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t=0, and then the system is observed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it}\\\\), will the function form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t=T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was evolved without multiplying by \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\(z_0\\\\) by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) introduces a damping factor that modifies the amplitude of the complex function over time. This transformation changes the behavior of the exponential growth in the imaginary exponential function, leading to a distinct trajectory and a different \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T.",
