  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), and A and B are scalar constants. We explore causal relationships under the Fourier transform defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied where a scaling function \\\\(s(t) = e^{Ct}\\\\) is multiplied to z(t) at a time t_1, will the new state \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\) reflect only the impact of A and B or also C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the scaling function \\\\(s(t) = e^{Ct}\\\\) affects the subsequent evolution of the function by introducing a new exponential factor, significantly altering the response characteristics captured in \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\). Thus, the new transformation reflects A, B, and C.",
