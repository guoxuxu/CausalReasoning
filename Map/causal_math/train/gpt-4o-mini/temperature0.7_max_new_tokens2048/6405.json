  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t} z \\\\) is applied over time t, with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant. The system operates under the function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z'(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by rotating the complex number. This rotation alters the trajectory since the subsequent evolution magnifies these changes exponentially, resulting in a different end value at any \\\\( T > 0 \\\\).",
