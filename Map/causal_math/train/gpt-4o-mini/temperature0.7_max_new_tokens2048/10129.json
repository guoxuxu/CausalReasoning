  "Problem": "Consider a differential operator \\\\( L[y] = \\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - y \\\\) operating in a complex function space. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) on functions that are solutions to the differential equation \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at x = 0, solves \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\) and then undergoes the transformation \\\\( T[y] \\\\), will \\\\( T[y](s) \\\\) be a solution to the transformed differential equation derived from \\\\( L \\\\) under the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[y] \\\\) converts the second-order differential equation into a characteristic equation component in the Laplace transform, satisfying the associated transformed differential equation. The effect of the transformation aligns correctly with how differential operators behave under integral transforms such as the Laplace transform.",
