  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( G(z) = e^{\\mu t}z \\) (where \\( \\mu \\) is a constant complex) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the original differential equation and not on \\( \\lambda \\) or \\( \\mu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) will be influenced by both \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) along with the original system dynamics governed by \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). The exponential terms introduced by \\( F(z) \\) and \\( G(z) \\) add compound effects that affect \\( z(T) \\)'s trajectory and final state.",
