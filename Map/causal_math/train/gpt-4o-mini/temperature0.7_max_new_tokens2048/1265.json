  "Problem": "Let's consider the linear functional transformation \\\\( F(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a fixed but unknown function. We explore the consequences of applying \\\\( F(g) \\\\) to different functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) under continuous and piecewise mappings.\n\nIf \\\\( F(g) \\\\) is initially applied to a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at} \\\\) and evolved over time without any additional transformations, will the output be affected solely by the properties of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since there are no interventions, the result is purely the convolution of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), and thus dependent only on these inputs and their interaction during the integration process typical of linear transformations.",
