  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where C is a real constant representing frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) is studied over the interval \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) followed by the evolution under the original differential equation without any further intervention, would \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T diverge from the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same differential equation but without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the starting trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating the oscillatory effects influenced by the factor \\\\( e^{-iCs} \\\\), thus diverging the path from that of the untransformed initial condition.",
