  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\), where M is a matrix representing the linear operator in a complex plane. An operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), with N being another constant matrix, is applied to this system.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and is thereafter left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T conform to the original trajectory as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the original conditions of the system. The action of \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) changes the initial state depending on the interaction between N and M, which generally results in a trajectory divergent from the original if \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) do not commute.",
