  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where a and b are complex constants. We analyze how the mapping under this function and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\), where c and d are also complex constants, affect outcomes.\n\nGiven the final complex state at time T, can we precisely determine the initial transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) by observing the outcome alone?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear interaction between \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) in the complex plane, different combinations of parameters \\\\(a\\\\), \\\\(b\\\\), \\\\(c\\\\), and \\\\(d\\\\) could lead to the same outcome at time T. This overlap means we cannot uniquely backtrack to identify the exact transformations applied only by seeing the final state.",
