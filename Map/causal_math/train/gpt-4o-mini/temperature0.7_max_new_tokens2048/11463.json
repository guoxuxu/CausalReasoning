  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function scenario where the initial function is \\\\( z(t) = C t^2 + iD \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) being real numbers. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, with A being a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention by applying another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{B(T-t)}z \\\\) halfway through the evolution at \\\\( t = T/2 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be dependent only on initial parameters and not on both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further complicates the state by introducing another exponential factor dependent on \\\\( B \\\\) and time \\\\( T-t \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) now depends on the initial conditions, the effect of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and importantly, the subsequent application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial parameters C and D cause the function z(t) to be defined. Time t directly influences the value of z(t). The function f(z) is determined by the product of e^{At} and z(t). The parameter A influences the transformation f(z), which in turn affects the final value z(T). The parameter T is involved in defining the function g(z), and time t also influences g(z). The parameter B affects g(z), which subsequently impacts the final value z(T). Therefore, z(T) is dependent on both transformations f(z) and g(z) as they are both involved in the calculation of z(T).",
