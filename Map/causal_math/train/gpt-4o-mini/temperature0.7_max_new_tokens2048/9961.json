  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real parameter representing angular frequency. The function describes a pure harmonic oscillation in the complex plane. Now, consider the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve naturally without further modifications, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) reflect the direct square of the original oscillation without \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) transforms the initial condition to \\\\( z(0)^2 \\\\), thereby affecting the evolution path to \\\\( z(t)^2 \\\\) for all subsequent times. This results in a waveform that oscillates at double the original frequency (transformation to \\\\( e^{2i\\omega t} \\\\)), not merely the square of the position at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
