  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a matrix \\( M \\) is applied to vector \\( x \\) creating \\( y = Mx \\). An integral operation \\( I(f(x)) = \\int_0^T f(x(t)) dt \\) is performed to analyze the transformed vector \\( y \\) over a period \\( T \\), where \\( f(x(t)) \\) is a function dependent on vector \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven the output from \\( I(f(x)) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we determine the initial vector \\( x_0 \\) without knowing \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linking of \\( x_0 \\) to \\( y(T) \\) is through \\( M \\), and without knowing \\( M \\), the components and structure that led to \\( y(T) \\) through \\( I(f(x)) \\) can't be traced accurately.",
