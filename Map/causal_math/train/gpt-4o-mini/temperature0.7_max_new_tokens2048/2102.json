  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = xe^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. The transformation \\(\\ T : z \\mapsto z^2 \\) is applied to this function.\n\nBy observing the trajectory \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we infer whether \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) or no transformation was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Both the modified and unmodified functions can yield trajectories that intersect or overlap at certain times or conditions, making it impossible to conclusively determine the initial application of \\( T \\) from observations at a single point in time.",
