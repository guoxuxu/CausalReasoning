  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor R and an inductor L in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(V(t)\\\\) denotes the applied voltage. We introduce a transformation \\\\(g(I) = I + ct\\\\), where c is a constant, applied to the current I at time t.\n\nKnowing the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\(g(I)\\\\) was initially applied, without other interventions or information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the initial conditions or whether the transformation \\\\(g(I)\\\\) was applied, it's impossible to distinguish if the difference in current is due to initial transformation or because of natural variations in \\\\(V(t)\\\\) or other system parameters.",
