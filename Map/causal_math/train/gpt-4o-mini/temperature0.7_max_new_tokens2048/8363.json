  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the dynamics of this function under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{itunes}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a fixed real number, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = w + u \\\\) remain qualitatively different from its values at other \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\\\( e^{itunes} \\\\) shifts the frequency component from \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w+u \\\\). Correspondingly, the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z'(t)\\\\} \\\\) concentrates at \\\\( s = w+u \\\\) with a Dirac delta function, making it distinct at this frequency compared to others.",
