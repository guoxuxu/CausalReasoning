  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nIf the function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is convoluted with \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) to form \\\\( p_{new}(x) = p(x) * G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) and then Fourier transformed, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(p_{new}(x)) \\\\) strictly retain the characteristic frequencies of \\\\( F(p(x)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with a Gaussian kernel acts as a low-pass filter in the frequency domain. Although the basic frequencies of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) will still be present, their amplitudes will be altered (generally reduced), meaning the strict retention of characteristic frequencies is not guaranteed.",
