  "Problem": "Consider a model for the propagation of a signal \\\\(s(t)\\\\) through a medium, where the signal is initially transformed by a function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kx} \\\\), and the medium's response is modeled by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. The propagation is analyzed at various times t under different transformations.\n\nIf at time t = t1 a new transformation \\\\( g(y) = e^{My} \\\\) is applied to the signal as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend solely on the operator L and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a new transformation \\\\( g(y) \\\\) sets a different trajectory for the signal's evolution under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\). This means that the end state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is determined by the initial transformation \\\\( K \\\\), the intervention \\\\( M \\\\), and the dynamics of L, making it dependent on all these elements.",
