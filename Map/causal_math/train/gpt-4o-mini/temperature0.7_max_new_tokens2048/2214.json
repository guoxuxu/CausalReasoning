  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) applied to a constant vector \\( v \\) in the complex plane, where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex matrix. This scenario studies the effect of the function and the impact of an applied integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\, dt \\), with \\( B \\) being another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan the original vector \\( v \\) be uniquely determined by observing \\( z(T) = e^{AT}v \\) and knowing \\( A \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( z(T) = e^{AT}v \\) and \\( A \\), \\( v \\) can be exactly recovered by computing \\( v = e^{-AT}z(T) \\), assuming \\( A \\) is non-singular. The invertibility of \\( e^{AT} \\) allows for the precise reconstruction of \\( v \\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The fixed complex matrix A directly causes the function z(t) to be applied to the constant vector v. The constant vector v directly influences the output of the function z(t). The output of z(t) at time T, denoted as z(T), is caused by the application of the function z(t). The output z(T) can be used to determine the vector v. The constant complex matrix B directly causes the integral transformation g(z) to operate on z(t). The time variable T also influences the operation of g(z).",
