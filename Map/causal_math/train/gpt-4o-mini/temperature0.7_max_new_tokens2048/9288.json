  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from various combinations and timings of the interventions due to the complex exponential terms \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) affecting both the phase and magnitude in overlapping ways. This makes it impossible to determine the specifics of interventions uniquely from the endpoint alone.",
