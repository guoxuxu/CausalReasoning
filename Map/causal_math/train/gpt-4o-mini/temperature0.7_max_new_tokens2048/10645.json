  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function f(z) where f is an analytic function of the complex variable z. We're examining the effect of two transformations on f: multiplication by e^z, and application of the Fourier Transform denoted as F.\n\nIf the function f(z) is initially given, and e^z is multiplied without any other functional transformation, will the resulting function after transformation be an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform operator F?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplication by e^z modifies f(z) non-trivially, altering its basic properties, including its periodicity and analyticity in the domain of definition. There is no guarantee that multiplying an arbitrary analytic function by e^z will result in a function that is an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform, which typically involves a condition on the function's form and growth properties.",
