  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\). An integral transformation using a kernel \\\\( K(u,v;x,y) = e^{-(u^2+v^2)} \\\\) is applied, transforming the function to \\\\( F(u,v) = \\\\int \\\\int e^{-(u^2+v^2)}(x^2 + y^2) dx dy \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final outcome \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\) after multiple integral transformations, can we determine exactly whether the original function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) or the later transformation \\\\( G(u,v) \\\\) had a more significant influence?",
  "Explanation": "It is challenging to quantify the influence of the original function versus subsequent transformations purely based on the outcome \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\). Each transformation can significantly change and mask the effects of the others, resulting in an outcome reflective of an integrated influence rather than distinct contributory effects.",
