  "Problem": "Investigate the effects of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, on a real variable system \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) under both normal evolution and perturbed conditions.\n\nIf a modification function \\\\( h(x) = x + \\cos(t) \\\\) is applied at a certain time t = T, will the future behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) beyond T depend entirely on the original \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the intervention \\\\( h(x) = x + \\cos(t) \\\\), the effects on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) post-intervention are strictly a result of the added cosine term and the ongoing progression of \\\\( t^2 \\\\). The function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), being separate and not interacting with the dynamics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), does not influence the outcome beyond T.",
