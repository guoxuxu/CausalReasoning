  "Problem": "In a controlled heat transfer system, the temperature function, \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution according to the function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), introducing another function \\\\( g(x) = e^{-bx} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant), will the temperature profile at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be dictated solely by the initial thermal diffusivity constant \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention via \\\\( g(x) \\\\) further modifies the temperature distribution, thereby affecting subsequent heat propagation. The final temperature state will depend on both the effects of \\\\( k \\\\), and the combined influences of the transformations introduced by \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature distribution function f(x) influences the initial temperature T(x,0). The function g(x) introduced at time t1 affects the temperature at later times T(x,t). The thermal diffusivity constant k determines the temperature profile T(x,t) over time. The temperature at time t depends on both the initial conditions and the thermal diffusivity, and this relationship continues to evolve at subsequent times.",
