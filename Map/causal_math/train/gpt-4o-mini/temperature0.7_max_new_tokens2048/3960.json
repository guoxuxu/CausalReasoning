  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the outcome when the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is used, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nCan we unequivocally determine which transformations were applied (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the observed final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), deducing the precise transformations applied is ambiguous due to possible equivalence in outcomes from different parameter combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). The compounded exponential effects obscure the individual contributions of the transformations, requiring additional information to disentangle.",
