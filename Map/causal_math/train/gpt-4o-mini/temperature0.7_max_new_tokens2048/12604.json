  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\), where C is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where D is a linear operator and S is an invertible matrix, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adjusts the initial condition via the operator \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Dt}S \\\\) which rescales and rotates the vector, thus altering the trajectory. Consequently, the state at time T will differ due to these changes, unless D and C are related in such a way that their exponentials commute over time through S.",
