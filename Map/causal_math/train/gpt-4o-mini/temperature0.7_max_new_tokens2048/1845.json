  "Problem": "In this system, we consider the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We will explore the consequences of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Ke^{Mt}z\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(M\\\\) is another diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T be equivalent to if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was just directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\) changes the initial condition to \\\\(Ke^{M0}z_0 = Kz_0\\\\), altering the starting point of the system. Radiating effects due to the matrix \\\\(K\\\\) interfaced with \\\\(D\\\\)'s dynamics render the evolved state at time T distinct from merely advancing \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(D\\\\).",
