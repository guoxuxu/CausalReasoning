  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional region. An external source modifies the boundary conditions at specific points through a function represented by \\\\(v(x, y) = e^{i\\\\omega(x+y)}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an additional boundary modifying function \\\\(w(x, y) = e^{-i\\\\omega(x+y)}\\\\) is applied at a later time t1, would the end state of \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at time t = T (T > t1) be unaffected by the initial function \\\\(v(x, y)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\(w(x, y)\\\\) at t1 will additively interfere with the initial condition set by \\\\(v(x, y)\\\\) due to the superpositional properties of solutions to the Laplace equation. The final form of \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at time T will reflect the influence of both boundary modifications.",
