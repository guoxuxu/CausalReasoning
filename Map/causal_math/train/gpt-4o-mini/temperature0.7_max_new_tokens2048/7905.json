  "Problem": "Using a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in a dynamical system, analyze its evolution under a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} - az \\\\) with a real constant a. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t) is considered.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( Lz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved under \\\\( Lz \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without applying \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alters the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), changing the initial state by focusing on specific frequencies. When evolved subsequently under \\\\( Lz \\\\), the transformed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will not evolve in the same way as the original would have, displaying different behavior at time T due to modified initial conditions.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves under the operator L, which leads to the second derivative of z minus a times z influencing its future state. Applying the Fourier transform F(z) to z(t) at t=0 sets the initial condition for the evolution of z(t) under L. The application of F(z) at t=0 results in an initial state that is then evolved under the operator L, which is influenced by the constant a.",
