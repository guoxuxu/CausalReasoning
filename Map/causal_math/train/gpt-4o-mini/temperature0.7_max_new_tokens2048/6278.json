  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The system's behavior is modified by applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), it is challenging to trace back the initial state accurately because the transformation \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) could have changed the initial conditions in a non-reversible way, mainly if \\\\( F \\\\) does not commute with \\\\( C \\\\) or interact trivially with \\\\( D \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The control input u(t) directly influences the state x, which subsequently evolves into the state x(t).
