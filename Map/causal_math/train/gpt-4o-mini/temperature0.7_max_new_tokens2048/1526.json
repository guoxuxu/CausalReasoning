  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a plate is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of an initial transformation using Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x \\\\cdot \\\\xi} u(x, 0) \\\\, dx \\\\) and study the system evolution.\n\nCan we determine the exact initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the observed temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the heat equation is linear and the Fourier transform is a linear isomorphism in proper function spaces, it is possible to correctly reconstruct \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the information at any later time T using the inverse Fourier transform and the known effects of \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) on the evolution.",
