  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a series of transforms: firstly by Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), followed by a scaling function in the frequency domain \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then by inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\). Analyze the impact of this transformation chain and its effect on the time-domain behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to the signal after the Fourier transform but before the scaling, will the final signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be independent of the nature of this intervention, \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) directly affects the frequency spectrum of the signal before scaling, thus altering the final output after the inverse Fourier transform. The resultant signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will depend critically on the effects of \\\\( T \\\\) in the frequency domain.",
