  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We study the implications of a Laplace transformation given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) on this function over the complex variable z.\n\nIf we modify the function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\) by changing A to B and apply the Laplace transformation at a later point, will the outcome \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\) depend only on the new matrix B without any influence of A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention where A is replaced by B means the new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\) is distinct from the original and varies only due to B when transformed. The effect of A is completely overridden by B in this scenario.",
