  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) which is transformed via a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. The function \\\\( f \\\\) maps inputs from a two-dimensional space into the complex plane, and \\\\( g \\\\) transforms these complex numbers over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( g \\\\) to \\\\( g'(z) = z^3 + c \\\\), will the outcome at time T strictly reveal the effects of the original transformation \\\\( g \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the dynamics from \\\\( g \\\\) to \\\\( g' \\\\), fundamentally altering the trajectory of the evolution from that point onwards. The final output at time T will be a result of both the original and modified transformations, making it dependent on both \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( g' \\\\).",
