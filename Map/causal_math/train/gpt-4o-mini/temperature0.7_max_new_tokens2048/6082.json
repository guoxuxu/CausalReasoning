  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a product's inventory is driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant decay rate describing how quickly items are sold or perish. We study the behavior when applying the function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\), a sales strategy intended to reduce prices as inventory decreases, thereby potentially influencing sales rate.\n\nAfter observing the inventory level \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at a later time t, can we clearly determine the initial inventory \\\\( x(0) \\\\) without knowledge about whether the function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without being certain if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, assumptions about initial levels based solely on standard decay could be inaccurate. Since \\\\( g(x) \\\\) affects initial sales dynamics, lacking this knowledge leads to potential misestimation of \\\\( x(0) \\\\).",
