  "Problem": "Assess the interplay between a time-varying voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) applied across a linear system with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\. The output voltage across the system is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (v * h)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are increased by a factor, without any other intervention, will the response function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) scale proportionally?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear, increasing \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by a constant factor proportionally scales \\\\( v(t) \\\\), when convolved with a linear system's impulse response, results in the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) being scaled by the same factor, thus demonstrating the principle of superposition.",
