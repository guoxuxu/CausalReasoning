  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined through the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We want to examine the effects of multiplying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by another function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), which represents an integral operator, on the original time-domain function z(t).\n\nIf the Laplace transform of a modified function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is given as \\\\( W(s) = Z(s) \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we infer that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was originally transformed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the structure \\\\( W(s) = Z(s) \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), it indicates that \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s Laplace transform was multiplied by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), matching the definition of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Hence, it reveals that \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was indeed used to transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
