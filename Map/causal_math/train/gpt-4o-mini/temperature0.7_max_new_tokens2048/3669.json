  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyzing the system under the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is given as zero and the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at any s satisfy the equation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With \\\\( z(0) = 0 \\\\), the differential equation simplifies in the Laplace domain to \\\\( sZ(s) - z(0) = -i\\\\omega Z(s) + \\\\frac{k}{s} \\\\), which gives \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\). The system's evolution directly follows from the Laplace transformation of the governing equation without any external modification.",
