  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(z(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a given function and \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the behavior of this transformation, specifically how it behaves under modifications of \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n\nIf at some point the function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is replaced by a modified function \\\\(g(x) = b f(x)\\\\) where \\\\(b\\\\) is another scalar, and then \\\\(z(w)\\\\) is calculated, will the final \\\\(z(w)\\\\) be independent of the initial scalar \\\\(a\\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of changing \\\\(f(x)\\\\) to \\\\(g(x) = b f(x)\\\\) results in a such that \\\\\\\\(z(w)\\\\\\\\) computed afterward reflects combined effect of both \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\). Therefore, the resulting transform \\\\(z(w)\\\\) depends on both scalars, not just one.",
