  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where heat conduction through a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature at position \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the temperature at a particular point according to the function \\\\(h(x, t) = e^{−at}sin(bx)\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is introduced at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) along the entire rod, and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\) without any additional intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(t = T\\\\) reflect the same pattern as \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial imposition of \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) changes the initial temperature distribution, but as time progresses, the heat equation tends to diffuse these variations smoothly across the rod, diminishing the initial sinusoidal pattern imposed by \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) due to the exponential decay term \\\\(e^{−at}\\\\).",
