  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant frequency. To analyze this, a transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\phi(z) =  \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t)z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is also a real constant, is applied at various times.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( \\\\phi(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the initial transformation \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t) \\\\) alters the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Without knowing this, it's impossible to uniquely determine what \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was, as the rotational effect of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) on the trajectory could replicate or obscure various initial conditions.",
