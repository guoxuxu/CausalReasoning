  "Problem": "Let's examine the interplay between two complex functions, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{-iωt} \\\\), in the context of a complex plane traversal. The complex exponentials represent rotation dynamics in the complex plane, with \\\\( ω \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf we initialize a system at \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) and allow it to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without intervention, will the trajectory at time T be the same as if we directly applied \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T to the initial point?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the exponential function and the lack of external influence, the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) inherently traces out the arc \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\), arriving at the same position at time T as if \\\\( z(T) = e^{iωT} \\\\) had been applied directly.",
