  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a spatially varying coefficient. The impact of the initial transformation by Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[u(x,0)](s) \\\\) is studied over time t.\n\nCan we determine the original function u(x,0) after observing u(x,t) at any time t, without knowing the results from the Laplace transform or any other initial transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and first-order nature of the partial differential equation and assuming a(x) is known and properly handled, it’s typically possible to trace back to the original state u(x,0) uniquely by solving the equation backwards in time from any subsequent state u(x,t).",
