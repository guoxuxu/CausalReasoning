  "Problem": "In the context of signal processing, consider a system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) passes through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We study the causal inference of output \\( y(t) \\) resulting from the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) applied to \\( x(t) \\) with frequency representation \\( X(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and similarly \\( Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = H(\\omega)X(\\omega) \\), where \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the transfer function of the system.\n\nAssuming an intervention alters \\( x(t) \\) at time \\( t_0 \\) by adding a delta function \\( \\delta(t-t_0) \\), will this modification independently affect \\( y(t) \\) conditioned only by \\( H(\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\( \\delta(t-t_0) \\) translates to an additional component in \\( X(\\omega) \\). Given the LTI property of the system, the new \\( y(t) \\) results solely from the convolution of \\( x(t) + \\delta(t-t_0) \\) with \\( h(t) \\), thereby affecting \\( y(t) \\) conditioned only by \\( H(\\omega) \\).",
