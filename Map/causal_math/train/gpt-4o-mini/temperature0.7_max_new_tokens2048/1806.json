  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz + D\\\\), where C is a matrix and D is a vector constant. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Mz + N \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector, at an initial time t = 0.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the differential equation, without knowledge of M or N, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of both M and N, the transformation applied at the initial time, reconstructing the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or confirming the use of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is impossible. Various combinations of M, N, and untransformed \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making the determination ambiguous.",
