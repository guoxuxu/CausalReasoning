  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by \\\\( z = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We examine the response of the system under a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), which acts on \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine the starting condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) of the system at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) maps directly back to the delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), knowing \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) allows exact determination of the starting condition, \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), based on the unaltered evolution of the system.",
