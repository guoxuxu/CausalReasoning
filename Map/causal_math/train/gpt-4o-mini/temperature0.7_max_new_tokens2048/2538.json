  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. We investigate how the function affects solutions to the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\), where M is another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) at z = Z, can we determine the original vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at z = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) has been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it would be ambiguous whether the observed \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) resulted from a direct application of the differential equation or was modified by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\). The effect of K on the differential path might completely mask the contributions of the original state unless K is a zero matrix.",
