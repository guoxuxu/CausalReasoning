  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = 2tz \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the given differential equation from time 0 to T without intervention, will the result of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) from 0 to T be the same as directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved up to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modulated by \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\) over time, which differentiates it from merely evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) up to time T under the differential equation. The function \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\) affects the weighting of each state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) throughout the integration process, ultimately resulting in a different outcome than simply evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
