  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), and consider its Laplace transform, which gives a function in the complex plane. Assume that this function represents the transfer function of a control system, where a and b are constants.\n\nIf an external intervention modifies the parameters a and b of the function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) at a certain time, will the system's subsequent output depend solely on the new values of a and b and not on their historical values?",
  "Explanation": "No, because the system's behavior and output are influenced by the entire history of the parameters a and b, not just their values immediately following the intervention. Changes in these parameters can affect the stability and transient response, thus impacting the output over time.",
