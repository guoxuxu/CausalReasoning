  "Problem": "In a closed-loop control system, the controlled process is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a fixed matrix. An external controller intervenes using a function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) where D is a control matrix and t represents time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was only evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) at the initial time changes the starting state. This modified initial condition under the influence of \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) causes the system's trajectory to diverge from what would have been purely under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\). As a result, the state at any future time T will differ unless D and M are specially related (e.g., commuting matrices).",
