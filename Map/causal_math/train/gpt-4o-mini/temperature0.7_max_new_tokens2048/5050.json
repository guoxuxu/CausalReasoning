  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We assess the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{iBt} \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a real constant, and investigate how it influences the behavior over time t.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( x \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied, the transformation \\\\( e^{iBT} \\\\) could have altered the observed outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) in a way that cannot be uniquely traced back, especially since complex exponentials do not provide unique reverse paths when additional multiplicative transformations may have occurred.",
