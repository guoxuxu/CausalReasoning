  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its influence on a real function defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}F(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex variable. We analyze how transformations and interventions using a separate complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) affect the output of g(x).\n\nGiven the output function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), can we determine whether the initial input was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\) could potentially map to similar outputs depending on the contours of integration and singularities handled, it's impractical to deduce the original input form without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\).",
