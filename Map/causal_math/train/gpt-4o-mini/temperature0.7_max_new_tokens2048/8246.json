  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. Examine the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), any observed dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot reliably indicate the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could have altered its magnitude and phase in a manner indistinguishable solely from end state observations.",
