  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt \\\\), a Laplace transform operating on a function w(t). We explore changes induced by modifying w(t) either through a polynomial scaling \\\\( p(t) = t^n \\\\) or an exponential modifier \\\\( q(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform z(w') of the modified function w'(t) = t^n w(t), can we directly infer the original function w(t) without knowing n?",
  "Explanation": "The new transform z(w') reflects the polynomial modification, and without knowledge of the degree n of the polynomial applied, the characteristics of the original function w(t), such as its rate of change or initial behavior, cannot be determined unambiguously from z(w').",
