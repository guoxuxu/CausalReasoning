  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, defined by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) by applying a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), does \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) still solely depend on the initial condition and \\\\( a \\\\), but not on the specific form of \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) alters the state of \\\\( u \\\\), thus changing the result of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) as both the heat equation and the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) are sensitive to changes in the spatial profile of \\\\( u \\\\). The specific characteristics of \\\\( D \\\\) will affect the resulting transformed state at any subsequent time, including \\\\( T \\\\).",
