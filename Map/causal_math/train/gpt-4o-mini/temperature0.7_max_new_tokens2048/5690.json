  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) representing a solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at different times \\\\( t \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) uniquely by only analyzing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at some later time T, assuming the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Fourier transform is invertible and transforms linearly, knowing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) allows us to uniquely reconstruct the transformed initial condition \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\), and subsequently \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier transform.",
