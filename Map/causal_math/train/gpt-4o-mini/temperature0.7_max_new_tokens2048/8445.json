  "Problem": "Consider the operation of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where the function describes a physical or mathematical system. We explore how changes in function through multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\( e^{st} \\) impacts the system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by a complex exponential \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) and then a Laplace transform is applied, is the resulting transformation equivalent to simply applying the Laplace transform to the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) and applying the Laplace transform results in a translation of the original transform in the complex plane. Specifically, the transform of \\\\( e^{st}f(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is the coefficient in \\\\( st \\\\), altering the poles and zeros of the original transform.",
