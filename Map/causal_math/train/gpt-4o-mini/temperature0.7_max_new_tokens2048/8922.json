  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(t) =  ∫_0^t e^{st} h(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given function. We study how changes in \\\\( h(s) \\\\) influence the graph of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) given that \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nObserving the modified function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), can we determine the exact value of the constant \\\\( c \\\\) added to \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in all cases?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( c \\\\) might be indeterminable unless specific conditions on \\\\( s \\\\) (such as \\\\( s ≠ 0 \\\\)) are known that prevent certain degeneracies (like if \\\\( s = 0 \\\\), then the factor \\\\( \\\\frac{e^{st} - 1}{s} \\\\) necessitates a limit interpretation). Without these, it's not always possible to reverse-engineer the constant added.",
