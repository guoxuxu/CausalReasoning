  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a continuous function. The transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) is explored, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an adjustment \\\\( h(t) = g(t) e^{ct} \\\\) is applied at a certain point where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, does \\\\( H(s) \\\\) equal \\\\( F(s - a - c) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention, \\\\( h(t) = g(t) e^{ct} = f(t) e^{at} e^{ct} = f(t) e^{(a+c)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), denoted \\\\( H(s) \\\\), is \\\\( F(s - a - c) \\\\) by applying the shift property successively. Hence, every adjustment changes the domain in the Laplace space consistently by the respective additive constants.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function f(t) transforms into g(t) through the multiplication by e^(at), and g(t) further transforms into h(t) through the multiplication by e^(ct).
