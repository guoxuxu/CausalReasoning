  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), within a system governed by the linear differential operator \\\\( L(z) = \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 z \\\\). Analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( L(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the outcome at a later time T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( L(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the initial condition from a single complex number to a function of time, thus changing the dynamic response of the system under the differential operator \\\\( L(z) \\\\). This evolution will not correspond to the simple evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( L(z) \\\\), because the transformation introduces an integration that dissipates the initial conditions over time.",
