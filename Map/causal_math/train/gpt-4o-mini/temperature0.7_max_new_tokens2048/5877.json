  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral around a simple closed path C in the complex plane. We explore the integral transformation defined by the power series expansion \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n z^n \\\\), where \\\\( a_n \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the domain enclosed by C, and then the integral transformation of \\\\( z \\\\) around C is computed without further intervention, will the integral \\\\( \\\\oint_C g(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) be the same as the integral of the transformation of \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\) under the same path?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) around the path C depends on the analytical properties of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and not just on the value at \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Due to the power series expansion and potential singularities or points of non-analyticity within the interior of C, the behavior of \\\\( g \\\\) over C differs fundamentally from applying \\\\( g \\\\) just at a point.",
