  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact when subjected to a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( j(z) = z^m \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another positive integer) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( n \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) = z^m \\\\) further modifies the trajectory, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\), as well as \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The exponents accumulate, reflecting the compound transformations applied sequentially.",
