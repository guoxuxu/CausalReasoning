  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^2 f(z) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the resultant function at a later time \\\\( t \\\\) solely depend on the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying by \\\\( z^2 \\\\) introduces a significant change in the behavior and the Fourier transform of the function. This polynomial modification affects both the scale and nature of the frequency components, in addition to the factors introduced by the differential equation.",
