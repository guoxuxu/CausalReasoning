  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with D being a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the function at initial time t = 0, namely \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made at time t = t' > 0, such as multiplying \\\\( u(x, t') \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t' be solely dependent on D and not on the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the state of the system at t = t', and this modification impacts the subsequent transformation and evolution of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The Fourier transform of this modified state would depend not only on D but also significantly on the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
