  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a step function. We apply the Laplace transform to this signal and analyze various influence scenarios within the Laplace transform space.\n\nIf an additional frequency component \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) is introduced at time \\\\(t = T > 0\\\\), modifying \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta)t}u(t)\\\\), does the new Laplace transform reflect only the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) without showing the impact of \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a frequency shift \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) changes the frequency components of the signal, and thus the Laplace transform will embody this change, yielding a transform such as piecewise definitions combining different terms for varying time intervals reflecting both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\delta\\\\).",
