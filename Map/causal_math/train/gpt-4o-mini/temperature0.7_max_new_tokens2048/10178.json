  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of functions over complex domains and examine the impact of an integral transformation. Let \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) be defined on the complex plane minus the origin z = 0 and let an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_{C} f(z) dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin.\n\nGiven the result of the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = 2\\\\pi i \\\\), can we definitively infer that the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had a simple pole at z = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\) is characteristic of the integral of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) around a closed contour enclosing z = 0. This outcome can only arise from a function with a simple pole at the origin, therefore accurately pointing back to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) having a simple pole.",
