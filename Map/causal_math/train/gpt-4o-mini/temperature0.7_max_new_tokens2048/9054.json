  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined as the convolution of two functions x and h on a real line, denoted as z(t) = (x * h)(t). This convolution operation represents the integral of the product of x shifted by -s and h, as function of s from negative to positive infinity. The analysis focuses on how differentiating z with respect to t, as well as considering the Fourier transform of x and h, impacts the resulting function.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of x just by observing z, without knowing h?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution z(t) = (x * h)(t) blends the characteristics of x and h such that without knowing h, it is impossible to uniquely recover x from z. There are potentially multiple functions x that could result in the same z for different h.",
