  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in complex function space described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We analyze the effect of the transformation function \\\\( f(z) = ze^{Bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) only by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of the parameters \\\\( A, B, \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), along with different timings for the interventions, might yield the same or highly similar endpoints, resulting in non-unique solutions and indeterminate intervention histories without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial complex value z_0 influences the value of z(t) through the transformation defined by A. The real constant A directly causes the transformation over time t, resulting in z(t). The value of z(t) subsequently influences the function f(z), which is also affected by the real constant B and time t. The transformed value z(t) leads to the endpoint z(T), and f(z) also contributes to z(T) based on its application.",
