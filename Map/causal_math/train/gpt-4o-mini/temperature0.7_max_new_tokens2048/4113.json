  "Problem": "We examine a signal transformation using the Laplace transform in an electrical circuit. The input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is studied in the Laplace domain by applying \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), respectively.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is altered to \\\\( x'(t) = x(t) + \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\), and then transformed without further interference, will \\\\( Y'(s) = Y(s) + \\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) describe the output accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, due to the linearity and time-invariance of the system. The addition of \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) directly translates in the Laplace domain to adding \\\\( \\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) to \\\\( X(s) \\\\), thus the altered output \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) will accurately reflect this input change.",
