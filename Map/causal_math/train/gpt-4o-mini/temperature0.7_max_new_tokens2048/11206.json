  "Problem": "In a complex analysis setting, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and t represents time. The impact of the integral transformation defined by a convolution integral \\\\( g(t) = (h * z)(t) \\\\) over time t, with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another function, is analyzed.\n\nBased on the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) observed at time T, can we unequivocally reconstruct the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) used in the convolution?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution mixes multiple time instances of function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), smeared by \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it is impossible to deconvolute the contributions uniquely and recover the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
