  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) in which both x and y are differentiable real-valued functions of t. We apply a transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) where A is a constant real number and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain the specific interventions applied (whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\), \\\\( u(z) \\\\), or both), solely through the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is uncertain due to the alterations each transformation makes on the phase and amplitude independently. The transformations \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) can yield equivalent results at certain configurations, obscuring which interventions were used.",
