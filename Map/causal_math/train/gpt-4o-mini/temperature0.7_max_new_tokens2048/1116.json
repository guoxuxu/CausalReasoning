  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform, subjected to a filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then converted back using the inverse Fourier transform. Let's denote the output signal as \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(s) \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t))) \\\\).\n\nCan the application of any potential filters like \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( H(s) \\\\) be determined unequivocally by analyzing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Since different combinations of filters can yield similar or even identical transformations in the frequency domain, it is not possible to uniquely determine which specific filters were applied just by examining the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The conversion is not bijective, allowing for multiple potential filter configurations producing the same output.",
