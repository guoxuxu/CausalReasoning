  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit where the input voltage \\\\(V_{in}(t)\\\\) is related to the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) via a transfer function defined by \\\\( I(t) = K \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(s-t)} V_{in}(s) ds \\\\), where K and A are constants.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) at all times t = 0 to T by only measuring \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transfer function involves an integration over time, which means multiple forms of \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) could lead to the same \\\\( I(T) \\\\). This smearing effect prevents the exact determination of \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) from \\\\( I(T) \\\\) alone.",
