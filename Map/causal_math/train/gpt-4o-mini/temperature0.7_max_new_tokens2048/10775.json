  "Problem": "A mechanical system's position as a function of time is determined by the integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p(t) \\\\dot{x} + q(t)x = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) are given functions. We analyze the impact of a control intervention defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = x + ct^2 \\\\) where c is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(x) = x + ct^2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution, will the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the coefficients \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) and not on the value of c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the position trajectory by adding a quadratic function of time, which means that the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will also depend on the magnitude of c, not just on the coefficients \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\). This additional dependence could significantly affect the evolution of the position.",
