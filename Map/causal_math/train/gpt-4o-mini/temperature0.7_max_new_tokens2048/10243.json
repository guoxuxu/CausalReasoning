  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by \\\\( z = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We examine the response of the system under a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), which acts on \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant phase shift) is applied at time t_1, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T > t_1 still only depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional phase shift modifies the complex function by a constant phase, influencing the Fourier transform output. This change results in a shift in the phase of the spectrum, thereby making \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) dependent not just on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the added \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).",
