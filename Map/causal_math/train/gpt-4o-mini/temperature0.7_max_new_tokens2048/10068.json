  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic model where the temperature of a system \\\\( T \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of an initial condition modification characterized by \\\\( T(x,0) = T_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a heat source distribution function.\n\nCan we determine exactly which heat sources were applied (\\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) at earlier times only by analyzing the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) does not uniquely determine the history of heat source applications. Various combinations of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( k(x) \\\\) could produce the same final temperature profile due to overlapping effects and the properties of thermal diffusion.",
