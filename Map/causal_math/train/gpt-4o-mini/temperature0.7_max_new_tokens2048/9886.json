  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(w) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\), mapped over the complex plane. We are interested in examining the changes in the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed contour in the w-plane, particularly under the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\).\n\nAfter computing the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) for a transformed contour, can we infer the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) precisely without knowledge whether transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\) could significantly alter the original contour, distinguishing between the original and transformed contours merely from the integral value is generally not possible without knowing whether the transformation was applied. Any transformation effects inherently modify the original path in potentially irreversible ways.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The variable w is transformed to z(w), which is then integrated over a closed contour C, resulting in the integral of z(w) dw. The transformation T(w) leads to a transformed contour, which also results in the integral of z(w) dw, indicating that the integral depends on the contour used. However, the original contour C cannot be precisely inferred without knowing whether the transformation T(w) was applied.",
