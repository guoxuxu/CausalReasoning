  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Fourier transform on a time series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and consider an operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to it. We consider the variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the frequency domain with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( X(s) \\\\), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is a filter applied in the frequency domain, will filtering \\\\( X(s) \\\\) with \\\\( H(s) \\\\) produce the same result as directly filtering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with its corresponding time-domain filter?",
  "Explanation": "Convolution in time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. Therefore, filtering \\\\( X(s) \\\\) by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is equivalent to convolving \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with the corresponding inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The outcome remains consistent due to the properties of the Fourier transform whether applied before or after transformation.",
