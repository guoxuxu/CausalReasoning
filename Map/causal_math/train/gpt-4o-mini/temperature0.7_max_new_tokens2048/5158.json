  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are also complex constants.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g \\\\), and due to the non-invertibility and non-linearity of \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( w \\\\). Moreover, the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) can map different starting values to the same result under \\\\( f \\\\).",
