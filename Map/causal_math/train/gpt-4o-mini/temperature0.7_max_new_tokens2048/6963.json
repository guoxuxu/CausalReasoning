  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of a real variable, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this signal, represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation represented by a windowing function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier Transform, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be affected solely by the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without any influence from \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a window function modifies the original signal by element-wise multiplication, which affects the spectrum of the resultant signal. The Fourier Transform of the modified signal will thus be a convolution of the spectra of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\), distinctly influenced by the properties of both.",
