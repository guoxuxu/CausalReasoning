  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a function space, defined as L[f(x)] = f''(x) - 4f(x). We are interested in how the use of an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform denoted by \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), affects the solutions of the differential equation L[f(x)] = 0.\n\nGiven F(s), the Laplace Transform of a function, and knowing it solves the transformed Laplace equation derived from L[f(x)] = 0, can we determine the original function f(x) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "If F(s) solves the transformed equation in the Laplace domain and you know the initial conditions \\( f(0) \\) and \\( f'(0) \\), you can uniquely determine the original function f(x) by applying the inverse Laplace Transform. This recovery of f(x) is possible provided the required initial conditions are known and the function F(s) satisfies the assumptions of the transform.",
