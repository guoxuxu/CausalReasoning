  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = T, is it possible to determine if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and lack of further information on how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved over time, we cannot uniquely determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied originally — especially since both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) contribute complex rotations that could result in similar outcomes at time T.",
