  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier Transform scenario where a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) is transformed into its Fourier counterpart \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and affected by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(x) = e^{-a x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and then convoluted with the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will the inverse Fourier transform of the convolution produce the same function as the initial \\\\( f(x) \\\\) convoluted with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) in the spatial domain?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier transforms. Consequently, convolving \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) directly or transforming, multiplying, and reversing the transform will yield the same result due to the properties of the Fourier transform and convolution.",
