  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nCan we determine the exact angle of phase shift \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) in the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) by observing the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift introduced by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) directly corresponds to a uniform shift in the phase spectrum of the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\). By analyzing the phase spectrum, the angle \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) can be exactly determined, showing a definitive causal inference from effect to specific cause.",
