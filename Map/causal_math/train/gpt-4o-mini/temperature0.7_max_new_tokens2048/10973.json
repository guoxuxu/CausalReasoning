  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Fourier Transform on a given function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant. The Fourier Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( G(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\\\pi ft} dt \\\\). Analyze the outcomes of various implementation scenarios and their reverse causality.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform is applied to the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and subsequently evolved under normal Fourier properties, will \\\\( G(f) \\\\) at a frequency \\\\( f \\\\) remain constant over time?",
  "Explanation": "Once the Fourier Transform is taken, \\\\( G(f) \\\\), being a transformation in the frequency domain, is not dependent on time evolution unless the functional or operational parameters change, which is not mentioned in the scenario. Thus, it remains constant.",
