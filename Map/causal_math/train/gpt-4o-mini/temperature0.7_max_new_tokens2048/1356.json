  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates over time. We study the effect of a Laplace Transform \\\\( F(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(p) \\\\) which transforms the complex-valued function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) after the sinusoidal intervention, can we precisely infer the amplitude \\\\( A \\\\) of the external force used?",
  "Explanation": "Although the spectral characteristics introduced by the sinusoidal force affect \\\\( F(p) \\\\), precisely inferring the amplitude \\\\( A \\\\) just from \\\\( F(p) \\\\) is challenging due to potential overlaps with intrinsic characteristics of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), as well as dependencies on the system's response characteristics.",
