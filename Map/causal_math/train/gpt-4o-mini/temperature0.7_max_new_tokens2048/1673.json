  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model involving a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) a real number frequency parameter. The integral transform of this function with respect to time using the Laplace transform is analyzed.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is doubled from \\\\(\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(2\\omega\\\\) at time t = 0 and left unchanged, will the Laplace transform of the new function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i 2\\omega t}\\\\) at a later time T be equivalent to the Laplace transform of the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the frequency modifies the function fundamentally, affecting oscillation speed. Since Laplace transforms are sensitive to frequency changes, the result for \\\\(z(t) = e^{i 2\\omega t}\\\\) differs from that of \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\), specifically in the exponential term and the resultant frequency in the s-domain.",
