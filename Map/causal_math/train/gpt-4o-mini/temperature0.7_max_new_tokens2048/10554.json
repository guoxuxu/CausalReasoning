  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} x(s) ds \\\\), with A being a constant square matrix. The input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using the function \\\\( g(t, x) = e^{Bt} x \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) after observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) was applied, it is not possible to accurately trace back to the original form of \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) because the transformation via \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could have significantly altered the input, affecting the resultant function \\\\( y(T) \\\\) in a way that does not uniquely correspond to any specific \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\).",
