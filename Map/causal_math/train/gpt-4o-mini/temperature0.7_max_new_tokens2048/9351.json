  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor having capacitance C described by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\\\omega^2 q = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q\\\\) is the charge on the capacitor and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. Investigate the transformation of the system state when subjected to an external sinusoidal voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied such as changing the capacitance to \\\\(C'\\\\) at time t = \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) for t > \\\\(t_1\\\\) depend solely on the new capacitance value \\\\(C'\\\\) and not on the original \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) will depend on both the new capacitance \\\\(C'\\\\) and the conditions of the circuit prior to \\\\(t_1\\\\), including the original capacitance \\\\(C\\\\). Transient dynamics just after \\\\(t_1\\\\) will affect how the circuit adjusts to this new parameter, making the response dependent on both capacitances.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The capacitance C influences the charge q on the capacitor, and the external voltage V(t) also affects the charge q. When the capacitance is changed to C' at time t = t_1, the behavior of the charge q for times greater than t_1 is determined by the new capacitance C' rather than the original capacitance C.",
