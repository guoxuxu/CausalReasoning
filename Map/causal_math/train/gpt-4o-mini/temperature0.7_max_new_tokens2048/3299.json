  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function is evaluated and then transformed using the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). The system's behavior over the complex plane is considered under this transformation.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by altering \\\\( A \\\\) to a new matrix \\\\( B \\\\) at some moment, and then the Fourier transform is reapplied, will the characteristics of the new transform at any point only depend on \\\\( B \\\\) and not on the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the underlying function to \\\\( f'(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\), but the extents to which characteristics of the transform depend solely on \\\\( B \\\\) are influenced by the state of the system at the moment of intervention. The history embedded by \\\\( A \\\\) prior to changing it to \\\\( B \\\\) affects the overall transformation, yielding dependency on both matrices.",
