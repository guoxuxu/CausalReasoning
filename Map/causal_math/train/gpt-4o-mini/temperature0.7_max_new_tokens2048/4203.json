  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation function \\\\( U \\\\) defined as \\\\( Uz(t) = z(t) + Dz(t-1) \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as intervention, and considering the influence of \\\\( T \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U \\\\) introduces a dependency not only on the initial matrices A and B but also significantly on C and D due to the transformations. Each transformation potentially alters the trajectory in distinct ways that depend on their respective matrices, leading to differential final states at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
