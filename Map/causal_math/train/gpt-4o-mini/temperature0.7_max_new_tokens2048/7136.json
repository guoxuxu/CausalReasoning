  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. For this scenario, let's investigate the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined as an integral transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven knowledge of the transformed function \\\\( F(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T, can one determine whether an intervention (Fourier transform) was applied instead of pure evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform alters the function to its frequency spectrum and affects the natural time-domain growth of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the properties of \\\\( F(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T, specifically being a function of frequency components, can be distinctly different from exponential growth, indicating the intervention.",
