  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\Delta u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a complex function of a spatial variable. We investigate how the application of Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\), impacts the causal inference of effects in this system.\n\nKnowing the state at \\\\(T\\\\) following interventions and transformations, can we unequivocally deduce the precise nature and sequence of transformations and interventions applied throughout?",
  "Explanation": "Due to possible overlapping effects of the linear transformations and the general properties of complex functions influencing each other, distinguishing between effects solely based on the final state at \\\\(T\\\\) becomes non-trivial and ambiguous.",
