  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where C is a real constant representing frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) is studied over the interval \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nConsidering the complex function trajectory \\\\( z(T) \\\\) obtained at time T, is it possible to accurately trace back to determine whether the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various initial conditions and transformations due to the nature of exponential transformations involving complex numbers and their integral, creating ambiguity in uniquely determining the historical application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
