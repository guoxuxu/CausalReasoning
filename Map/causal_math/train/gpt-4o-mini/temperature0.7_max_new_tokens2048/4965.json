  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\), where \\\\( W \\\\) is a complex constant, we consider the impact of the transformation map \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) where \\\\( J \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{J0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) (which is unchanged at t = 0), but the behavior for t > 0 will evolve differently due to the differential equation with the modified initial condition, affected by both \\\\( W \\\\) and \\\\( J \\\\), leading to potentially different trajectories.",
