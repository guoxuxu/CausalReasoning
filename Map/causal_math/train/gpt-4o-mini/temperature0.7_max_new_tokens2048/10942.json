  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation via a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\\\). Let's examine the effects of modifying the function in the frequency domain and then applying the inverse transformation to recover the signal in the time domain.\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation \\\\( g(w) \\\\) after the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in the time domain without any error?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the transformations were done correctly and all properties required for the Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms are satisfied, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) can be precisely recovered from \\\\( g(w) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transformation.",
