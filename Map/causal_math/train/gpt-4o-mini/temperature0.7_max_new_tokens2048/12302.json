  "Problem": "In a control system analysis, the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) acts on a state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. We explore the changes in state space when applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) at different points in time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be conditionally influenced only by D and not by C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation influencing the trajectory of the system. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by both the earlier application of \\\\( e^{tC} \\\\) and the scaling impact of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), rendering the endpoint dependent on both C and D.",
