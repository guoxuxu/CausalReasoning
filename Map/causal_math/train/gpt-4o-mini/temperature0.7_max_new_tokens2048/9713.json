  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), with \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) a fixed complex constant. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) modifies the scaling of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by a factor of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha T} \\\\). Thus, the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is fundamentally different as the magnification changes the trajectory compared to the base differential equation.",
