  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real variable. We explore the impact of the Laplace transform on this function, given by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a fixed \\\\( a \\\\), and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time without further intervention, does the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) depend solely on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) directly depends on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\), given by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) (assuming \\\\( s > \\\\operatorname{Re}(a) \\\\)). Hence, the transformation results depend entirely on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) with no dependency on initial conditions or external inputs apart from \\\\( a \\\\).",
