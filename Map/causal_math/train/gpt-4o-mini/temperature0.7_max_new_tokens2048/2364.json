  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a time-dependent state in a system. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\( T[z] \\), \\( S[z] \\), or both) at time \\( t_1 \\) solely based on the endpoint \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) may result from various sequences or combinations of transformations. Given the superposition principle in linear systems and the possibility of complex interactions between the phase transformations \\( T[z] \\) and \\( S[z] \\), it is impossible to uniquely identify the nature or sequence of transformations from the endpoint alone.",
