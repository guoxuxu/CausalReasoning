  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We consider the impact of an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\) applied to \\( z \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a real constant.\n\nKnowing the integral transformation result \\( T(z) \\) at t = T, can one precisely infer the initial value \\( z_0 \\) without information on whether any modification to \\( z(t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\( T(z) \\) provides integrated information over time and contains components due to both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\alpha \\), making it difficult to extract \\( z_0 \\) directly without additional details about the function's evolution or transformations applied.",
