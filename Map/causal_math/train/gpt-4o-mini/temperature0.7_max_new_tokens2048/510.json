  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = c e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), transforming it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from its Fourier transform if the presence of a pre-transform phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from its Fourier transform as multiple functions differing by a phase shift can have identical magnitudes in their frequency domain representations.",
