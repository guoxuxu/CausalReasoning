  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time evolving according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) as real constants. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-st}z(\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting at t = 0 and left to evolve under the described differential equation, will \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T be influenced directly by changes in \\\\( k \\\\) while holding \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) constant?",
  "Explanation": "The parameter \\\\( k \\\\) influences the growth rate and behavior of the real part of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting both the amplitude and the integral's value over time. Changing \\\\( k \\\\) while maintaining \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) will modify the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and consequently the calculated value of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\).",
