  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants. We investigate how the application of an input signal function transformed by \\\\( g(t) = e^{dt} \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) impacts the output over time.\n\nIf an input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( g(t) = e^{dt}x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then processed through the circuit described by \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was directly processed without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies the input signal by scaling it exponentially, which changes the frequency content of the signal. This altered input, when processed by the circuit, results in a different output compared to the unmodified input due to the frequency-dependent nature of the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
