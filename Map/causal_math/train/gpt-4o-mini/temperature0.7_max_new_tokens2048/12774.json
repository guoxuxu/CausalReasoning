  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax + B} \\\\) with matrices A and B. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) to analyze its properties in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an additional linear transformation represented by matrix C is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) prior to the Fourier transformation, will the resulting transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) be independent of B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new matrix C creates additional interactions with matrices A and B when being transformed. The resultant Fourier transform will be affected not only by C but also by the original terms A and B, displaying combined effects in the frequency spectrum.",
