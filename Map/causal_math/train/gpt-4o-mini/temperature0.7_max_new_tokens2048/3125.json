  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain z as \\\\( f(z) = c^z \\\\) for a constant c. Analyze how the Laplace transform impacts this function when converted using an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is transformed into the Laplace domain without any modifications, does the Laplace transform, represented as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), uniquely correspond to the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) involves an integral transformation that encapsulates all values over an infinite range, potentially losing information about the individual behavior at specific points, thus not uniquely representing the original function.",
