  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) each satisfy the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y \\\\) with different parameters \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\). We explore using a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its impact on interpreting frequency components.\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha > 0 \\\\), is applied at time zero to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\) still be recognizable in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) after transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but does not eliminate the characteristic frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\). Instead, the Fourier transform will show broadened peaks (not delta functions anymore) centered at these frequencies. The damping introduces exponential decay, affecting the sharpness but not the location of the frequency peaks.",
