  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(0, x)]\\\\) is applied to the initial condition at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t,x)]\\\\) at t = T be determined solely by the evolution under \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial conditions provides the initial frequency domain representation. The linear character of both the differential equation and the Fourier transform ensures that the evolution in the transformed domain is still dictated by the initial equation, applying the shift property of the Fourier transform which directly corresponds to the equation's characteristics.",
