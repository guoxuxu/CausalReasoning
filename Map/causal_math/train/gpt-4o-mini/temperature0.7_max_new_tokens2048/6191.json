  "Problem": "Consider the analytical solution of the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) under initial conditions that can be represented as a Fourier transform. An operation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf an additional perturbation represented by \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{-i\\\\alpha x} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant frequency) is introduced as an intervention at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial perturbation and not on the nature of \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) adds another independent sinusoidal perturbation to the evolving solution. The final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) depends not only on the original perturbation \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) from \\\\( f(u) \\\\) but also on the new perturbation \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Each sinusoidal component will evolve under the heat equation, affecting the overall temperature distribution at any given time thereafter.",
