  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T be influenced by the matrix \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(X) \\\\) at the initial time alters the starting point of the system with the effect of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{CT} \\\\). This modified initial condition affects how the solution evolves under the stochastic differential equation, hence the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) will reflect the influence of both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",
