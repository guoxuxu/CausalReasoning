  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is an operator. We examine the behavior under the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the resulting function is left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > 0 be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under the same operator?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation that alters only how we represent the function, not its intrinsic properties under the linear operator L. Thus, the evolution under \\\\( L \\\\) gives equivalent results in the frequency domain and the time domain.",
