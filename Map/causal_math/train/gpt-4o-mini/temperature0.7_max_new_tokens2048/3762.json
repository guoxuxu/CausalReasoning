  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior under the transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant, analyzing the time evolution represented by this transformation.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to conclusively infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can correspond to multiple initial conditions due to the ambiguity created by the exponential growth or shrinkage in magnitude introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) at t = 0. The phase evolution alone cannot determine the exact initial state's magnitude.",
