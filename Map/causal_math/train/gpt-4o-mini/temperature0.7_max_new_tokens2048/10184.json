  "Problem": "Consider the impact of different transform kernels in an integral transformation on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Define transform kernels \\\\( K(t, x) = e^{At} \\\\) and intervention kernels \\\\( L(t, x) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, on the analysis of the function over time.\n\nGiven the function at t = T, can we determine exactly what kernels were applied (whether \\\\( K \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing the function at that time?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influences of the multiple kernels can result in similar transformations of the original function, making it impossible to precisely disentangle and identify from the end state which kernels were applied.",
