  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\( z(t) \\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\) applied to this system, where \\( k \\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we accurately determine the specific interventions applied (neither, either \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) by knowing \\( z(T) \\) and assuming initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The complex interactions between \\( i \\omega \\), \\( k \\), and \\( c \\) mean that identical states \\( z(T) \\) could result from different combinations of interventions and parameters. The trajectory of \\( z(T) \\) does not uniquely determine which transformations and parameters were utilized.",
