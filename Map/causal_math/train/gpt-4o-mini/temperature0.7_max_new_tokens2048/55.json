  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\\\) and its impact on a contour integral over a closed path in the complex plane. Analyze how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z + ai\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit) affects the evaluation of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) around a simple closed contour \\\\(C\\\\).\n\nAfter applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\) on \\\\(C\\\\) to get \\\\(C'\\\\), if another transformation \\\\(h(z) = z - bi\\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is a constant) is applied to get \\\\(C''\\\\), will the new integral \\\\(\\\\oint_{C''} f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) depend solely on transformations and not on the nature of \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral \\\\(\\\\oint_{C''} f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\) still depends critically on both the nature of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and how its poles are positioned relative to the new contour \\\\(C''\\\\). The transformations can change the location and topology of the contour, but the value of the integral is heavily influenced by where the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) has singularities within \\\\(C''\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(z) affects the evaluation of the integral ∮_C f(z) dz by mapping the contour C to C', and the subsequent transformation h(z) further modifies the contour from C' to C''. The integral ∮_{C''} f(z) dz is influenced by both transformations g and h, indicating that the integral's evaluation depends on the transformations applied rather than solely on the nature of f(z).",
