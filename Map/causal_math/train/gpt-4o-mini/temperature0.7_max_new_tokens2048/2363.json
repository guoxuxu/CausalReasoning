  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a time-dependent state in a system. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( S[z](t) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) (where \\( -\\omega \\) is the complex conjugate frequency) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend exclusively on the parameter \\( \\omega \\) and not on the nature of the previous transformations \\( S \\) or \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( S[z](t) \\) introduces a new transformation with possibly opposing effects due to the inverse frequency, affecting the evolving state of \\( z(t) \\). Therefore, the final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on both the impact of \\( T[z] \\) and \\( S[z] \\) as well as the frequency \\( \\omega \\), making the trajectory dependent on multiple factors.",
