  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. The function describes a circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) on this periodic function.\n\nKnowing the form of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i\\omega} \\\\), can we definitely say that a damping intervention was applied to an originally simple harmonic function in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the term \\\\( +\\alpha \\\\) in the denominator of the Laplace transform, where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\), clearly indicates an exponential damping factor was introduced to a simple harmonic function, affecting its amplitude over time.",
