  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution along a rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial heat distribution function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and a later heat source intervention represented by \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\).\n\nCan the initial heat distribution \\\\(h(x)\\\\) be uniquely determined from the temperature distribution observed at time T, \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), assuming no intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the exact initial heat distribution \\\\(h(x)\\\\) from a later distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) is generally an ill-posed problem. The diffusion process governed by the heat equation causes dispersal and equalization of temperature, which often results in loss of information about specific initial conditions.",
