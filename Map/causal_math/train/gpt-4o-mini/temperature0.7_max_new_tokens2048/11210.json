  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. Over time, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( T \\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely recovered without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied to the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) involves integration that obscures the specific attributes of the starting complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), since multiple initial values could lead to similar transformation outputs depending on their integration and exponential interaction over time.",
