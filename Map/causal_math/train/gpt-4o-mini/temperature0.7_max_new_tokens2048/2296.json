  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. This scenario explores how the Laplace transform impacts the behavior of the function over time.\n\nGiven the final form of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) from a transformed function involving multiple exponential interventions (e.g., \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and later \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\)), can we conclusively identify the exact interventions (values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)) solely based on the outcome \\\\( z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the scenario where \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} + \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\), each term associated with the respective interventions distinctly reflects the specific exponents \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used. Knowing the form of the transform, the separate contributions and values can be conclusively determined from the poles of each term.",
