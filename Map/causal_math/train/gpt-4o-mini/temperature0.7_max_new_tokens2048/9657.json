  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\), where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a complex function. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\lambda s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(T) \\\\) directly evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by integrating the exponential function with \\\\( z(s) \\\\). This integration alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), influencing its evolution differently than if it were merely subject to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\). This is due to the non-linear impacts introduced by the integral transform.",
