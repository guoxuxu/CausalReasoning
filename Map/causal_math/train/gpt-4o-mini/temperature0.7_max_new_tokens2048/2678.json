  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} + Bz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant complex numbers and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The situation investigates the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f(z)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over a period T.\n\nFrom observing the outcome of \\\\( T[f(z)] \\\\), can we uniquely determine the values of A and B used in the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without prior information on s?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific value of s, it's challenging to dissect the contributions of \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) and \\\\( Bz \\\\) from the integral because the decay rate \\\\( e^{-sz} \\\\) significantly modulates the presence of both terms in the result, thereby obscuring their individual effects.",
