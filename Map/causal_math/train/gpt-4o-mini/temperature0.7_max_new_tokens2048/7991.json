  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which represents a unit circle in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer, on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying another function \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) at time t_1 is made, will this affect the fundamental nature of the trajectory as a circle in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "This subsequent transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\), applied after an initial \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), results in \\\\( z(t) = (e^{int})^m = e^{imnt} \\\\) for t > t_1. While this changes the frequency by multiplying the original frequency by m, the inherent geometric nature as a unit circle remains unchanged. Thus, the trajectory remains a circle, though its frequency of traversal changes again.",
