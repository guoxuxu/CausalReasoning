  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a set of functions defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) represents a rotation by A in the complex plane over time t. Additionally, let there be a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the trajectory depending on the values of C and its relation to A and B. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, and C, influenced by their respective rotational contributions and timing interactions.",
