  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system expressed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then subjected to a Laplace Transform, transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{C}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) follows its defined function over time without any external manipulation, will the Laplace Transform always yield \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{C}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) irrespective of the initial phase of the function?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the exponential function will consistently result in \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{C}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), regardless of the initial phase conditions, as the transform specifically depends on the constants \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and their relationship to \\\\( s \\\\), without any dependency on initial phase or other parameters.",
