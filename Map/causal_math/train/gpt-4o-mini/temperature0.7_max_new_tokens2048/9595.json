  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-dependent signal in the complex plane where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This scenario analyzes the impact of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), applied to this function and its influence over frequency domain representation.\n\nIf an intervention involves modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by multiplying with another exponential signal \\\\( e^{i\\sigma t} \\\\) at time T, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) only show a frequency shift by \\\\( \\sigma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) by another exponential signal shifts its frequency by \\\\( \\sigma \\\\). The Fourier Transform of the modified signal, therefore, becomes centered at \\\\( \\omega + \\sigma \\\\), indicating a direct frequency shift, without affecting other frequency components.",
