  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix. The transformation of this function under a Laplace transform is investigated.\n\nIf a matrix B modifies the complex function to \\\\( f(z) = e^{(A+B)z} \\\\), and a Laplace transform is applied, does the result solely depend on A?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation via matrix B changes the function to \\\\( e^{(A+B)z} \\\\). Thus, the Laplace transform now depends on the new matrix \\\\( A + B \\\\), resulting in \\\\( (sI - (A + B))^{-1} \\\\). This outcome is influenced by both A and B.",
