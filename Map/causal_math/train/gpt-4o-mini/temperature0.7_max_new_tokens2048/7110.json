  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) each satisfy the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y \\\\) with different parameters \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\). We explore using a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its impact on interpreting frequency components.\n\nGiven a Fourier transformed output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\), can it be deduced that the original time-domain signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) contained components with precise frequencies of \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, if the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) shows distinct peaks at certain frequencies, this provides a clear indication of the presence of components in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) oscillating at these frequencies. The nature of the linear differential equation guarantees that each component contributes a delta function at its natural frequency in the Fourier domain.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The functions u(t) and v(t) each contribute to the complex function z(t). The function u(t) is determined by the differential equation that depends on the parameter omega_u, while v(t) is determined by a different differential equation that depends on omega_v. The Fourier transform of the complex function z(t) results in Z(ω), which reveals the frequency components of the original time-domain signal z(t).",
