  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time T, can we infer the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without any knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform obscures temporal details due to its integral nature over all time; specific information about the initial state at t = 0 cannot be accurately reconstructed without additional information about the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or other contextual factors.",
