  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = iAz \\\\), where A is a constant real number that dictates the rate of rotation in the complex plane. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{-At}z \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(z) = e^{-Bt}z\\\\) (where B is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\(g(z)\\\\) fundamentally changes the trajectory by imposing a new phase shift (rotation in the opposite direction) based on B. The final state at \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will not just depend on the original system's parameter A but will also be significantly influenced by B, the parameter dictating the rate of the new transformation.",
