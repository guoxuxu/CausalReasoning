  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\). We study the effect of transformations \\\\( g(x, y) = (x + 1, y + 1) \\\\) and their inverse on the function, along with an external forcive change in variable using the transformation \\\\( h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) is applied at the initial point \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) and allowed to evolve by \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) at this new point differ from its value at \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x, y) = (x + 1, y + 1) \\\\) changes the input values to the function, and thus the result of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) will differ. The new value of \\\\( f \\\\) will be \\\\( (x_0 + 1)^2 + 2(x_0 + 1)(y_0 + 1) + (y_0 + 1)^2 \\\\), which, except in special cases, won't equal \\\\( f(x_0, y_0) = x_0^2 + 2x_0y_0 + y_0^2 \\\\).",
