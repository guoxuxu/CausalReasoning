  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a transformation via a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) on a complex plane where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. Consider the system's change over time if it is described by the flow \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we uniquely ascertain what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(w) \\\\), \\\\( h(w) \\\\), or both) based solely on the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific transformations from the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is ambiguous due to the potential for different combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) to yield the same result, especially given the nature of complex exponentials and their effects on the phase and magnitude of \\\\( w \\\\). This overlap in effects means that multiple operational sequences can lead to the same endpoint.",
