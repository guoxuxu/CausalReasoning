  "Problem": "Consider a system where stock prices are modeled by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW)\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\) representing the drift and volatility parameters, respectively. We further consider the impact of an economic policy intervention which can be modeled by an exponential adjustment factor \\\\(f(S) = e^{\\\\alpha t}S\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the stock starts at a price \\\\(S_0\\\\) and is left to evolve according to the given stochastic differential equation without any economic interventions, will the stock price at time \\\\(T\\\\) be the same as if it started at \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha T}S_0\\\\) and evolved under the same conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The stock price at time \\\\(T\\\\) starting from \\\\(S_0\\\\) will follow a path determined by the initial condition \\\\(S_0\\\\), unaffected by the transformation \\\\(f(S)\\\\). The stock evolving from \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha T}S_0\\\\) would have a different initial price due to the exponential factor, leading to a different distribution of potential final prices.",
