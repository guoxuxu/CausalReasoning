  "Problem": "Suppose there is a function \\\\(z(x, t)\\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + x \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) where x represents space and t represents time. An intervention \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is defined as \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x, t) + v(x, t)\\\\), with \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) being solutions to another set of PDEs.\n\nGiven the function \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we uniquely identify the initial conditions \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, 0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The combination of initial conditions leading to a specific \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) is not unique without additional information on the separate functions \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\), especially if they are not linearly independent or integrated differently across spatial variables.",
