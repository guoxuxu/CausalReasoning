  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) x(t) \\\\). The signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nIf at a specific moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\eta t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final result \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the initial linear equation settings, disregarding the effects of transformations \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) adds a new layer of complexity to the signal's evolution, making the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) a result of not only the linear operator L but also influenced by the effects of both transformations (\\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)). These transformations affect how the signal evolves, leading to a final state that cannot be predicted solely from the initial linear configuration.",
