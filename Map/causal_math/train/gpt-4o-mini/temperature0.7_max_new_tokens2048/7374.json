  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The transformation specified by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to study the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nBy examining the vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt} \\\\) may have radically changed the initial state. The effect of N on the evolution path is critical, and without this information, the inverse transformation cannot be precisely determined.",
