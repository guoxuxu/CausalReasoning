  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function over time domain t.\n\nGiven the transformed function in the s-domain post both the Laplace transform and the shifting intervention, can we uniquely determine the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the shift \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the transformed function, now at \\\\( s = a + i\\\\omega \\\\), allows us to uniquely determine both the shift \\\\( a \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by decomposing the real and imaginary parts of the pole.",
