  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the system \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t)\\\\), with P being a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(z) = Qz \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Pz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be identical to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Pz\\\\) to T without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Qz \\\\) at the outset modifies the initial conditions. Depending on the nature of Q relative to P, this can change the trajectory in the complex plane, resulting in a different state at time T.",
