  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar frequency. Analyze the behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention changes the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace transform still be representable as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency change intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards. The final Laplace transform will be affected by both segments of the function pre- and post-intervention, leading to a form that cannot purely be represented by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\).",
