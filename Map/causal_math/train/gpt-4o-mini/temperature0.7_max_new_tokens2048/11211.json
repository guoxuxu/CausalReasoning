  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. Over time, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( T \\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another linear operator \\\\( U(z) = z + c \\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting function at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be dependent only on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) or intervention \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( U(z) \\\\) affects the trajectory by adding a constant term \\\\( c \\\\), causing the endpoint to depend on the specifics of both the initial transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( U \\\\). The evolution becomes a result of the complex interactions among \\\\( \\omega \\\\), \\\\( T\\\\), and \\\\( U\\\\).",
