  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( y(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = My + Nu \\), with \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) as constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) as the control input. An operator \\( T(y) = e^{Ky} \\) is introduced, where \\( K \\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( T(y) \\) is initially applied and at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a control \\( u(t) \\) is modified, will the resulting \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) solely depend on \\( M \\) and not \\( K \\) or \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of \\( y(t) \\) will be influenced by the initial application of \\( T(y) \\) and any modifications in \\( u(t) \\), which affects \\( y(t) \\) through \\( N \\). Both \\( N \\) and \\( K \\) influence the system’s response alongside \\( M \\), affecting \\( y(T) \\) in a compositional manner.",
