  "Problem": "Consider a vibrational system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\zeta \\\\) is the damping ratio and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the natural frequency. We study the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) = (e^{At}x, e^{At}\\\\dot{x}) \\\\), where A is a scalar.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( (x_0, \\\\dot{x}_0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( (x(t), \\\\dot{x}(t)) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( (x_0, \\\\dot{x}_0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\) modifies both the position and velocity by a factor of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), changing the initial condition of the system. This deviation impacts how the system evolves over time under the influence of damping and restoring forces, leading to a different state at t = T.",
