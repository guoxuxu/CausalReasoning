  "Problem": "Consider the mathematical system where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real number, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) without any further manipulation, will the resulting transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be localized at \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) is indeed a delta function centered at \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( F(z) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - A) \\\\) due to the properties of the Fourier transform of exponential oscillatory functions. This precisely aligns the frequency component with \\\\( A \\\\), showcasing direct correspondence.",
