  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolved according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) at any s match the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a function that evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) will remain consistent regardless of when the transform is applied due to the linearity and time-invariance of the transformation and the differential equation.",
