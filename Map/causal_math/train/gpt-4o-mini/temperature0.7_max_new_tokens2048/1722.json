  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) is a function of space and time. An integral transformation particularly the Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\) is considered to observe the behavior of the system in the frequency domain over time.\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) without knowing if any transformations or initial conditions were modified before time evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the Fourier transform is linear and invertible under ideal conditions, practical limitations such as loss of information, non-linearity of real-world systems, or unknown initial modifications prevent us from exactly determining \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) based solely on \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\).",
