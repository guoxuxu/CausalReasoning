  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nCan we precisely identify the nature of the intervention \\( Q(D) \\) applied at \\( t_1 \\) by analyzing \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at \\( T \\), knowing only the initial operator \\( P(D) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple potential interventions \\( Q(D) \\) could lead to equivalent modifications in \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\), especially if \\( P(D) \\) and \\( Q(D) \\) are not uniquely distinguishable in their effect on the frequency spectrum. Without additional information, it is impossible to unambiguously determine which \\( Q(D) \\) was applied.",
