  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) in a complex domain, defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\). The causal inference involves analyzing transformations through the function and the reverse mapping from the function back to its inputs.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( y \\\\) by a scaling factor \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), and the system is subsequently allowed to evolve under \\\\( f(x, \\lambda y) \\\\), will the output be solely determined by the original variable \\\\( x \\\\) and the scaling factor \\\\( \\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Though the transformation of \\\\( y \\\\) to \\\\( \\lambda y \\\\) alters \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\), the dependence on \\\\( y \\\\) remains. The system’s output depends complexly on both \\\\( x \\\\) and the new value \\\\( \\lambda y \\\\), indicating a dependency on both the original input and the intervention’s magnitude.",
