  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), which is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. The effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If it is unknown whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, one cannot definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the effect of Q might have re-scaled or rotated z in a way that is indistinguishable from the effects induced by P alone at later times.",
