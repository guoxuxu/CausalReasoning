  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an additional functional transformation \\\\( g(x) = Ux \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is a unitary matrix, on the eigenvalues of the vector \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) without further intervention, will the eigenvalues of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( U \\\\) is a unitary matrix, it preserves the eigenvalues of \\\\( x \\\\). Thus, the transformed vector still evolves with the same eigenvalues under \\\\( T \\\\), given that matrix multiplication is associative and \\\\( U \\\\) does not change eigenvalues.",
