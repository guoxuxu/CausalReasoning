  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{j\\omega t} x(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) is a time-dependent input signal and \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. The dynamics of \\( x(t) \\) in the system are described by a complex function \\( x(t+1) = L x(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear transformation.\n\nCan we deduce the initial signal \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether the transformation \\( z(t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial phase modulation \\( e^{j\\omega t} \\), we cannot accurately trace back to the original signal \\( x_0 \\) from \\( z(T) \\). The modulation may have altered significant characteristics of the signal, such as phase, which are critical to reconstructing \\( x_0 \\).",
