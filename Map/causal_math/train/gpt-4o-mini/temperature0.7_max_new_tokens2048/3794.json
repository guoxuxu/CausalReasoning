  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation using the matrix \\\\( L \\\\), which operates in the complex function space by multiplying with the matrix \\\\( e^{i\\omega} \\\\), an operator associated with frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\. The system is analyzed for function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\) solely based on the function observed at some \\\\( z = Z \\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "Given the function at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) post-transformation, and without information about \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\), there are countless possible combinations of \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) that could yield the observed output. This uncertainty arises because the initial form and the transformation's frequency heavily influence the resulting function.",
