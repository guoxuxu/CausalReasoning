  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) where L is a linear operator on a function space, and the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Analyze how the system behaves under the Fourier transform and its inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be determined after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), the alterations made in the frequency domain can obscure the original characteristics of \\\\( x_0 \\\\). Changes induced by L in the transformed domain may not be directly invertible to retrieve \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
