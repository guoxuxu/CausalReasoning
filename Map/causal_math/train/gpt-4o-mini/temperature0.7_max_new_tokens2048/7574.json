  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), with P being a constant complex number. Consider the Beta transformation defined as \\\\( h(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an ambiguity in retracing the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the multiplication by \\\\( e^{QT} \\\\) can significantly alter the initial condition in such a way that it becomes non-recoverable simply by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The constant complex number P governs the rate of change of z(t) over time, while the function z(t) is influenced by its real components u(t) and v(t). The transformation h(z) modifies the state of z(t) through multiplication by e^{Qt}, but does not change the underlying properties of z(t) itself. Observing z(T) provides information about the state at time T, but does not allow for the exact determination of the original state z(0) without knowing if the transformation h(z) was applied.",
