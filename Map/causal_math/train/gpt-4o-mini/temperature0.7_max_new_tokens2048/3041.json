  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T remain purely dependent on the evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), unaffected by \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\). The evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\) from this modified initial condition results in \\\\( z(T) = e^{kT}e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\), which differs by a complex phase factor e^{i\\\\theta} from the direct evolution \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends significantly on the initial transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
