  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output is described as \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of input variables, and \\\\( H \\\\) is a transformation matrix. The evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. We analyze how the impulse response defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix) affects the system over time.\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can one deduce the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about the initial application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduces uncertainty in tracing back to the original input state \\\\( x_0 \\\\). This uncertainty stems from not knowing how \\\\( D \\\\) has potentially modified the trajectory of \\\\( x \\\\), impacting the resultant \\\\( z \\\\).",
