  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are square matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors. The function describes the evolution of two components combined linearly over time and affected by different transformation matrices.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a linear operator \\\\( C \\\\) is applied to the system so that the new state becomes \\\\( z(t_1) = C (e^{At_1}x + e^{Bt_1}y) \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) remain dependent on the initial matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the intervention with \\\\( C \\\\), the following evolution of the system from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) still builds upon the transitional forms \\\\( e^{A(t-T)} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{B(t-T)} \\\\), which implicates that the effect at \\\\( T \\\\) is influenced by the behaviors of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) from the initial state, modified through the transformation by \\\\( C \\\\).",
