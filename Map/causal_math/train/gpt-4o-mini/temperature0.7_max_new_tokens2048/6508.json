  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}(t-s)X(s) ds\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and X(s) is a time-dependent input function. We explore the impact of modifying the input via the transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Bt}X(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(X) \\\\), \\\\( h(X) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied (\\\\( g(X) \\\\) or \\\\( h(X) \\\\) or both) from the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the overlapping effects of the exponential functions modulating the input. The transformations could yield similar end states due to their non-commutative nature and the integral interaction, making it impossible to uniquely back-infer the exact interventions.",
