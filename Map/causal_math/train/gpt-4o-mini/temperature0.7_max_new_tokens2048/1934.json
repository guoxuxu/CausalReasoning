  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system where the stock price follows a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is the drift rate, \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) the volatility, and \\\\( dW \\\\) a Brownian motion increment. We apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(f) \\\\) to transform the probability density function of the stock price.\n\nCan we deduce the original probability density function at t = 0 directly from the characteristic function at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge that a Fourier transform was applied, reconstructing the original probability density from its characteristic function involves assumptions about initial transformations and conditions. Uncertainty about whether the transform was applied complicates direct inversion to retrieve the original form.",
