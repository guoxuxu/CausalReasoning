  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant. The function describes a point moving in a complex plane. We explore the relationship between linear transformations given by matrices and their effects on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nBy observing the wave pattern of \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) through time T, can we conclusively determine the transformation matrix A used at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "The observed pattern at \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) could be the result of different transformations that all yield visually or functionally similar wave patterns due to the complex exponential nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\\\), making it challenging to uniquely identify A without additional information.",
