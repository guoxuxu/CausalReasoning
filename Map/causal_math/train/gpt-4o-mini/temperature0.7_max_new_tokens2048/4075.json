  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. An integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to study its properties over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf an intervention \\( P(z) = z + c \\), where \\( c \\) is a complex constant, is introduced at time \\( t_1 \\), will \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) still only be determined by \\( \\omega \\) and not influenced by \\( c \\) or \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( P(z) \\) shifts \\( z \\) by a constant \\( c \\), altering the initial condition for the subsequent evolution. This modified initial condition changes the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\), making the final state \\( z(T) \\) dependent on \\( c \\) as well as \\( \\omega \\), and is independent of \\( T(z) \\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex-valued function z(t) influences its derivative, and the derivative influences the function itself. The function z(t) leads to the transformation T(z), which in turn affects the later state z(T). The intervention P(z) at time t1 modifies z(t1), which then influences z(T). The angular frequency ω affects z(T), indicating that it is a determinant of the function's behavior over time.",
