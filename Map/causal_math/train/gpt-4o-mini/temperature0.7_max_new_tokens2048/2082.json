  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. We are interested in observing how an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\) affects this function over time t.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at t = T, can we perfectly reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t in [0, T] without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) loses information about the phase of the original exponential function, providing only accumulated magnitude data. As a result, reconstructing the precise oscillatory nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) is impossible.",
