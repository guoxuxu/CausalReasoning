  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a complex exponential function. This function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is mapped through a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer. We explore the dynamics of this transformation over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nBased on the state observed at time \\\\( T \\\\) in a system where both \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) and an unknown transformation \\\\( g \\\\) could have been applied, can we precisely determine what transformation \\\\( g \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint state could potentially result from a variety of transformations due to the properties of powers in exponential functions, which might produce similar outcomes for different values of \\\\( m \\\\) in transformations like \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\). Thus, it's not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( g \\\\) based solely on the state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
