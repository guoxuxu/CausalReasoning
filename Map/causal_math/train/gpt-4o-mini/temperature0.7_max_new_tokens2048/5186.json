  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the function under the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately determine the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, not knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The uncertainty about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which is the transformation \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) on the initial state, complicates reversing the evolution accurately to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). If Q and P do not commute, it's particularly challenging to disconnect the effects and retrace back to the exact \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
