  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of an initial condition transformation described by \\\\( g(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{kt}\\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform and k is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial transformation, reversing the effects of both the differential operator and the potential frequency scaling due to \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) is ambiguous. This is particularly true if the operator \\\\( L \\\\) affects different frequency components in different ways.",
