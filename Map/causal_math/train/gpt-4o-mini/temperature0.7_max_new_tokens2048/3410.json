  "Problem": "Analyze the causal inference of a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = U(t)z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is a unitary operator in the complex plane and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system is disturbed by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{A\\tau}z \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant real-valued matrix and \\\\( \\tau \\\\) is time of application.\n\nObserving the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The possible application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduces an ambiguity since both \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and from some transformed state \\\\( z' = e^{A\\tau}z_0 \\\\) can converge to similar or the same locations on the complex plane without the ability to distinguish which path was taken due to the properties of exponential functions and unitary evolution.",
