  "Problem": "Consider a vibrating mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) in terms of time \\( t \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0 \\), where \\( \\zeta \\) is the damping ratio and \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the natural frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform and its inverse under different scenarios.\n\nIf we are given the Laplace Transform \\( X(s) \\) of the system's response, can we always uniquely determine the parameters \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\) of the original system?",
  "Explanation": "While \\( X(s) \\) provides significant information about the system's characteristics, multiple combinations of \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\) can result in similar transformed expressions especially if only a limited range of \\( s \\) is considered or if additional constraints (e.g., non-minimum phase systems) are not known.",
