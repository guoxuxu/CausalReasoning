  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a continuous time span from 0 to T, will the transformed function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at T be equivalent to a direct integral of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) includes an exponential factor \\\\( e^{St} \\\\) which modifies each instant of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before integration. It therefore alters the outcome of the integration compared to the integral of the unmodified function \\\\( z(t) \\\\. The presence of S distinctly impacts the resultant of the integral.",
