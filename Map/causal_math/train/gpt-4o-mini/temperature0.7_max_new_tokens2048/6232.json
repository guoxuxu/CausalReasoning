  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal x(t) is subjected to a linear transformation using an operator L. The transformed signal is represented as y(t) = L{x(t)}. Further, an integral transform T defined by T{y(t)} = ∫y(t)e^{-st} dt is applied to y(t).\n\nCan the original signal x(t) be uniquely determined from the outcome of T{z(t)} when knowing only that transformations L and M were applied at some stages before T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining x(t) solely from T{z(t)} without detailed information about the specific actions of L and M is challenging. The transformations could be non-invertible or not uniquely invertible, and different (L, M) pairs might yield the same outcome, obscuring the details of x(t).",
