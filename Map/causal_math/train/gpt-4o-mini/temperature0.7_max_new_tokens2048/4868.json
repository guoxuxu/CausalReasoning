  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform output, can we determine specifically which rotations (either \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-i\\\\phi} \\\\), or both) were applied to the initial complex number?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant Fourier transform output could potentially be a consequence of different combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) owing to the rotational symmetry. Different sets of rotations might result in the same final transformed output, rendering it ambiguous to infer the exact sequence or type of rotations applied without more detailed information.",
