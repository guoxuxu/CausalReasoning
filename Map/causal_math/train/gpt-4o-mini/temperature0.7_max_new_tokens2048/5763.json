  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We investigate the effect of the inverse transformation given by multiplying the transform by \\\\( s^2 \\\\) and then applying the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nIf an intermediate transformation induces a shift by \\\\( b \\\\) in the s-domain before applying the \\\\( s^2 \\\\) multiplication and inverse transformation, will the final time-domain function still reveal information about the original constant \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even after the shift by \\\\( b \\\\) and subsequent transformation, the source information about \\\\( a \\\\) remains encoded in the exponentials and overall formula structure. The final function will involve terms that reflect the influence of both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), albeit in a more complex relationship.",
