  "Problem": "Assume a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform on this function over the variable t.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function at s = a, can we deduce with certainty the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From the form of the Laplace transform, which is \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), the pole at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\) directly gives the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original exponential function. No additional information is required to infer \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
