  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) showing a distinct peak at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\), can we specifically determine whether the intervention involved adding a harmonic component, scalar multiplication, or both, based solely on \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a peak at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\) in the Fourier transform could imply an added harmonic component. However, without knowing the original and transitional states of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it's impossible to definitively establish whether a scalar modification, addition of a harmonic, or both occurred, as the scalar factor could also affect the amplitude of all frequency components.",
