  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional space where a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y)) \\\\) influences particle trajectories. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation defined by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), which rotates vectors by a fixed angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the altered trajectory of a particle, can we determine if the vector field was initially transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), the transformation angle of \\\\( L \\\\), it's not possible to definitely ascertain the initial application of \\\\( L \\\\) as multiple angles could result in similar altered trajectories depending on the original vector field configuration.",
