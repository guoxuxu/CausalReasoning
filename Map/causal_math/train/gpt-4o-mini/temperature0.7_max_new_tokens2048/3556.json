  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-s^2} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) represents an input function. We study the role of transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) on input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and observe its impact over the interval [0, a].\n\nFrom the outcome \\\\( y(a) \\\\), can we specify which interventions (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) occurred, solely based on the endpoint value?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could produce the same or similar values of \\\\( y(a) \\\\) due to the overlap in potential resulting integrals. The non-linear transformations and their effects complicate unequivocal identification of the interventions used.",
