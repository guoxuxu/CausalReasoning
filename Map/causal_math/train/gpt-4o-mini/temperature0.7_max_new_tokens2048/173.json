  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a linear time-invariant system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this system and its implications on system behavior.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( x(0) \\\\) is transformed via Fourier and then evolved according to \\\\( M \\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at any given time t be predictable by solely using M and \\\\( x(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition changes the representation of state from time domain to frequency domain, hence the subsequent system's behavior in time cannot be directly inferred using only M and the initial \\\\( x(0) \\\\) without considering the inverse Fourier transform and how M affects these transformed components.",
