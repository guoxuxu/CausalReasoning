  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex number. Analyze the mappings when transformed by this exponential function in the complex plane, considering different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function is modified at a particular point z by multiplying with another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) (where B is another complex number), will the resultant integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z)g(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) be solely influenced by A?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new dynamic into the path integral. The resultant function \\\\( f(z)g(z) = e^{(A+B)z} \\\\) shows dependency on both A and B, which means the outcome of the integral over C is influenced by both.",
