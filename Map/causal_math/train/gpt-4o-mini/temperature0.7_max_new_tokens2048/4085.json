  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) which is derived as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - A} \\\\), where A represents a constant. The system is studied under a Heaviside step function input \\\\( u(t) = 1(t) \\\\) converted into the Laplace domain to form \\\\( U(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\). The output in the Laplace domain is then \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the system runs with input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without any changes, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) always be determined solely by the parameters A in \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and system input?",
  "Explanation": "Since the input and the system's impulse response are defined clearly without changes, \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) which is the product of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( U(s) \\\\) will be determined by \\\\( A \\\\) and the input. The response is directly calculated from these given parameters without deviation.",
