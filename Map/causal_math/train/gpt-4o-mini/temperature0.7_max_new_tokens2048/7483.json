  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We also define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, applied to the function z over the time period t.\n\nWhen an intervention in the form of another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend independently on A and B, and not be influenced by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations first through \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and later \\\\( g(z) \\\\) affects the real and imaginary components of z. Hence, the final state at T will consider the effects of A, B, C, and D collectively. Compositional impacts of these matrices determine divergent trajectories for z in the complex plane.",
