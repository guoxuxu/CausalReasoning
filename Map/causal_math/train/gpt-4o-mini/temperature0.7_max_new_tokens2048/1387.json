  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)](s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) + i\\\\mathcal{L}[v(t)](s) \\\\). We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = az + b \\\\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where c and d are complex constants) is applied after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), before taking the Laplace Transform, will the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still exhibit effects from the first transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation modifies the already altered function, and both transformations leave their respective impacts on the transformed function. The final result depends on the composition of these transformations, reflecting both modifications.",
