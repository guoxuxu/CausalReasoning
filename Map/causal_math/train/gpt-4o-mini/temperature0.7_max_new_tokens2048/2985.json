  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) which converts function u(x, t) into its frequency components U(k, t).\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial condition and then evolving the frequency components under L does not change the physical system's properties or the linear operator's application. The inverse Fourier transform will recover the same state as evolving the original function directly.",
