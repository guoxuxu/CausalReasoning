  "Problem": "Examine a convolution integral system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} x(\\\\tau) h(t-\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response, a known function. Changes are made to the input signal via transformation \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\), with a being a constant.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can one determine if the input was \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\) without knowing the exact transformation applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied, and without additional data or constraints, it’s impossible to uniquely infer the form of the input only from the final output due to potential variations in initial adjustments by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\).",
