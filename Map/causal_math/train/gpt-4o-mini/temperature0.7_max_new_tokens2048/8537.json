  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) with kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\).\n\nIf the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), and then the PDE is solved without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be equivalent to solving the PDE with the original initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to the initial condition changes the input to the PDE. Since \\\\( T[u(x,0)] \\\\) typically alters the initial state, the evolution governed by \\\\( L \\\\) will produce a different solution compared to using \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) directly.",
