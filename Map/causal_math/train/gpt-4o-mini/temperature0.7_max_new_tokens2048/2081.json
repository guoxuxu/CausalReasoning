  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. We are interested in observing how an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\) affects this function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) is computed for the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without any additional operations or manipulations, will the resulting transformation be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) had not undergone the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) accumulates the effect of the complex exponential function over the interval [0, T], resulting in a new function different from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The operation fundamentally alters the output by integrating the oscillatory behavior of the exponential function.",
