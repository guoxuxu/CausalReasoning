  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Qx \\\\) at time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, and we analyze its impact over various conditions.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) alters the initial conditions of the system from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Qx_0 \\\\). Since the future state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) depends linearly on the initial conditions under the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), the state at time T, \\\\( e^{MT}Qx_0 \\\\), will differ from \\\\( e^{MT}x_0 \\\\) unless Q commutes with \\\\( e^{MT} \\\\) for system-specific reasons.",
