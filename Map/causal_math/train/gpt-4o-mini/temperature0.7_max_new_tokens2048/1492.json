  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The equation determines the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) as a function of time \\\\( t \\\\) on a unit circle in the complex plane. Analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the final point \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine conclusively which interventions were utilized (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), simply by observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be reached by different sequences of transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or just one of them, due to the periodic and overlapping effects of powers on the complex exponential function. The endpoint therefore does not uniquely specify the pathway of transformations applied because of these potential combinations.",
