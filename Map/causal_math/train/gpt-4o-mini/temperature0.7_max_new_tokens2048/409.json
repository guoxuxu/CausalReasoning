  "Problem": "We investigate a signal processing system characterized by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system governed by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = h(t) * x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system’s impulse response and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied to the signal defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) by a factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and allowed to process through the system without further intervention, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be affected by the modification after applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the input signal by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) alters the frequency components of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), affecting the Fourier transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Since the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the modified \\\\( x(t) \\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will consequently be different, illustrating a direct causal impact from the modification of the input signal.",
