  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by a partial differential equation represented as \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of both time and space variables, and \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Consider the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) on the system for initial conditions.\n\nGiven the system's state at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine whether any Fourier transformations were applied either initially or at an intermediate point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) only from the knowledge of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) does not carry explicit markers distinguishing whether Fourier transformations were applied at the beginning or midway. The linear nature of both the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) and the Fourier transformation means multiple initial and intermediate states could culminate in the same final state. The inability to reverse-engineer the exact sequence of transformations from the final observation stems from this non-uniqueness.",
