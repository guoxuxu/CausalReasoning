  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\). Let's introduce a complex transformation represented by \\\\( p(x) = e^{i \\\\theta}x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number. Analyze the behavior of a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) within this framework.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is applied to the result, without any further manipulation, will the final state of the vector be different from directly applying \\\\( p(h(x_0)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Because matrix multiplication and scalar multiplication are associative, applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) followed by \\\\( p(x) \\\\) results in the same outcome as the direct application of \\\\( p(h(x_0)) \\\\). Thus, the operations can be rearranged without changing the result.",
