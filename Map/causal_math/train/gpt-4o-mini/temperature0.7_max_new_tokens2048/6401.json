  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. Analyze the effect of applying a linear time-invariant system transformation characterized by the impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) for \\\\(t \\\\geq 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is applied to the voltage source \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the circuit is allowed to evolve under \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(V(t)\\\\) without transformation was directly applied under \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(t)\\\\) modifies the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) to a new function, changing how the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) evolves over time. The transformation affects the entire dynamics of the circuit by altering the input, resulting in a different current at any time \\\\(T\\\\).",
