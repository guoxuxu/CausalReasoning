  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over the interval from 0 to T without further intervention, will \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) be equivalent to simply integrating \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over the same interval without applying \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) effectively alters the function to be integrated by weighting it with \\\\(e^{-i\\\\omega s}\\\\), which is a modulation of the frequency. This changes the result of the integral, specifically neutralizing the effect of the exponential term present in \\\\(z(t)\\\\), and is not the same as the unweighted integral of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
