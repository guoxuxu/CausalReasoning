  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} x(s) ds \\\\), with A being a constant square matrix. The input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using the function \\\\( g(t, x) = e^{Bt} x \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) is applied to the input function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the given integral transformation without further intervention, will \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly used in the transformation to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) modifies the input function, thus changing the initial conditions of the transformation. The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) potentially alters the nature of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) contributing to different results in the transformed output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) due to variation in integration with respect to the modified input.",
