  "Problem": "We investigate a signal processing system characterized by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system governed by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = h(t) * x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system’s impulse response and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied to the signal defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce from the transformed output \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\) whether the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was modified by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in \\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\) reflect modifications in the input, without additional information or constraints such as the specific form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), multiple different modifications or even different original signals could yield the same transformed output. The causal relationship from \\\\\\\\( \\\\hat{y}(\\\\omega) \\\\\\\\) to the specifics of the modification on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is not unambiguously determinable without further data.",
