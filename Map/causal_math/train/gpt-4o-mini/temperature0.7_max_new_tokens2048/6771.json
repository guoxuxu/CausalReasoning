  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is altered by adding a harmonic component \\\\( \\beta e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\\\), will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\beta \\\\) and not on initial conditions set by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added harmonic component \\\\( \\beta e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\\\) introduces a new peak in the Fourier transform at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\). However, its amplitude and phase are also influenced by the earlier state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) including the scalar factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\). Therefore, the transform at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\) depends both on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\).",
