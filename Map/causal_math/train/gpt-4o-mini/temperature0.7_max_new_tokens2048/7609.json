  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\(z(t)\\) described by the differential equation \\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\(\\omega\\) is a real constant frequency. Now analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nIf \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to \\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\) from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\), and then \\( T(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\), will the function \\( T(z(t)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be equivalent to directly applying \\( T(z) \\) on \\( z(t) \\) evolved to \\( t = T \\) without the dynamical system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T(z) \\) integrates \\( z(t) \\) multiplied by the complex exponential \\( e^{-i\\omega s} \\), which essentially acts as an inverse transformation to the original dynamics given by \\( e^{i\\omega s} \\), thus nullifying the effect of the evolution under \\( i\\omega \\). Therefore, the computation of \\( T(z(t)) \\) remains consistent irrespective of whether it is computed directly at \\( t = T \\) or sequentially.",
