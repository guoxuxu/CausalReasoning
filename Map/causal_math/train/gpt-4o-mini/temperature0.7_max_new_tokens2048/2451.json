  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. Evaluate the system's response to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(s-t)M}z(s) ds \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)N}z(s) ds \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, is applied at an intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original differential equations and not by the transformations M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( T[z] \\\\) and \\\\( U[z] \\\\) both alter the course and contribution of the variables in the differential equations, hence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends critically not just on A, B, C, and D but also on how the transformations M and N have interacted with these parameters and the system's state over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state of the function z(t) is influenced by the variables x(t) and y(t), which evolve according to the differential equations defined by A, B, C, and D. The integral transformations T[z] and U[z] modify the function z(s) but do not alter the fundamental dynamics dictated by the differential equations. Therefore, the final state z(T) for T greater than t_1 is determined by the original differential equations rather than the transformations M or N.",
