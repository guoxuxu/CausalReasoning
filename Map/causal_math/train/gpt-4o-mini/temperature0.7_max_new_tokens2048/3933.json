  "Problem": "Consider a fluid mechanic system where the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t \\\\vec{v} + (\\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{v} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{v} \\\\). We introduce a scalar field temperature \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) affected by both convection and diffusion, described by the advection-diffusion equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t T + \\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla T = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) undergoes a sudden change at t = 0 due to an external force, will the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) at a later time T still obey the original advection-diffusion equation dynamics without considering this change in velocity?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the velocity field directly affects the convective term \\\\( \\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla T \\\\) in the advection-diffusion equation. This alteration changes the way temperature is transported and diffused across the medium, resulting in different temperature distributions.",
