  "Problem": "Let the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Consider an intervention where a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i \\theta t}z + c \\\\), with constants \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\), is applied.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z + k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions, i.e., \\\\( z(0) \\\\) becomes \\\\( e^{i \\theta \\cdot 0}z_0 + c = z_0 + c \\\\). This modification shifts the trajectory from what would have been if only the original dynamical system without \\\\( g(z) \\\\) had acted. The evolution paths will differ due to the altered starting point and the presence of the constant \\\\( c \\\\).",
