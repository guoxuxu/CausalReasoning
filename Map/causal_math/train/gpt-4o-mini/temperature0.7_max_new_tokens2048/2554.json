  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the temperature distribution, u(x,t), in a rod over time t is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) represents a cooling process influenced by a cooling constant \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T, can the original temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be determined without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) alters the scale of the original temperature distribution. Without clear information whether this transformation was applied, it's impossible to reconstruct the exact initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) just from the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), as this transformation could mask the original values through exponential scaling.",
