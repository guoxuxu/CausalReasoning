  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. This function is subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}z(t) \\\\), where A is a real number, and then transformed by \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), will the resulting transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) underwent the transformation without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) introduces a factor of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) which alters the time dependency of z. This exponential factor changes the rate of decay or growth in the integrand, affecting the values of the integral transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Thus, the output will be inherently different.",
