  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nGiven \\( y(t) \\), can we unequivocally infer \\( x(t) \\) without knowing \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\( H(f) \\), it's impossible to accurately deduce \\( x(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\) because the transformation \\( H(f) \\) could modify \\( X(f) \\) in ways that cannot be reverse-engineered without precise knowledge of \\( H(f) \\).",
