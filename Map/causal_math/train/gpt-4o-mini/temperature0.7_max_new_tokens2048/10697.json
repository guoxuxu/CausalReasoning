  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The influence of a linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\) is analyzed, with D being another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further manipulation, will the vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to just evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\). Unless D commutes with the exponential of M, the new initial condition \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\) evolves differently under \\\\( M \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T compared to the untransformed initial condition.",
