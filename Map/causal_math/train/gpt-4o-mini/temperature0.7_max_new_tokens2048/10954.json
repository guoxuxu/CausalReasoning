  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore how the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) and its modification by a function \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affect the system.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we infer the exact initial configuration \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing the intermediate states?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity and reversibility of the Fourier transform and heat equation under ideal conditions (no loss or external input), it is theoretically feasible to compute the inverse Fourier transform and use it with the fundamental solution of the heat equation to deduce \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) precisely.",
