  "Problem": "Assume we have a system described by a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The influence of an integral transformation represented by \\\\( h(t) = (\\\\int_0^t e^{Bs} ds) x \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it is challenging to infer back to the original state \\\\( x \\\\) since the transformation effects of \\\\( \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs} ds \\\\) could have significantly altered the initial conditions.",
