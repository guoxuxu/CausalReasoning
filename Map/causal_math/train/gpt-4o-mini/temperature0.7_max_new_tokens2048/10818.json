  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real frequency. Assess the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau} z(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the transformed state \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing it a priori?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the system's evolution, losing specific information about the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the integral's averaging effect. The specific phase information of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered.",
