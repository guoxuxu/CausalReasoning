  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where x is a fixed complex number, and A is a complex constant. We investigate the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after applying the integral transformation \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( w(t) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original complex number \\\\( x \\\\) or the value of A, assuming no intervention was applied during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integration of a complex exponential function results in an expression where coefficients contain both the effects of A and x. Due to the nature of exponential and integral, extracting A or x uniquely from \\\\( w(t) \\\\) directly without additional information on either the initial phase or other external constraints is generally not feasible.",
