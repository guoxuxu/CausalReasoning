  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = T^{-1}e^{Dt}Tx \\\\) is considered, where T is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T knowing that \\\\( h(x) \\\\) may or may not have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), and without additional information about T and D relative to M, the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be accurately deduced from \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The transformations due to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could involve rotation, scaling, or more complex changes depending on the interplay of T, D, and M.",
