  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex-valued functions defined in the complex plane and the application of the Laplace transform, which is represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Analyze the behavior and relationships when these functions are subjected to transformations like multiplication by a constant or modification by an exponential decay factor.\n\nIf a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where a is a complex number, is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to its transform properties without further intervention, will the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) at any point s recover the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), provided Re(s) > Re(a). The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) recoveries the original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), showing that the Laplace transformation is reversible for this function under these conditions.",
