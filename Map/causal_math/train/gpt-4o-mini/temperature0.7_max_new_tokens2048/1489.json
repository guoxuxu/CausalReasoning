  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The equation determines the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) as a function of time \\\\( t \\\\) on a unit circle in the complex plane. Analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwt_0} \\\\) at \\\\( t = t_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwt_0} \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) is applied, it changes the initial condition to \\\\( z(t_0)^k \\\\). This alteration results in a different trajectory where instead the function evolves as \\\\( e^{ikwt} \\\\) from \\\\( t_0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), fundamentally changing the point at \\\\( t = T \\\\) due to differing frequencies in the exponent compared to direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
