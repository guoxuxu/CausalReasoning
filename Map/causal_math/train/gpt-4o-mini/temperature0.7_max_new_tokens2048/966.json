  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial complex amplitude and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore causal relations incorporating the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + ce^{i\\delta t} \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) being a complex constant and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) a frequency.\n\nCan the original amplitude \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely determined from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) given that the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) might have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The additional term introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), specifically the frequency-dependent part \\\\( ce^{i\\delta T} \\\\), means the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) contains contributions that might not be disentangled from the original amplitude \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing the specifics of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\delta \\\\). This complicates retroactively determining \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely.",
