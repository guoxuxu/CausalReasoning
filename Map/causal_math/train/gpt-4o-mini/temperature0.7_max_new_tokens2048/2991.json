  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. We are examining the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) which maps \\( z(t) \\) into the s-domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z'(t) = z(t)e^{ct} \\) at some \\( t_1 \\geq 0 \\), where \\( c \\) is a real number, is the Laplace transform of this new function given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z'(t)\\} \\) still a simple rational function of \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z'(t) = e^{(a+c + bi)t} \\), and its Laplace transform is \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+c+bi)} \\). This remains a simple rational function in \\( s \\), but with a shifted pole.",
