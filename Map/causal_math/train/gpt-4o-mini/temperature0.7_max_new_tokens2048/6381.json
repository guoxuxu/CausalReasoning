  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function describes a rotation in the complex plane over time t. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T, and then is evolved further without additional intervention, will the transformed state at t = T affect the future state beyond T, if no further transformations are applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) computes the area under the curve of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to t = T, resulting in a specific complex value. However, post t = T, the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will continue to evolve independently of the integration outcome previously calculated, as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) only depends on omega and t.",
