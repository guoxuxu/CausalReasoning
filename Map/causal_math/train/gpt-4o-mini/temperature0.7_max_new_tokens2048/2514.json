  "Problem": "Given a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix, consider examining the impact of the linear transformation \\( T(x) = Qx \\) for a matrix \\( Q \\). We investigate how this affects the system across different time points.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( T(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( T(x) \\), reconstructing \\( x_0 \\) uniquely is impossible as \\( Q \\) could have altered \\( x_0 \\) to any vector within the range of \\( Q \\). This introduces an ambiguity in tracing back the original state.",
