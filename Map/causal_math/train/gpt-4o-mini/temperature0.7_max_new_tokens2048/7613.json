  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a channel described by the complex potential function \\\\( w(z) = Uz + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\ln(z) \\\\), which represents a combination of uniform flow and a source at the origin. Here, \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex position variable.\n\nIf the fluid flow's parameters \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are increased proportionally and no other changes are done to the flow, will the type of singularity at the origin remain a simple source?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) proportionally only scales up the velocity and flux respectively without changing the nature of the flow around the origin. The logarithmic term responsible for the source type singularity remains unaltered in form, hence the type of singularity remains a simple source.",
