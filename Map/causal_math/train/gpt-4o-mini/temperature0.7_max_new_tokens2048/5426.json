  "Problem": "Given the complex function defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), assess the effect of a contour integration transformation where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) traces a path specified by functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the complex plane from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nCan the specific path \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that was followed be accurately reconstructed from the integral result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) along that path, assuming no information about the initial and final points is known?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of complex functions and their integrals, multiple paths could yield the same integration result. Without additional information regarding the bounds or specific path characteristics like curvature, a unique \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be determined solely from integral results.",
