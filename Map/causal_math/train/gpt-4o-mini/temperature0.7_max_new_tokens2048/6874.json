  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and K is a complex constant matrix. Let the transformation function be \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is another complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is uncertain how the state was transformed initially. Since \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) might have changed the initial vector in a non-inverse manner or in a way dependent on A's properties, deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely is infeasible.",
