  "Problem": "Consider a function system described by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. This system undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( I(w) = \\\\int w(z) dz \\\\) applied over a certain path in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is computed and then transformed by \\\\( I(w) \\\\) without any additional functions applied to it, will the integral transformation result at any contour path being the same as the integral of \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) directly over that path?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( I(w) \\\\) of the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) calculated directly over any given path in the complex plane will indeed result in the same value as directly integrating \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) over the same path, since no modifications or external functions alter this direct relationship.",
