  "Problem": "Let us consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We analyze how this function transforms under the application of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) and also how it behaves when modified by a scheduled intervention described as multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\).\n\nGiven that we observe an endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after an intervention, is it possible to ascertain precisely whether the intervention \\\\( cz(t_1) \\\\) was made, solely based on the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from different interventions due to the general properties of complex exponentials and their rotations. The endpoint does not uniquely determine whether the specific intervention of multiplying by \\\\( c \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) was applied, especially if not all parameters (like T and t_1 relative to the phase introduced by c) are known.",
