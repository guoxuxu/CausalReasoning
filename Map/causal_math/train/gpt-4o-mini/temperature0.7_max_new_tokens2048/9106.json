  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), can we determine if \\\\( T \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) or knowledge about the original trajectory, it is impossible to definitely ascertain whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, as multiple transformations could result in similar trajectories depending on their parameters.",
