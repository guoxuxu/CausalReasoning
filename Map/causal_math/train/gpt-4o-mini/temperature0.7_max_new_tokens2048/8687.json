  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nIf an additional decay function \\( e^{-bt} \\) is applied as an intervention at some \\( t_1 \\), will the ultimate form of \\( z(w) \\) be influenced only by \\( a \\) and not \\( b \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding \\( e^{-bt} \\) at \\( t_1 \\) significantly modifies the decay characteristics of \\( \\phi(t) \\), influencing both the rate and the ultimate spectral form. Thus \\( z(w) \\) will reflect the characteristics derived from both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).",
