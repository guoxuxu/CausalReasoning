  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the state of the system and c is a constant wave speed. Consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the interval [0,T], an intervention changing c to a different constant wave speed \\\\( c' \\\\) is applied, will the state of the system \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on the original wave speed c?",
  "Explanation": "The new wave speed \\\\( c' \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward alters the propagation characteristics of the system, and hence the state at T would be dependent on both c and \\\\( c' \\\\), indicating a dependency on both the initial conditions manipulated by \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and modified propagation characteristics due to the change in wave speed.",
