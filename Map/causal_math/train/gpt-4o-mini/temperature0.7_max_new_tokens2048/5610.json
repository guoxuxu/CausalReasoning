  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a set of linear algebraic equations driven by a matrix function \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\), where A is a diagonalizable matrix. We further examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At}X(t) dt \\\\) on the system.\n\nIf \\\\( X(T) \\\\) is observed and known to result from an evolution described by \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( X_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(X) \\\\) was applied at any point?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the application of the transformation \\\\( g(X) \\\\), it is not feasible to reverse-engineer the exact initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) because the integral transformation can significantly modify the trajectory that \\\\( X(t) \\\\) would follow from any guessed \\\\( X_0 \\\\).",
