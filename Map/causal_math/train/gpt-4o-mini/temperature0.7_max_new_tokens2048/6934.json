  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z \\), respectively. The evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( z(t) \\) at arbitrary \\( t_0 \\) after observing \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\( f(z) \\), recovering the exact original function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t_0 \\) is not feasible. The integral transformation \\( f(z) \\) can significantly alter the trajectory, and without knowing \\( N \\) and the specifics of its impact, the initial function is ambiguous.",
