  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We study the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over complex variable s and real variable t.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s = i, can we determine precisely whether the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\) was applied as an intervention during the transformation from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the transformed function may show deviations from the expected form, without specific knowledge of \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) or the form of the deviations introduced by the intervention, it is not possible to unambiguously determine the presence or specifics of the intervention based solely on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a particular value of s.",
