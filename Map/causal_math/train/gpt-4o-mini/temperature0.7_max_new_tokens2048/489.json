  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), with M being a constant matrix. We examine the system's behavior under the influence of a linear operator \\\\(h(z) = Sz\\\\), where S is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) operates on a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to change under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T evolve identically as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) had just been subjected to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) starting at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The operation of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) adjusts the starting vector, altering the trajectory of the system. The evolution under \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) starting from \\\\(Sz_0\\\\) typically does not coincide with that from \\\\(z_0\\\\) unless S commutes with M, thus leading to a different state at time T.",
