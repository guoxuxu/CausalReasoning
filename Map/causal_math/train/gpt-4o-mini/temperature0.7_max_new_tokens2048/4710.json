  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could have been influenced by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) without this knowledge, differentiating the initial conditions isn't feasible. Especially if \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) have non-commuting properties, tracing back the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately becomes impossible.",
