  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes analysis under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation could have altered the initial state by any complex scaling factor \\\\( e^{kT} \\\\), making it infeasible to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely.",
