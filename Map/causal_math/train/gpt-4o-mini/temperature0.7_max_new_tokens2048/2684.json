  "Problem": "Examine a response system governed by the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\) of a function \\(x(t)\\). Assume an exponential function \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) acts on \\(x(t)\\) and modifies its behaviour in the Laplace domain.\n\nCan we precisely determine the functional form of the intervention \\(g(t)\\) based solely on observing the transformed result \\(X(s-k)e^{-s\\tau}\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformed result \\(X(s-k)e^{-s\\tau}\\) indicates a shift and a scaling, multiple interventions or different parameters \\(k\\) and \\(\\tau\\) can yield a similar effect in the Laplace domain. Without additional data, identifying the exact nature of \\(g(t)\\) and separation from \\(k\\) is ambiguous.",
