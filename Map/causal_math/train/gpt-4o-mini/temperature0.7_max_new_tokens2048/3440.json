  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\( F(z) \\), \\( G(z) \\), or both) were applied, purely by observing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on \\( z(T) \\) is challenging because different combinations of \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) values can yield similar or even identical states at \\( T \\), especially given the complex interactions and the effects of exponentials in complex planes, leading to non-unique solutions.",
