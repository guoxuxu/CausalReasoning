  "Problem": "In a study of fluid dynamics, let \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid on a plane, subject to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\). We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed field \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, T) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the initial field \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) using an inverse Fourier transform without knowing the specific initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform reconstructs the spatial structure at time T, but losses about phases or certain harmonic components altered by the dynamics might prevent accurate reversion to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), unless very specific properties of the PDE are met.",
