  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over time t, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number. We are interested in the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds\\\\) applied to z.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is described by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) and allowed to evolve naturally without applying the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\), will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) after time T be the same as if \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied at each time t?",
  "Explanation": "The natural evolution of \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) represents a movement along the unit circle in the complex plane, while applying the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) accumulates values of z(t) over time, resulting in a different mathematical object (integral of z(t)) which structurally differs from the mere point \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
