  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effect of multiplying \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by an exponential function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, on the transformed function, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at}h(t)) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at}h(t)) \\\\), can we accurately revert to the unmodified function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at}h(t)) \\\\) shifts the Laplace variable \\\\( s \\\\) to \\\\( s-a \\\\), and without knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\), it is not possible to correctly revert to \\\\( s \\\\), and thus, not possible to restore the original transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\).",
