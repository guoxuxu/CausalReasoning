  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) representing wave propagation, where c is the wave speed. We explore the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to convert the spatial variable into the frequency domain.\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying an additional Fourier transform on the wave function at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and then reversing it immediately, will the final state of the wave function at time T be affected by such intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The double application of the Fourier transform (applying and then immediately reversing it) essentially leaves the state unchanged due to the transform's invertibility and linearity, thereby not affecting the wave function's propagation or final state at time T.",
