  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = -RI + E(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, I is the current, and E(t) is a time-varying electromotive force. An analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of adding a linear filter \\\\( f(I) = CI \\\\) where C is a constant, initially at time t = 0.\n\nCan we deduce the original current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the filter \\\\( f(I) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the filter was applied, the observed \\\\( I(t) \\\\) could correspond to multiple initial currents due to the transformation by the constant C, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( I_0 \\\\).",
