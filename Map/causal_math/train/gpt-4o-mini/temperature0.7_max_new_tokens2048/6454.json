  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\(\\partial_t u = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) applied to the function \\(u(x, 0)\\) at \\(t = 0\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\(u(x, 0)\\) from the state \\(u(x, T)\\) at time \\(T\\) without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied, it's impossible to reliably trace back to \\(u(x, 0)\\) since the evolution could represent either a transformed or a non-transformed state, and these states would evolve differently under the operator \\(L\\).",
