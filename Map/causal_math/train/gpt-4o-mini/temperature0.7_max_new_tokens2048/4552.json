  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature change over time is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\), where k is a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) applied at different times.\n\nGiven the observed temperature \\\\( T(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to determine precisely which transformations or interventions (\\\\( f(T) \\\\) and/or \\\\( g(T) \\\\)) were applied, solely based on knowing \\\\( T(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the previous cases without intervention, the end temperature can be achieved through various combinations of transformations and interventions. The effect of these on the trajectory isn't uniquely reversible, especially when exponential and polynomial functions interact in complex ways, leading to potential overlapping results at \\\\( T(T) \\\\).",
