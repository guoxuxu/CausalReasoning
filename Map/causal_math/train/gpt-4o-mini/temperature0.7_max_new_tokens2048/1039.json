  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt\\\\) where z is a complex variable and f(t) represents a real-valued function of t. This integral transform is fundamental in solving differential equations and analyzing signal systems.\n\nIf a transformation by a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) (where a is a constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and subsequently the integral transformation is applied, will the resulting \\\\(u(z)\\\\) be unaffected by the value of a?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) changes the form of the function being transformed. This results in a new transformation outcome \\\\(u(z-a)\\\\), which clearly depends on the parameter a. Therefore, the resulting transformed function \\\\(u(z)\\\\) is affected by the intervention.",
