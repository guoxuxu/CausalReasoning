  "Problem": "A system is governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + Az\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We explore the role of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is a different constant matrix influencing the trajectory over time t.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 correctly after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, any back-calculation from the observed state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes imprecise. The transformation could have modified initial conditions uniquely, making them irretrievable without additional information about the application of B.",
