  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = c(t) + id(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the initial signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( F \\\\) and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without transformation was directly analyzed at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator and does not change the frequency content of the signal. Transforming the signal and then analyzing at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) simply provides the spectral component at that frequency, identical to analyzing the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
