  "Problem": "Consider the interaction between two functions defined over scalar fields, \\\\( u(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and \\\\( v(z) = e^{bz} \\\\), where a and b are constants, in the context of an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left( h(z) \\\\right) = \\\\int_0^z u(\\\\tau) v(z - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at any \\\\( z > 0 \\\\), can we uniquely determine the constants a and b without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining a and b from \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alone is not feasible due to the inherent mathematical properties of convolution; multiple combinations of a and b can yield indistinguishable results in \\\\( h(z) \\\\), particularly without knowing the specific forms or relations of u and v.",
