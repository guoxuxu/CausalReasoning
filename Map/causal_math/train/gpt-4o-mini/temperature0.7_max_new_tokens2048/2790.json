  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and its transformation by an integral operator \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi e^{-it}z(t) dt \\\\). Analyze this transformation and its properties.\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the integral operation by \\\\( T \\\\) is akin to a Fourier transform at a specific frequency, the output, which evaluates to zero, does not provide enough information to uniquely recover the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). This highlights the loss of original information through the transformation by \\\\( T \\\\).",
