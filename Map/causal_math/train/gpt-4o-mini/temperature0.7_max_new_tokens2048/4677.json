  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), a complex exponential where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real parameter representing frequency. We inspect the behavior of this function under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) over domain \\\\( x \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and then allowed to naturally evolve over domain \\\\( x \\\\) with no further modification, will \\\\( T(z(x)) \\\\) at \\\\( x = X \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( T(z(0))e^{iwx} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the function by adding the constant term \\\\( b \\\\) and scaling by \\\\( a \\\\), leading to a different trajectory than simply scaling \\\\( z(0) \\\\) by the exponential factor \\\\( e^{iwx} \\\\). The operation \\\\( az(x) + b \\\\) at any point \\\\( x \\\\) does not only depend on the scaling factor \\\\( e^{iwx} \\\\) but also introduces the constant shift \\\\( b \\\\), thereby altering the inherent dynamics.",
