  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is unclear if the initial conditions were altered by the transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z_0 \\\\). This ambiguity prevents the unique determination of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the scaling by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) could complicate the reverse calculation.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex-valued function z(t) at time T can influence the original complex number z_0 at time t = 0. The application of the transformation function f(z) is influenced by z(t), and in turn, f(z) impacts the deduction of z_0. The derivative of z, denoted as dot{z}, is influenced by both the constants omega and kappa, which also affect the value of z. Additionally, the transformation function f(z) is dependent on the time variable t.",
