  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. Evaluate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where Q is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the output after time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing it follows the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), can we precisely infer the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if there was an application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depends on an integration across the function's evolution, this aggregation obfuscates the direct traceability back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Individual characteristics of the original state are obscured by the integral, making it impossible to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely without explicit knowledge of having not applied \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
