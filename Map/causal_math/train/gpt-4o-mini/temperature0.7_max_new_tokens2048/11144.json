  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = w^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We evaluate the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the output of the transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine exactly which parts of the path were altered as an intervention if we know the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation does not inherently carry enough information to precisely back-trace which segments of the path were altered as interventions; different paths could yield similar transformations, especially given the complexity of exponential and power functions in the complex plane.",
