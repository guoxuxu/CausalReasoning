  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) with an initial input \\( z_0 \\). The system undergoes a transformation \\( h(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Et}z dt \\), where E is a constant matrix and T is the final time.\n\nAfter observing \\( z(T) \\), can we infer the initial state \\( z_0 \\) without knowing whether the transformation \\( h(z) \\) was applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( h(z) \\) and considering the effects of the integration and matrix exponential \\( e^{Et} \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine the original state \\( z_0 \\) because the initial conditions could have been modified in various ways by the integral transformation.",
