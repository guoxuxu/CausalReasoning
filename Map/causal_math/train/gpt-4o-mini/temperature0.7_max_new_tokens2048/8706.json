  "Problem": "Analyze a transfer function H(s) in the Laplace transform domain. Consider a linear system characterized by H(s) = 1/(s^2 + as + b), where a and b are constants. Let's study the impact of applying a unit step input U(s) = 1/s, and how it influences the system response.\n\nCan the original control input U(s) to a linear time-invariant system be uniquely determined after observing the output Y(s) at time t = T without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific transfer function H(s) or without deconvolution capabilities, determining U(s) just from Y(s) is generally not possible because multiple distinct inputs can produce similar outputs in such systems.",
