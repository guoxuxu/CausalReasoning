  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = a+bt+ict^2 \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants, and study the application of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), after applying a damping intervention, can we precisely identify whether only the damping factor was applied or if there were also changes to \\\\( a, b, c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) after intervention includes the effects of both the potential changes to \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) and the application of the damping factor. These transformations' combined effects make it challenging to isolate and identify the specific types of changes or interventions applied solely based on the Fourier Transform.",
