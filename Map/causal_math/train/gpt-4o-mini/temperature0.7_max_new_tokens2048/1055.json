  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) represents the Fourier space variable, on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a filtering operation characterized by a function \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\) is applied in Fourier space, will the final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\) alters the state in Fourier space, affecting the components of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) based on the filter characteristics. This change will directly affect the final state at time T, making it dependent on both \\\\(L\\\\) and the nature of \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\).",
