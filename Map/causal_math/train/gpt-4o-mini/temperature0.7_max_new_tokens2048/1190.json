  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function transforms according to another complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). The system's development is examined over time under the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and the results are compared to an untransformed approach.\n\nCan we infer the original function form at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) accurately after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was implemented?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and the absence of it result in different trajectories, the ending state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone doesn't give direct evidence concerning whether the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied or not without the additional knowledge of intervention.",
