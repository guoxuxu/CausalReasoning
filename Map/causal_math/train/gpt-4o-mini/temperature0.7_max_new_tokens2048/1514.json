  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency of the system. We explore the effects of a linear transformation \\\\(T(x) = Ax + B\\\\), where A and B are matrices, on the system's state.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t, can we determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), we cannot reliably trace back to \\\\(x_0\\\\) due to the potential alteration caused by A and B. The system’s trajectory might have been significantly altered making it impossible to uniquely deduce the correct initial state.",
