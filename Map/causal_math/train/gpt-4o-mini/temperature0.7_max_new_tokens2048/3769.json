  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\leq 0 \\\\) and then the system evolves without further intervention, will the transformed function at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was transformed at t = T directly?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) applied initially changes the trajectory of the function. Because \\\\( T \\\\) depends on the integral up to that time, the resulting function at any time t will reflect the accumulated history of the transformation, which is different from directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) at t = T.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The complex-valued function z(t) directly influences the transformation T[f](t), which then affects the resulting transformed function over time. If z(t) is less than or equal to zero, this condition also impacts the transformation T[f](t). Once T[f](t) is applied, the system evolves based on this transformation, leading to the transformed function at time T. However, transforming z(t) directly at time T would yield a different outcome than applying T[f](t) first and then allowing the system to evolve.",
