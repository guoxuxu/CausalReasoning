  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system's behavior is analyzed after applying the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( L \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( L \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be uniquely determined without knowledge of whether any transformation or specific initial condition was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the differential equation governing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) provides a unique solution in the s-domain which can be inverse transformed to obtain \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and hence \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and transformation are inherently encoded within the transform's properties and the known linear structure of the governing equation.",
