  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to a frequency variable.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at some time T > 0 without knowledge of the intervening Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Given the invertibility of the Fourier transform and its preservation of information in a linear PDE setting, the evolution can be reversed using the inverse Fourier transform after applying the inverse of the linear operator \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\). Thus, even if the transform was initially unknown, it does not alter the backward traceability in the context of this linear PDE system.",
