  "Problem": "In a control system, the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear system \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. A transformation is applied defined by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations and control inputs were used (both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\)), merely by observing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to retroactively determine all interventions (both the transformation applied and the control inputs used). The contributions of \\\\( F \\\\) in \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) to the state trajectory leave multiple possible combinations of factors that could result in the same endpoint.",
