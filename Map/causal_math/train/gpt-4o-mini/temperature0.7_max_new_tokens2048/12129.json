  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a set of coupled differential equations. Analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( u(s) \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nCan the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be uniquely determined at time 0 after observing \\\\( z(T1) \\\\) at time T1 without information about whether the transformation by \\\\( u(s) \\\\) was applied during [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( u(s) \\\\) was involved, multiple transformations could yield the same resulting state at T1. The integral transformation could have altered the system’s trajectory in various ways, making it impossible to backtrack with certainty to the original state at time 0.",
