  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we have a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tx} dt \\\\), and we wish to analyze how transformations influence the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) through various manipulations, involving either differentiation under the integral sign or Laplace Transform.\n\nIf a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z(x)) = z(ax) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without further manipulations, will \\\\( L(z(x)) \\\\) at \\\\( x = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(x) \\\\) was directly calculated at \\\\( x = aT \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation scales the variable inside the integral linearly which corresponds to the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) of function under exponent. Therefore, the resultant function \\\\( L(z(x)) = z(ax) \\\\) at any specific \\\\( x \\\\) is equivalent to evaluating the original function \\\\( z \\\\) at \\\\( ax \\\\).",
