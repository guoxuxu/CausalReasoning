  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nGiven the population distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we exactly determine the initial distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether any transformation like Fourier was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of an intervention such as a Fourier transform at any point, the potential modification to the population distribution introduces uncertainties, making it impossible to infer the exact initial condition directly from the later state using the PDE alone.",
