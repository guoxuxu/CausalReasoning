  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix and z a complex variable. We examine how the integral transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw\\\\) influences behavior over the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is computed for a specific complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), then this value is used as an initial condition in another function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + g(z) \\\\), will \\\\( h(z) \\\\)'s behavior be purely determined by the properties of \\\\( z^2 \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is influenced not only by the squared term but significantly by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which integrates the exponential function driven by matrix A. The exponential component brings additional complexity that is not captured by the square function alone.",
