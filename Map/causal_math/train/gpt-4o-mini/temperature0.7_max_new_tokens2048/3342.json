  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature \\\\( T \\\\) affects the rate of a chemical reaction according to the Arrhenius equation, given by \\\\( R(T) = A e^{-\\\\frac{E}{RT}} \\\\), where \\\\( E \\\\) is the activation energy, \\\\( R \\\\) is the gas constant, and \\\\( A \\\\) is a pre-exponential factor. We need to also consider an intervention by adjusting the temperature profile over time with a function \\\\( f(t) = T_0 + kt \\\\), where \\\\( T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature and \\\\( k \\\\) is the rate of change of temperature.\n\nCan the parameters \\\\( T_0 \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) be uniquely determined from observing the behavior of \\\\( R(T) \\\\) at different times without prior knowledge about \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in \\\\( R(T) \\\\) correlate with temperature changes, multiple combinations of \\\\( T_0 \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) could yield similar patterns in \\\\( R(T) \\\\). Without additional information about the temperature function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), these parameters cannot be uniquely determined.",
