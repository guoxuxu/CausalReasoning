  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane from t = 0 to T, can we determine precisely if there was an intervention such as a change in frequency midway, based solely on this trajectory?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory alone, particularly if only observed for a single cycle or incomplete information, might not reveal if a change in frequency occurred without additional timing information or a baseline for comparison. Multiple setups or frequency shifts could result in similar trajectories.",
