  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions with specific transformations applied.\n\nIf \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is initialized at 1 (i.e., \\\\( z(0) = e^{0} = 1 \\\\)) and allowed to evolve under the given transformation without any intervention, will the path from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be a spiral in the complex plane for any non-zero \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The factor \\\\( e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) naturally leads to a spiral trajectory in the complex plane due to the presence of \\\\( b \\\\), which gives the exponential a rotating component \\\\( e^{bit} \\\\), combined with an exponential growth (\\\\( a > 0 \\\\)) or decay (\\\\( a < 0 \\\\)).",
