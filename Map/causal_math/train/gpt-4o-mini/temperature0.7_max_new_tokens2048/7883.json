  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), to the function u(t).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time t = t_1 such that the function u is multiplied by a scalar constant \\\\( c \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the initial state at t_1 by scaling u, which alters how the solution evolves under L from t_1 to T. Therefore, the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) depends on both the scalar constant \\\\( c \\\\) and the operator L.",
