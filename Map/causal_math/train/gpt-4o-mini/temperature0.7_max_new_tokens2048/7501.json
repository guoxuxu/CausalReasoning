  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect the effects on the function when it is subjected to a Fourier transformation, given by \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is directly subjected to a Fourier transformation, will the resulting function \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) \\\\) be equivalent to \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) specifically when \\( \\xi = \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) results in a delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\). Hence, the value of \\( F(z)(\\xi) \\) is non-zero only when \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), demonstrating the pure frequency component of the original function corresponding to its intrinsic frequency \\( \\omega \\).",
