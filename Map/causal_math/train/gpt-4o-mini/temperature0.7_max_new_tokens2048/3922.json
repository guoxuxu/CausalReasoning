  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t is time. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T, can we recover the exact original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) for all t in [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) introduces ambiguities; multiple functions could yield the same integrated result due to the loss of specific phase information at individual times.",
