  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions used based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the possibility of having several combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) that result in the same phase shift. The contribution of each transformation cannot be disentangled without additional information about their application.",
