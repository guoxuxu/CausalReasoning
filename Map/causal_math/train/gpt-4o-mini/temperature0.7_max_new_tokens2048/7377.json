  "Problem": "Consider a system is modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t) + ig(t) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. Integral operator \\\\( K \\\\) defined by \\\\( K[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during its evolution.\n\nIf the initial state of the system is given by \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and allowed to evolve under the influence of \\\\( K \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( K[z](t) \\\\) at time T solely reflect the transformation properties of \\\\( K \\\\), independent of the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( K[z](t) \\\\) incorporates contributions from all preceding states up to time t due to the integral operator. While \\\\( K \\\\) defines the system's response to its past states, the dependence on the initial conditions \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is inherent in defining its evolution. Therefore, the output at any time T is contingent on both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
