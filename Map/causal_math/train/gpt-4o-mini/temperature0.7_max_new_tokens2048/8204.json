  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( z \\) depends on the input \\( x \\) through a linear transformation and an integral transform with kernel \\( K(s, t) \\). Specifically, \\( z(t) = \\int_0^T K(s, t) x(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( T \\) is a fixed time horizon.\n\nGiven \\( z(T) \\), can we pinpoint whether an intervention affecting \\( x(s) \\) was applied at \\( t_1 \\) merely by analyzing \\( z(T) \\) without full knowledge of \\( K(s, t) \\) or \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without comprehensive knowledge of the kernel \\( K(s, t) \\) and the intervention matrix \\( B \\), it's challenging to discern from \\( z(T) \\) alone whether an intervention occurred. Different kernels and interventions might result in similar outputs, making it ambiguous.",
