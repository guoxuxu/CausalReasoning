  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\), governing the temperature distribution u(x,t) in a rod along x axis. We consider the impact of an initial temperature distribution manipulated by the function \\\\(g(u) = Au + h\\\\), where A is a constant and h is a constant function.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(u) = Au + h \\\\) alters the initial condition of the temperature distribution, and this modified initial condition will evolve differently under the heat equation. The linear transformation and the addition of the constant function h generally change the temperature evolution.",
