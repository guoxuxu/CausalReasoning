  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled with Laplace transforms in the complex function space, where the transfer function H(s) relates the input U(s) to the output Y(s) by Y(s) = H(s)U(s). Let's investigate how the addition of a complex pole affects the system behavior.\n\nGiven the output Y(s) for some s, can we determine if a pole was added to the original H(s), without knowing the exact form of U(s)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of U(s) and the original form of H(s), determining whether a pole has been added based solely on observing Y(s) is not feasible. The influence of U(s) and potential other modifications to H(s) obscure the singular effect of the new pole.",
