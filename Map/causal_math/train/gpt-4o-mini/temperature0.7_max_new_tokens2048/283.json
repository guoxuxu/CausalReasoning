  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time and i is the imaginary unit. This function describes a unit circle in the complex plane. We study the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) where A is a complex number, representing multiplication and rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = Bz \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t_1) \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on the initial function and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) significantly modify the trajectory of the function. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), calculated as \\\\( B e^{i(T-t_1)} A e^{it_1} \\\\), depends on both A and B as well as their timing and sequence.",
