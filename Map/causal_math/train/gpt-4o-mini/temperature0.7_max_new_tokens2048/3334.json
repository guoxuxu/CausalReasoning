  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) applied to elements in the complex plane. We analyze the effects of performing a linear transformation on z via a matrix M before and after applying the function.\n\nCan we recover the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing which process (matrix first or function first) was applied after observing the final outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the order of operations (whether the matrix or the function was applied first), the final outcome cannot uniquely determine the original complex number due to the non-commutative nature of the operations involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
