  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. This function models a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). Additionally, analyze the impact of a Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), and its implications on causality inferences.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the result of a Laplace transform at any later time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if calculated directly at that time?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at any time will consistently yield \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), independent of the specific time \\\\( t \\\\) chosen, due to the time-invariance property of the exponential function in the context of Laplace transforms.",
