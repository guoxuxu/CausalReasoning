  "Problem": "Let us consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) represents a control input vector. The Laplace transform \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) applied to this system results in \\( X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + (sI - A)^{-1}x(0) \\) where \\( U(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\).\n\nIf a different matrix \\( C \\) is used to modify the system matrix \\( A \\) to \\( A+C \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will this change reflect in the Laplace transform \\( X(s) \\) for all values of \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the system matrix from \\( A \\) to \\( A+C \\) changes the system dynamics, which is reflected in the Laplace transform through the term \\( (sI - (A+C))^{-1} \\). This change affects how the system responds to inputs and initial conditions, thus modifying \\( X(s) \\) across all complex values \\( s \\).",
