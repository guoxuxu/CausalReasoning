  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the temperature distribution, u(x,t), in a rod over time t is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) represents a cooling process influenced by a cooling constant \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new temperature regulating function \\\\( g(u) = e^{-\\mu t}u \\\\) (where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be affected only by the parameter k and not by \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) further modifies the system by scaling it with another exponential decay factor, \\\\( e^{-\\mu t} \\\\). Therefore, the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will be influenced by the initial transformation as well as the new intervention, making it dependent on k, \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), and \\\\( \\mu \\\\), showing how multiple factors interactively affect the heat distribution.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The heat distribution u(x,t) is influenced by the thermal diffusivity k, which affects the rate of change of temperature over time. The cooling process described by the function f(u) is affected by the cooling constant λ, while the new temperature regulating function g(u) is influenced by the constant μ. The endpoint temperature u(x, T) is determined by the temperature distribution at time T, which is influenced by both the thermal diffusivity k and the temperature regulating functions f(u) and g(u), thus showing that λ and μ also play a role in the endpoint temperature.",
