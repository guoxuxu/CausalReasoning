  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z \\) defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We study the effect of adding a linear transformation represented by \\( T(z) = az + b \\) (where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants) on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( T(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of application of \\( T(z) \\), the transformation could have shifted the phase or scaled the amplitude, which cannot be exactly determined or reversed without additional information about \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).",
