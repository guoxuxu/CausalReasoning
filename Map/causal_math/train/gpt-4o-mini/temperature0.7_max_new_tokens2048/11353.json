  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. \\nWe investigate how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{wt}z\\\\), where w is a complex constant, affects this function over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under the original complex function without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was just evolved under the original complex function to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation alters the initial condition by scaling and possibly rotating it depending on the real and imaginary parts of w. This initial change modifies the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) because the transformation and the evolution under the complex function do not necessarily commute.",
