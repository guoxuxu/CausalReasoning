  "Problem": "Examine the calculation of the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( u(t) = t^2 \\\\) which is then convolved with another function \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t} \\\\). The Laplace transform is a powerful integral transformation used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems responses.\n\nIf an additional scaling factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) is applied during the calculation of the convolution's Laplace transform, does it still equate to the simple product of the individual transforms of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional exponential factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) modifies the original functions within the convolution integral, leading to a Laplace transform that is not merely the product of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v\\\\} \\\\). The convolution theorem cannot be applied straightforwardly in this modified scenario.",
