  "Problem": "Consider the relationship governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), representing the unit circle in the complex plane. Study the behavior of the system when a transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > t_1 only depend on the behavior of \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) from 0 to \\( t_1 \\) and not on the earlier application of \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( g(z) \\) multiplies all prior effects by cubing the current value of \\( z(t) \\). This impact is influenced by whether \\( z(t) \\) had been squared at t = 0 by \\( f(z) \\), as the cubing interacts with however \\( z(t) \\) had been manipulated up until \\( t_1 \\), leading to a compounded transformation at T.",
