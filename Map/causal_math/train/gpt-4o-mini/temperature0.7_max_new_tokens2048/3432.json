  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform applied to a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\), and let the transformed function be \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\). Assume the operation of convolution with another function \\\\(g(x)\\\\) in the time domain, consequently leading to a multiplication by \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\(g(x)\\\\), in the frequency domain.\n\nCan the use of a specific filter \\\\(h(x)\\\\) be determined solely from the final Fourier transform if we know the original transforms \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) and \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise filter used from the final transformed output is challenging without additional specifics about how the output changed relative to the unfiltered case, as multiple different filters can produce similar modifications in the frequency domain.",
