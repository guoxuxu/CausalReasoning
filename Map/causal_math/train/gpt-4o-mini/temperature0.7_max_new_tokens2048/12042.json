  "Problem": "In a control system, an input vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) to produce an output \\\\(y(t) = L[x(t)]\\\\). An additional operator \\\\(M\\\\), a constant matrix, is later used to alter the system's response.\n\nSuppose a transformation \\\\(N\\\\), another constant matrix, is introduced at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention. Will the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(L\\\\) and not on \\\\(M\\\\) or \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the transformation \\\\(N\\\\) alters the system’s behavior forward from \\\\(t_1\\\\). Considering that the system was potentially influenced initially by \\\\(M\\\\), the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) will be influenced by all three operators \\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), and \\\\(N\\\\), showing dependency beyond just \\\\(L\\\\).",
