  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations given by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We investigate the influence of a transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\), where M is another matrix and c is a constant vector, on the solution x.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is applied to a solution vector \\\\(x_0\\\\), and then this transformed vector is used to solve \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) match the original \\\\(x_0\\\\) used if no transformation had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\) alters the initial vector, changing the equation to \\\\(A(Mx + c) = b\\\\). Unless M is the identity matrix and c is the zero vector, the solution vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will generally be different from the original \\\\(x_0\\\\) due to the modification of the system.",
