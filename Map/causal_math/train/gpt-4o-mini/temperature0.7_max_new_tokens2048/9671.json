  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, which follows the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied over a time period \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the system, does the result of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely rely on the original dynamics granted by \\\\( C \\\\) (i.e., \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( S(z) \\\\) as an intervention changes the cumulative trajectory of the function due to the integration, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( C \\\\) but also on the effects of \\\\( S(z) \\\\).",
