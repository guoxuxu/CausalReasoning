  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to periodic external force, modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = f(t)\\\\) where p and q are constants and \\\\(f(t)\\\\) represents the forcing term. We examine the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Ax^2 \\\\) to the state x, where A is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can it be inferred with certainty which transformations (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were initially applied, just by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specifically which transformations were applied based solely on the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is generally impossible due to the non-linearity introduced by the transformations and potential similarities in the resultant states from different initial applications. Without additional constraints or information, the final state can be reached from varying initial transformations.",
