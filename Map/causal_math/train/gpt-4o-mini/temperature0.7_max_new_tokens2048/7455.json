  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) on a function \\\\( w \\\\) in the complex plane over time t. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention by another transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it}w \\\\) is applied, will the state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) at time T depend only on A, ignoring the initial and intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) at time T is influenced by both the initial transformation and the intervening transformation. Each exponential function represents a distinct phase rotation in the complex plane, which will influence the trajectory and endpoint depending on their specific interactions with the matrix A and each other.",
