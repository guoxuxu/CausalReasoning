  "Problem": "We consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real variable and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex number. The function is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) along with the application of a scaling and phase shift operation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{a+ib}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new scaling and phase shift \\\\( g(z) = e^{c+id}z \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( a, b, c, \\\\) or \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further modifies the frequency and phase shift dynamics, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the parameters \\\\( a, b, c, \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This shows that all transformations \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) significantly influence the endpoint.",
