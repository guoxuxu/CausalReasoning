  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic functional integral equation system governed by \\\\(I(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-x^2 + xt} dt\\\\). We examine the effects of applying the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty I(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k)\\\\) is computed for a function I(x) as defined, and no other transformation is applied, does the resulting function fundamentally alter its analytical properties?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of I(x), which involves an exponential quadratic, results in changes to the function's properties, such as its decay rate and oscillatory behavior. The integral transformation alters how the function manifests in the frequency domain.",
