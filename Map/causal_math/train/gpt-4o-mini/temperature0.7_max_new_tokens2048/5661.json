  "Problem": "We explore the impact of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Here, \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and we define it as \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. The differential operator serves as an integral transformation of the function, possibly altering its domain and behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( g(x) = sin(x) \\\\) and is allowed to transform without further intervention, will the transformed function remain equivalent to the original \\\\( g(x) \\\\) in the transformation's domain?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) = sin(x) \\\\) transforms it into a function in the complex plane, specifically \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \\\\). This is not equivalent to the original trigonometric function, indicating a fundamental transformation in domain and functional expression.",
