  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on the solution, specifically, the operation defined by the function g(u) = F(u), where F denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(u) = F^{-1}(u) \\\\) (the inverse Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the initial application of F or F^{-1}?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(u) = F^{-1}(u) \\\\) changes the state back to the time-space domain, which reintroduces the initial dependencies on the Fourier transform properties and L. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is influenced by the transformations F and F^{-1}, together with how L operates in different domains.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The change in the system over time (∂u/∂t) leads to the state of the system (u), which is transformed by the Fourier transform (F) into a new representation (F(u)).
