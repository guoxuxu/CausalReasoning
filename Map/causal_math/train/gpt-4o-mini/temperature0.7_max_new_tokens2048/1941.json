  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\). We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform-based controller defined by \\( G(s) = s + k \\) for some constant \\( k \\) on the system's response.\n\nIf the system \\( H(s) \\) processes an input signal \\( u(t) \\) directly without any controllers, will the output \\( y(t) \\) be unaffected by any changes in \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the controller \\( G(s) \\) is not applied, the output \\( y(t) \\) is determined solely by \\( H(s) \\). Changes in \\( k \\) in the controller equation have no influence on \\( H(s) \\) or the output based solely on this system.",
