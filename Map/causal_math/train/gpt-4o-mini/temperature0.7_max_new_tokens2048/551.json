  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant and determine how this affects the evolution of the function over time.\n\nIf an intervention via another transformation \\\\( U(z) = dz \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant complex number) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by \\\\( a \\\\) and not \\\\( c \\\\) or \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) = dz \\\\) introduces new dynamics. The resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on all the parameters: \\\\( a, c, \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\). The trajectory of the function thus gets altered due to the compound effect of the transformations applied at different times, reflecting the influence of all parameters.",
