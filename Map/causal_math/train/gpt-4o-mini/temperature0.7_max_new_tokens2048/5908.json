  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyse how this function transforms under the operation of a complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} f(x) dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[wz](s) \\\\) is a Dirac delta at \\\\( s = -1 \\\\), can we determine both the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and the nature of intervention (the function \\\\( w(x) \\\\)) precisely?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function being a Dirac delta function at \\\\( s = -1 \\\\) uniquely corresponds to the frequency \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\), indicating that the original function was altered by multiplying with \\\\( w(x) = e^{-2ix} \\\\). Since this modification shifts the original \\\\( z(x) \\\\) frequency by exactly -2, we can precisely deduce both the original and the intervening function.",
