  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta \\\\\\\\ \\beta & \\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) are constants, on the state vector representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly whether the transformation \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both were applied at prior times?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the transformations' effects and the continuous influence of \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), similar states at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from different combinations of matrix applications and timings. This makes it impossible to uniquely identify the sequence of transformations applied.",
