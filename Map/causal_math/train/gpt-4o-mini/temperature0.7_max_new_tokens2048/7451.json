  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) according to the integral transformation \\\\( V(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)/RC} I(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where R and C are constants representing the resistance and capacitance, respectively.\n\nIf an intervention changes the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) midway at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to a different constant function, will the output voltage at any later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still depend on the original input current before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the change in the input current at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the output voltage at any time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still reflects the influence of the initial segment of \\\\( I(t) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) due to the integral's dependence over the entire interval from 0 to T. Each part of the input current contributes to the final output voltage.",
