  "Problem": "Assume the behavior of a complex system can be modeled by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\), where \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state in complex space, and A and C are constant complex matrices. Manipulations on the system are achieved by applying the transformation \\\\(h(z) = Dze^{Bt}\\\\), where D and B are also constant complex matrices.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can one infer the exact initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied, it's ambiguous if the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\) comes from \\\\(Ce^{AT}z_0\\\\) or \\\\(Ce^{AT}(Dz_0)\\\\). Disentangling the effect of D from the evolution due to A and C is non-trivial without additional information.",
