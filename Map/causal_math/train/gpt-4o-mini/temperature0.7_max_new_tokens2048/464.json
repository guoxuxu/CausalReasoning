  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing an oscillatory system. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output of the system at a certain endpoint, can we determine which transformations were used (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\) or both), only by analyzing the Fourier coefficients?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency components in the Fourier transform cannot specify whether transformations such as \\\\( G(z) \\\\) were applied, particularly due to the integrative nature of the Fourier transform, which compresses all time-domain information into the frequency domain, losing specific historical details about transformative interventions.",
