  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given, without applying any intervention, and then transformed via the Fourier transform, will the resulting transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) possess a delta function at the specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) inherently results in a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0) \\\\) centered at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\). This is because the Fourier transform of a pure complex exponential is a delta function representing a single frequency component.",
