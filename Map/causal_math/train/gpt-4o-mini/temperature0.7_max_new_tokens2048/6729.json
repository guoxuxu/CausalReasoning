  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant diffusivity. The rod undergoes a transformation due to a boundary condition change represented by \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) at one end, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a constant.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) is set at t = 0, and allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a later time T be equivalent to if \\\\( u(0,t) \\\\) wasn't changed?",
  "Explanation": "The new boundary condition modifies the initial state and influences how the heat diffuses along the rod. The exponential growth at one end results in a different temperature profile along the rod at any later time, compared to the default conditions.",
