  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\) is mapped using \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. We investigate the function under two scenarios: one driven by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\) with B being another complex constant, and another by a transformation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a third complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we infer the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, if we only know that the system evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not guarantee the retrieval of the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) was applied because the complex exponential transformation might have altered the initial state in a manner that is not reversible or discernible, especially if A and B do not commute.",
