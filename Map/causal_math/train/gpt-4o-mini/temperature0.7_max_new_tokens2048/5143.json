  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant. We investigate how the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where D is a complex constant, affects the system.\n\nIf an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) applies a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ft} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) (where F is a complex constant), will the resultant state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on C and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces additional influences through \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\), making the final state at T dependent on the history incorporated by D and the new dynamics introduced by F, along with the underlying evolution governed by C. The integration effects and exponential components skew the trajectory distinctly.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The evolution of the complex function z(t) is governed by the differential equation, which indicates that the parameter C directly influences the rate of change of z. The transformation T(z) depends on z(t) and is influenced by the parameter D, while the transformation U(z) also depends on z(t) and is influenced by the parameter F. The resultant state z(T) is determined by the transformations applied and the governing constant C, but it does not depend on D or F after the intervention at time t_1.",
