  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle moving along a line is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant coefficient. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) operated on the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and its impact over time t.\n\nKnowing the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to ascertain precisely which transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both), and at what times?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact transformations and their timing from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is generally infeasible. The position could be influenced in complex ways by different combinations and timings of applications of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\), making unique identification challenging.",
