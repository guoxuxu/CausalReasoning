  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a differential operator. We are interested in the behavior under the transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int e^{-tx} u(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), which integrates along the spatial variable x with a decay term dependent on time t.\n\nCan we fully reconstruct the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from the observed \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at time T after application of \\\\( G(u) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( G(u) \\\\) involves an integral transformation with a time-dependent decay factor, it results in loss of information about the initial spatial distribution. Without knowledge of how \\\\( G(u) \\\\) was applied, it is generally impossible to exactly recover \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\).",
