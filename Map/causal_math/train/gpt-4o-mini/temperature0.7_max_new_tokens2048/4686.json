  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over complex numbers \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its transformation with a complex integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\tau z(\\\\tau)} d\\\\tau\\\\). We are interested in the behavior of this transformation over time and how interventions might alter this behavior.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) be uniquely determined at t = 0 after observing its transformed state through \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at t = T without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of the integral transformation, which accumulates and alters the effect of the original function over time, it's impossible to uniquely deduce the initial state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) just from the knowledge of its state at a later time. The transformation adds differentials at each instant which cannot be distinctly reversed.",
