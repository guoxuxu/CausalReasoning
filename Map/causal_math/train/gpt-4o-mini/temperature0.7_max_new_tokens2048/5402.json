  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the heat diffusion over a plane is studied. The temperature distribution is represented by the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), which satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. The experiment manipulates this distribution via a sudden localized heating at point \\\\( x_0 \\\\), represented by the function \\\\( \\\\delta(x - x_0) \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_0 \\\\), can it be concluded if the localized heating at \\\\( x_0 \\\\) occurred or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the existence or absence of the localized heating, observing the temperature distribution at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) does not definitively indicate whether the point source heating was applied due to potential similarities in temperature distributions resulting from different initial conditions or other disturbances.",
