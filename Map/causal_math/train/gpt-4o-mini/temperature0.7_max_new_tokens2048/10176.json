  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where ω is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. A Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(ω) = \\\\int_{-∞}^{∞} z(t) e^{-iωt} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output after applying a damping intervention, can we determine whether the transformation included a damping factor or if the peak shift was due to another factor?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the exact nature of the intervention, it is unclear whether the peak shift in the Fourier transform was due to a damping factor or other modifications (such as additional frequency components or other transformations). The ambiguity in potential modifications precludes precise backward inference about the nature of the intervention.",
