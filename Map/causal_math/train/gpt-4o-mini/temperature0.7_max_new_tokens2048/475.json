  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario involving a sequence of functions \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and its transformations. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and a convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) are used. Analyze the impact of the convolution \\\\(y(t) = x(t) * h(t)\\\\) on the transformed signal over frequency domain \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nIf after performing the convolution but before the Fourier transform, an additional filtering operation defined by \\\\(g(t)\\\\) is applied on \\\\(y(t)\\\\), resulting in a new signal \\\\(z(t)\\\\), will the final Fourier transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) not depend on \\\\(h(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) will still depend on \\\\(h(t)\\\\), since the original convolution impact is present even though it is modified by the filtering with \\\\(g(t)\\\\). The Fourier transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) results from the initial transformations compounded by the new filtering, reflecting all the earlier operations.",
