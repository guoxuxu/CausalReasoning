  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a circular motion in the complex plane. We then examine the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\), an intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{-i\\pi}z \\\\) is applied, will this affect the state at a later time \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\) compared to just evolving under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and not considering \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) effectively introduces a phase shift which, combined with the initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), alters the periodic trajectory differently compared to only evolving under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). This leads to a change in both the phase and position at \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\).",
