  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the equation \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where x and y are real variables, and i is the imaginary unit. This system is subjected to the transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of the system is analyzed in a scenario where transformations are applied and the system evolves over time.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of another function \\\\( H(z) = e^{Mz} \\\\) (where M is another constant complex matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the system's state at T > t_1 depend solely on the matrix K and not on the matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( H(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory initiated by \\\\( G(z) \\\\), and thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) also depends on M. The interactions between the transformations due to K and M are complex and not merely additive, leading to a dependency on both.",
