  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. Examine the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling and potentially rotating \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The resulting trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) diverges from the original path due to the exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), which can introduce both an amplitude change and a phase rotation depending on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
