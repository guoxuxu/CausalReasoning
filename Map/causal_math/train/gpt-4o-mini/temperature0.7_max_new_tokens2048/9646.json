  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nCan the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 be precisely determined from the observed \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) affects the initial state in a way that cannot be simply inverted without knowing the transformation details. The complex rotation could have modified the initial state's nature, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\( x_0 \\) without this information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M influences the vector x, which in turn determines the state x(t) at time t. The function f(x) transforms x but also influences x(t) and the original vector x_0 at time t = 0. The state x(0) at time t = 0 leads to the state x(t) at time t, and x(t) can be used to infer x_0.",
