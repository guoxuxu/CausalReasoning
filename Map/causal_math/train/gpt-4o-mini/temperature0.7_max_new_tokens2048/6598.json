  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a system characterized by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable. Then, an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T[x](t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(u) e^{-atu} du \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the output from the system after applying both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\), recovering the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solely from the transformed output is generally indeterminate because the integral transformation could introduce attenuations, phase shifts, or other modifications that mask the original input characteristics.",
