  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to the variable z in the complex plane over time t, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-iz} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the output of \\\\( f \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the state further, interacting complexly with \\\\( g(z) \\\\). For example, applying \\\\( h \\\\) after \\\\( g \\\\) could partially or fully undo or amplify the effect of \\\\( g \\\\), and the result of \\\\( f \\\\) will encompass effects of both transformations.",
