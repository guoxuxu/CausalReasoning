  "Problem": "In the context of function analysis, consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial conditions and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. The effect of varying \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nCan the original matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) be uniquely determined from the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) assuming initial conditions \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are unknown?",
  "Explanation": "The initial conditions \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) introduce unknown scaling and shifting factors in each exponential term, making it impossible to uniquely resolve \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alone. Since different combinations of \\\\( A, B, x, \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) could yield similar Fourier transforms, precise retrieval of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) is not feasible without more information.",
