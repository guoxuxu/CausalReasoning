  "Problem": "Evaluate the causality in a system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze this under the operation of the integral transformation represented by \\(\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt\\), where \\(D\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the initial vector \\(z_0\\) at t = 0 be deduced from observing \\(z(t)\\) at t = T if it's unknown whether \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\), the resultant \\(z(T)\\) could be due to diverse initial modifications by \\(D\\). The transformation introduces an element of uncertainty in deducing \\(z_0\\) as the influence of \\(D\\) might conceal the effects solely due to \\(C\\).",
