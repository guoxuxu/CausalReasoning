  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, D are constants. The system is subjected to a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing a frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By, \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) changes the initial conditions by rotating the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane, leading to an evolution path distinct from that of the unaltered initial condition. This modification results in a different state at time T due to the influence of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) on the trajectory.",
