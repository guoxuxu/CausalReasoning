  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We analyze how transformations by the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, affect the solution over time.\n\nIf during the evolution, at some specified time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), with a different complex constant \\\\( q \\\\), is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) introduces a new integral effect, which along with the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\}, alters the subsequent evolution of the function. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both transformations and cannot be considered independent of either.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The function z(t) evolves over time according to the differential equation, which is influenced by the frequency ω, leading to changes in z(t) over time. The integral operator ℒ transforms z(t), producing a new function that also evolves independently. Applying the transformation ℳ at a specified time t1 intervenes in the evolution of z(t) and introduces a different dynamics influenced by q. The endpoint z(T) for T > t1 is affected by both transformations, indicating a dependency on the initial transformation by ℒ.",
