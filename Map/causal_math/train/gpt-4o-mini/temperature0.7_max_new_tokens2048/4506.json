  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\) where \\( f(t) \\) is a time-dependent function and \\( s \\) is a complex variable. We analyze the causal influence of multiplying \\( f(t) \\) by a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nBased on the transformed function \\( F'(s) \\), can you determine whether the original function \\( f(t) \\) was multiplied by a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) without knowing \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "If only \\( F'(s) \\) is known, the original \\( \\omega \\) value used in the exponential multiplication cannot be uniquely determined without additional information. Multiple values of \\( \\omega \\) could yield similar alterations in \\( F'(s) \\).",
