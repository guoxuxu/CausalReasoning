  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the system's change under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, affecting the resultant state at t = T. The final state hence depends on the interactions and relative magnitudes of P, Q, and R through compounded exponential transformations, moving the system's trajectory away from that dictated solely by P.",
