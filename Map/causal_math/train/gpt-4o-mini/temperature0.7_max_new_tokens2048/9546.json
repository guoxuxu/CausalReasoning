  "Problem": "We examine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a second-order differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{z} = -\\\\omega^2 z + \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) represents an external driving force. We explore the impacts of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the system.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) remains ambiguous due to the presence of the exponential phase factor introduced by the transformation. This factor alters both amplitude and phase, obfuscating the initial condition.",
