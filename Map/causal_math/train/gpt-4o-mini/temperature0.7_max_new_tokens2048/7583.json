  "Problem": "Suppose we analyze the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}x + \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}Bu(s) \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. This system reflects the solution to a linear time-invariant dynamic system with input.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) such that \\\\( u(t) \\\\) changes course, will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the total history of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from 0 to T, including both before and after the intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The integral term accumulates effects of \\\\( u(s) \\\\) over the entire interval [0, T], making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a cumulative outcome of all control inputs.",
