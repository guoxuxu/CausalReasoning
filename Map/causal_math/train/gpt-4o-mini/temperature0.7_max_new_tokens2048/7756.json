  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. Suppose an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt'} z(t') dt' \\\\) is applied, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we uniquely identify whether transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) or \\\\( U(z) \\\\) or both were used based solely on the output state?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention scenarios can lead to similar or indistinguishable end states due to overlapping effects and non-unique solutions generated by the matrix exponentials. Deciphering exact interventions strictly from end states is typically unfeasible without additional system history.",
