  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate changes in the function given by the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\), applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function in the Laplace domain, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), can we recover the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) uniquely without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion of the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) uniquely yields the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). The correspondence is direct and unambiguous in this specific context.",
