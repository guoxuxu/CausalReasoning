  "Problem": "Consider a complex function analysis where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied to a function in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system's dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced, as the phase shift introduced could correspond to multiple potential starting points depending on the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
