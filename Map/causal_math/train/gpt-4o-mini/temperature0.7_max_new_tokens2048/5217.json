  "Problem": "Consider the transfer function of a linear system represented by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We investigate the system's response to complex inputs and the effect of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the input to the system \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is a sine wave, will the output at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) solely depend on the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) without any additional transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The system's output in response to a sinusoidal input is defined entirely by its transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), representing the system's inherent linear response without further transformation. Frequency analysis directly relates to characterizing such systems.",
