  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat distribution described by \\\\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\\\), a predefined function, and the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega x}h(x) dx \\\\) on this distribution.\n\nKnowing the temperature distribution at a later time t > 0, \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The forward evolution of the heat equation is diffusive, which tends to smooth and disperse the initial temperature profile over time. This dispersion makes it inherently challenging to reverse engineer the original precise profile \\\\( h(x) \\\\) from the diffused state at a later time.",
