  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\(\\int_0^t K(t-u) x(u) du = y(t)\\), where \\(K(s)\\) is a complex kernel function and \\(x(t)\\) is the input function. We study the changes in the output \\( y(t) \\) under the transformations initiated by different input functions such as \\( g(x) = x + Ae^{-\\lambda t} \\) for some constant matrix \\( A \\) and scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( x_0(t) \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( y(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( g(x) \\), any changes introduced by the transformation \\( Ae^{-\\lambda t} \\) make it challenging to accurately reconstruct \\( x_0(t) \\) purely from \\( y(t) \\) at T, since multiple input functions could lead to similar outputs due to the convolution properties of integral transformations.",
