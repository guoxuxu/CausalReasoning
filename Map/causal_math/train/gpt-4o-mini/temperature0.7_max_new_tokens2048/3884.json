  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar. The system's evolution is assessed with and without the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real scalar.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various initial conditions and interventions due to the superposition principle in complex functions. The phase changes induced by \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) may cause similar final states under different scenarios, obscuring which specific transformations were applied.",
