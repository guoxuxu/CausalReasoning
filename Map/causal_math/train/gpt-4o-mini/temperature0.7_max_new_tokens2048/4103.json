  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix and z a complex variable. We examine how the integral transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw\\\\) influences behavior over the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a specific point, such as modifying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g'(z) = \\\\int_0^z (f(w) + Cdw) \\\\), where C is another complex constant, will the final expression of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) for any z be independent of the original A in \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds complexity through an additional constant C, but the original matrix A still influences the outcome through the original part of the integral. Both the initial matrix A and the added constant C will determine the new behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), making the outcome dependent on both parameters.",
