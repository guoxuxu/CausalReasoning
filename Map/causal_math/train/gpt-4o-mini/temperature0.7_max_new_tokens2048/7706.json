  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the behavior when a transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k \\\\) being a constant and \\\\( x \\\\) the spatial variable.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) was applied, it is challenging to reverse-engineer the initial condition due to possible modifications in the frequency components of \\\\( u \\\\), which are affected differently by \\\\( L \\\\).",
