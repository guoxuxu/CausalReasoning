  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), and A and B are scalar constants. We explore causal relationships under the Fourier transform defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\), can we uniquely determine the constants A and B without knowing the initial conditions of \\\\(x(0)\\\\) and \\\\(y(0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\), the relationship between frequency components and decay or growth rates (A and B) can be inferred, but specific values of A and B cannot be uniquely determined without additional information on initial conditions, as these affect the amplitude and phase in the Fourier transform.",
