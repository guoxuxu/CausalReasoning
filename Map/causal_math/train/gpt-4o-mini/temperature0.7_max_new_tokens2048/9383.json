  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the application of the Laplace transform on this function and its inverse to determine system behavior over time.\n\nIf the transformation defined by \\\\( w(t) = te^{at} \\\\) (introducing a multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\)) is applied to the function and then it undergoes a Laplace transform, will the effect on the Laplace domain depend only on the original \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\\\( t \\\\) alters the Laplace transform from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2} \\\\), clearly showing a dependency not only on \\\\( a \\\\) but also the nature of the intervention (multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\)).",
