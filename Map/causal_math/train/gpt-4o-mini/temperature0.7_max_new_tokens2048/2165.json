  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation applied on this function is given by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a fixed positive integer. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original function without further intervention, will the outcome at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved to t = T under just the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) fundamentally modifies the function. Specifically, transforming \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\) by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) leads to \\\\( (e^{iωt})^n = e^{inωt} \\\\), which alters the frequency of oscillation. Therefore, the behavior at time T will differ from merely evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the transformation, due to the change in frequency.",
