  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) which describes a point moving on the unit circle in the complex plane over time t. We explore the response of the system under an integral transformation described by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the outcome of the function after integration, \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The integrated function \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) captures the cumulative effect of the circular motion over time, but it loses information about the specific instance at t = 0. Different initial functions might integrate to the same or a similar outcome, particularly given transformations involving periodic or cyclic elements.",
