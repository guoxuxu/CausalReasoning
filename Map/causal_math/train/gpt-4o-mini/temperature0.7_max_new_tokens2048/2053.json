  "Problem": "Examine the application of Laplace transforms in a control system where an input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( L(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\). The system's response \\\\( X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) represents the complex frequency domain, is dictated by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The analysis focuses on the behavior of the system under different transformations and interventions.\n\nAssuming the Laplace transform of the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and applied to a system with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the system's output response \\\\( X(s) \\\\) in the frequency domain be defined exclusively by \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any interference or additional transformations, the output response \\\\( X(s) = H(s) U(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain is determined entirely by the Laplace transform of the input and the system's transfer function, as dictated by the convolution theorem and the properties of linear time-invariant systems.",
