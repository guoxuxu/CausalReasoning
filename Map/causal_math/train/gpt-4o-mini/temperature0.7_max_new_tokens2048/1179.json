  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving via the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Qz \\\\), with Q being a complex constant. Analysis includes the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\), where P is also a complex constant, representing an operational transformation.\n\nAssuming a new intervention \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) where R is a complex constant is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T>t_1 solely depend on Q and not on P or R?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) means the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the transformations due to P and R as well as the inherent evolution due to Q. The interplay between these complex exponentials means all will impact the eventual state at T.",
