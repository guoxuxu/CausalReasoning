  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the impact of the Fourier Transform and its inverse defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( F^{-1}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier Transformed state \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we accurately infer the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if and when transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by the Fourier Transform may alter fundamental attributes of the system, such as phase and amplitude in ways that are non-reversible without additional information on when and how transformations took place because they fundamentally change the depiction of the system in frequency space versus time space.",
