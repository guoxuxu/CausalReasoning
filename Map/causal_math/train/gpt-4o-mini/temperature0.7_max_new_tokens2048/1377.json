  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation matrix T, where \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) changes the basis of the solution and subsequently applying the inverse transformation \\\\( T^{-1}y = x \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( x \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the equation \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( y \\\\) in the new basis at the end still satisfy \\\\( Ay = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) changes the basis of \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( y \\\\). The system in the new basis is \\\\( AT^{-1}y = b \\\\), not \\\\( Ay = b \\\\). Without converting back, the system equation does not hold as directly transformed.",
