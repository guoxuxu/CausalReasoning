  "Problem": "Analyze a network system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region, where u represents potential at any point. An external field represented by the function \\\\( v(x, y, z) = e^{Ax + By + Cz} \\\\) (A, B, C are constants) is applied to the region at time t = 0.\n\nKnowing the potential distribution \\\\( u(x, y, z, T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to uniquely determine which external fields (\\\\( v(x, y, z) \\\\), \\\\( w(x, y, z) \\\\), or both) were applied throughout the evolution up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The specific effects of the external fields \\\\( v \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) can result in similar potential distributions under certain conditions, such as similar parameters or compensating effects. Because multiple configurations of external fields might yield the same or similar outcomes, it is impossible to uniquely decode the history of interventions from the final state alone.",
