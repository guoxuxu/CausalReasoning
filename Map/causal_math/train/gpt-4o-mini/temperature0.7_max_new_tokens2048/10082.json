  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\), where L is inductance, R is resistance and E(t) represents a time-dependent electromotive force. Further, suppose that an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by multiplying the current amplitude by a scalar \\\\( k \\\\) is applied, and we explore how this affects the response of the system over time t.\n\nGiven the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the exact initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the operator \\\\( T \\\\) was applied (i.e., the modification by \\\\( k \\\\)), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\). The current at any time could have been altered by the scalar multiplication, making exact back-calculation to \\\\( I_0 \\\\) uncertain.",
