  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane over time t. Analyze the transformations applied by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and the implications of these transformations over time.\n\nGiven the observed final state \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) or the intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) was applied, assuming starting at \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed final state \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) corresponds to various possible transformations and interventions. Both the squaring and cubing of the angle in complex exponentials can be formatted over different durations to result in the same final state observed, making it impossible to uniquely determine which transformation was used solely based on the observed endpoint.",
