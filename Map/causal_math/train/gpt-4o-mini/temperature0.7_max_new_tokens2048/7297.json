  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. These equations describe the dynamics of two separate systems. We explore the effect of applying the integral transform \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)C} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on these systems.\n\nIf \\\\( T[f] \\\\) is applied separately to the solutions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from t = 0, will the resultant function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after transformation be the representation of \\\\( x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the original differential systems without any T applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) changes the evolution of each component, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), by integrating past values in a manner weighted by the matrix exponential term \\\\( e^{-(t-\\\\tau)C} \\\\). This affects each trajectory differently based on how C interacts with A and B, thus altering the resultant complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
