  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nIf \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) as a change of basis, and then we solve the eigenvalue problem for \\\\( A \\\\) without altering \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( P \\\\), will \\\\( v(t) \\\\) still be an eigenvector of \\\\( A \\\\) under this new basis?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) merely represents a change of basis and does not alter the inherent properties of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) or its eigenvectors. The transformed vector will still align with the eigenspace of \\\\( A \\\\), just expressed in a different basis.",
