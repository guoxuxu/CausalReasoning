  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). The impact of a Fourier transform on the wave function is studied to see how it affects the system's evolution.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi)(k, t = 0)\\\\) is applied to the wave function at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = 0)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the Schrödinger equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = 0)\\\\) and evolving it in the momentum space does not change the physical content of the wave function. Since Fourier transform is invertible and due to the linearity and unitarity of the Schrödinger equation, the evolved wave function in position space at time T will be equivalent to that obtained from direct evolution of the initial wave function in position space.",
