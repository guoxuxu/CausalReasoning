  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine the effects of a linear fractional transformation \\\\( L(z) = \\\\frac{cz + d}{bz + e} \\\\), with constants \\\\( b, c, d, e \\\\) on the transformed function.\n\nIf we apply an intervening transformation \\\\( I(z) = pz + q \\\\) (where \\\\( p, q \\\\) are constants) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final output at time \\\\( T \\\\) depend only on the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and not on the transformations \\\\( L(z) \\\\) or \\\\( I(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory and the final form that the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) would take. As a result, the final state of the system at time \\\\( T \\\\) is influenced by \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( I(z) \\\\), and their interaction with \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
