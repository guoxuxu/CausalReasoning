  "Problem": "A complex function is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = cz + d \\\\) over time t, where c and d are complex constants.\n\nCan we determine exactly what transformations were applied (either \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on knowing the outcome \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 could be influenced by either transformation alone or both in conjunction, and these transformations could theoretically yield the same final state from different initial conditions and parameters due to their linear nature. Determining the exact sequence or type of interventions requires additional information beyond the final state.",
