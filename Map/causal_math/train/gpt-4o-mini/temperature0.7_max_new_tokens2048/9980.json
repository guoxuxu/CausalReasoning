  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) that represents a complex function on the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). For a complex domain transformation defined by \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\), we investigate how this affects the mapping of points over an interval from x = 0 to x = 2\\\\pi.\n\nGiven the final point on the w-plane at x = 2\\\\pi, can we distinctly identify if the path followed was only due to \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\) or if the intervention \\\\( v(z) = z^3 \\\\) at x = \\\\pi/2 was also applied?",
  "Explanation": "At x = 2\\\\pi, both transformations lead back to 1 on the unit circle (since \\\\( e^{4\\\\pi i} = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{6\\\\pi i} = 1 \\\\)), making it indistinguishable at the endpoint whether an intervention occurred solely based on the endpoint value. Multiple paths might lead to the same output, all confined to the unit circle.",
