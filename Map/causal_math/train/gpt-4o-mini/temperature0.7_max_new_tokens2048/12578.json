  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The influence of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, is analyzed over time. This transformation modifies the trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( M(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the original function parameters and not on the transformations \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), in addition to the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Since these transformations add shifts and scale factors in the complex domain, they collaboratively modify the trajectory and final state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
