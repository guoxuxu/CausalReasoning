  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar. The system's evolution is assessed with and without the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real scalar.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on \\\\( A \\\\), but also on \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). The phase shifts introduced by \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) can interact with the ongoing evolution due to \\\\( A \\\\), thus affecting the system to arrive at a new endpoint.",
