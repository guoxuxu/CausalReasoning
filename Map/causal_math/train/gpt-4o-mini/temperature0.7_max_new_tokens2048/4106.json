  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We examine the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, and given the potential complex transformations involved, it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T, particularly if A, B, and C do not commute.",
