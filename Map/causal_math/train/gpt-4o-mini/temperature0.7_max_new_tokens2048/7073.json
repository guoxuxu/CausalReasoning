  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, defined as \\\\( Lf = \\\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\\\. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is used to analyze the system.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\) is then computed, will the transformed function's behavior in the Fourier space represent the same differential property as applying the Fourier transform first and then computing its differential effect?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then taking the Fourier transform converts the double differentiation in real space into a multiplication in the Fourier space by \\\\( -k^2 \\\\), which is equivalent to first transforming \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then applying the differential operation in the Fourier space.",
