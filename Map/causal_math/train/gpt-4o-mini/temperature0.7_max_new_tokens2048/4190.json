  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta \\\\\\\\ \\beta & \\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) are constants, on the state vector representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from which \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolved be uniquely determined by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied, the deducing of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is ambiguous due to the potential alteration by \\\\( M \\\\). The application of \\\\( M \\\\) could modify \\\\( z(0) \\\\), shifting phases and/or scales, thereby blending with changes from \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), and causing multiple possibilities for \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
