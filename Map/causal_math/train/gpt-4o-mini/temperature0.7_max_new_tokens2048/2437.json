  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by \\( Ax = b \\), where A is a non-singular matrix. An operator \\( T \\) defined by \\( T(x) = Ux \\) (where \\( U \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied, modifying the vector \\( x \\) in the space.\n\nIf \\( T(x) \\) is applied altering the initial vector \\( x_0 \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), and \\( x \\) evolves under \\( Ax = b \\) to \\( t = T \\) without further modifications, will \\( x(T) \\) represent the solution to \\( Ax = b \\) as if \\( T \\) were never applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T \\) to \\( x_0 \\) modifies the initial condition to \\( Ux_0 \\). Since the transformation by \\( U \\) changes the vector, and \\( A(Ux_0) = b \\) only if \\( U \\) is the inverse of \\( A \\), in general, the solution at \\( t = T \\) does not satisfy \\( Ax = b \\) unless \\( AUx_0 = b \\), which is generally not the case.",
