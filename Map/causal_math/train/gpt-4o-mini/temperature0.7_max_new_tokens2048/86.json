  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) on the system and manipulating the transformed function.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) using the Fourier transform without knowing how the system was manipulated during [0,T]?",
  "Explanation": "If the system was manipulated or if there were any unknown interventions (such as changes in wave speed or additional forces), these factors could affect the evolution in a way that isn't recovered simply by observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) and applying a Fourier transform, due to potential non-linear interventions or changes in system parameters.",
