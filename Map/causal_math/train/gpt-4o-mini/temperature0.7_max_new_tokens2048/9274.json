  "Problem": "Imagine a system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time. We evaluate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nHaving observed z(T) for some T, can we determine the initial condition z(0) and the specifics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied (the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) solely based on this final observation?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing z(T) without additional context does not uniquely specify z(0) or the parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) due to the exponential nature of the transformation. Multiple combinations of initial conditions and scaling parameters can lead to the same result, particularly since \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can interact to produce complex behaviors.",
