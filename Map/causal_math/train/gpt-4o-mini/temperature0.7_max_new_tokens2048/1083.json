  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\. Over time, the function describes a circular trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nSuppose at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a scaling operation defined by a constant positive real number \\\\( s \\\\) modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = se^{iAt}x \\\\. For \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\. will the magnitude of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) now depend only on the scaling factor \\\\( s \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or the initial \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the scaling factor \\\\( s \\\\) modifies the magnitude directly and is a predominant factor, the resulting magnitude of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still depends on the initial magnitude of \\\\( x \\\\. The scaling does not negate the inherent properties of \\\\( x \\\\) such as its initial magnitude.",
