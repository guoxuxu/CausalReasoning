  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x, y, t) + iv(x, y, t) \\\\), a complex-valued function of two spatial variables and time, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with another function, say \\\\( w(x, y, t) = k(x, y)z \\\\) where k(x, y) is another complex function, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by the initial wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( w(x, y, t) \\\\) introduces another complexity to the system, asserting that influences from function k(x, y) also play a crucial role in shaping the final state at time T, alongside the original wave equation.",
