  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\), where k is a complex constant, and its response to the Laplace transform deformations described by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nCan we precisely identify the value of the parameter k by observing \\\\( L(z) \\\\) after the Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the form of \\\\( L(z) \\\\) which is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-ik} \\\\), the parameter k can be uniquely determined as it directly influences the pole of the transformed function. The inverse relation between k and the transformation permits explicit recovery of k.",
