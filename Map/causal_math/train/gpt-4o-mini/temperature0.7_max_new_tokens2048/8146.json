  "Problem": "Consider a linear system subject to the equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where D is a constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of applying the transformation \\( T(x) = Lx \\) where \\( L \\) is a linear map represented by a constant matrix, and examining the behavior over a duration \\( t \\).\n\nIs it feasible to reconstruct the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( T(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking the knowledge whether \\( T(x) \\) was applied initially, and assuming \\( L \\) may not be the identity matrix or may alter the state significantly, it becomes impossible to uniquely determine \\( x_0 \\) due to the potential alteration by \\( L \\).",
