  "Problem": "Consider a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolving according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in a potential V(x). Let an operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) be applied to \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\), transforming it to \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0. We analyze how this operation impacts the evolution of the wave function.\n\nCan we deduce the exact original wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation by \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) was applied, it's impossible to uniquely determine the original state \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) from the observed \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\). The application of \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) could have altered the initial conditions in a critical way.",
