  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of an external force applied to a mechanical system obeying the second order differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The system is subject to an impulse response represented as a transformation \\\\(g(x) = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are matrices and u denotes the control input.\n\nGiven the observation of state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) before any transformation by \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if and how \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied, it's impossible to ascertain the original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) solely based on the later observation. The transformation may have altered the initial conditions in a way that is untraceable without additional information about B and u.",
