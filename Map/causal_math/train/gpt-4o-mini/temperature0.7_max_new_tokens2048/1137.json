  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nIf the function is transformed by the Fourier transform without any modifications, will the transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) \\\\) exhibit a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\) essentially measures the presence of frequencies in the function. Since \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\) is a pure frequency component corresponding to \\\\( k = 1 \\\\), its Fourier transform results in a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\), indicating the exclusive presence of this frequency with no others.",
