  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagation described by the second order partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial t^2 = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) with a perturbation function \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is applied to an initial wave profile \\\\(u_0\\\\) at time t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under the wave equation without further intervention, will the wave profile \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u_0\\\\) were evolved directly for time T under the original wave equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial conditions of the wave equation. The exponential growth term \\\\(e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) will amplify the wave differently than under normal conditions, leading to a different wave profile at time T.",
