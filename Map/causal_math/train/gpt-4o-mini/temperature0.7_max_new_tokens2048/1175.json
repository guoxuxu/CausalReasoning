  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nIf an external modification \\\\( S(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (with C being another constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( S(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) dependent not only on A but also on B and C. The interaction of these exponential terms means that the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) is influenced by all three parameters.",
