  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real number representing time. We are analyzing how the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t}dt \\\\) affects our understanding of the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) modifying the function to \\\\( y(t) = e^{-t}e^{it} \\\\), will the Fourier Transform \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( y(t) \\\\) differ from \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor transforms the function into a decaying exponential combined with a complex exponential, affecting the Fourier Transform significantly. The new transform will have its peak shifted and broadened, reflecting the decay introduced by \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\).",
