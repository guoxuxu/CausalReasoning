  "Problem": "Considering a signal processing scenario where a continuous-time signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), and then a filter characterized by a function \\( H(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\).\n\nIf a signal \\( x(t) \\) is transformed to \\( X(f) \\) and then filtered by \\( H(f) \\) without any modification to \\( H(f) \\), will the output signal \\( y(t) \\), obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of \\( Y(f) = H(f)X(f) \\), reflect the characteristics imposed by \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output signal \\( y(t) \\) will indeed reflect the characteristics of \\( H(f) \\), as it directly modifies \\( X(f) \\) in the frequency domain, effectively shaping the output \\( y(t) \\) based on \\( H(f)'s \\) properties, like bandwidth or cut-off frequencies.",
