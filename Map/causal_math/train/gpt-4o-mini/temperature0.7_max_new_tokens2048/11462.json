  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function scenario where the initial function is \\\\( z(t) = C t^2 + iD \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) being real numbers. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, with A being a real constant.\n\nCan the initial state of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be exactly deduced from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation factors \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) complicate back-calculating to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately. The exponential influence is essential information missing, making it impossible to reverse the process particularly.",
