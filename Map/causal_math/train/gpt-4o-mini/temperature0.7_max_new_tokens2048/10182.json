  "Problem": "Consider the impact of different transform kernels in an integral transformation on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Define transform kernels \\\\( K(t, x) = e^{At} \\\\) and intervention kernels \\\\( L(t, x) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, on the analysis of the function over time.\n\nKnowing the transformed function at t = T, can we uniquely determine \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether kernel \\\\( K \\\\) or any other kernel was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the kernel used (if any), it is impossible to reverse the transformation uniquely, especially if the kernels do not commute or if their effects are not easily separable.",
