  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The response of the system to inputs is investigated under the influence of a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), with K being another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to accurately backtrack to the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at the onset?",
  "Explanation": "Without certain knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), the initial state could include modifications incurred by \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\). Since exponential matrices related to K could have adjusted the direction or magnitude of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), deducing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without this information results in ambiguities and potential errors.",
