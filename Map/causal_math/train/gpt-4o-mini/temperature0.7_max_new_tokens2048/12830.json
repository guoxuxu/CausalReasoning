  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the z-plane, where z is a complex number, and is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We evaluate the effects of a transformation involving a linear operator T applied to the function, where \\\\( T(f(z)) = f'(z) \\\\), the derivative of the function.\n\nIf at a specific point z = b, an intervention alters the function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^3} \\\\), and the transformation T is still applied, will the results merely be dependent on the initial transformation T and not the new function g at any point z = c (for \\(c \\neq b\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing the original function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^3} \\\\) at z = b alters the behavior of the system globally, affecting points beyond z = b. The derivative transformation T applied thereafter affects this new function, yielding different results than just the application of T on \\\\( f(z) \\\\), thus the dependency exists both on the new function and the transformation.",
