  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{gz} \\\\) where g is a complex constant. This function is used to transform the path of integration in the complex plane for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_C e^{z^2} dz \\\\), where C is initially the real axis from -∞ to +∞.\n\nIf the path C is transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to a new path \\\\( C' \\\\), and then the integral \\\\( I \\\\) is computed along \\\\( C' \\\\) without any further transformation, does the integral change in value?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the path of integration in the complex plane can alter the value of the integral significantly, depending on how the new path \\\\( C' \\\\) relates to the singularities and essential nature of the function \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\). A change in path can enclose different residues or avoid essential singularities, leading to a different result for the integral.",
