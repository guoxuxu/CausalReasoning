  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We study the implications of modifying this integral using a linear transformation of the variable x given by the function \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf at some x = t, an intervention modifies x to \\\\( h(x) = cx + d \\\\) (c and d are constants), then will \\\\( F(cx + d) \\\\) depend only on the original transformation properties a and b?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\( h(x) = cx + d \\\\) as an intervention alters the basis of calculation for the transform \\\\( F \\\\). Thus, \\\\( F(cx + d) \\\\) will depend on the new constants c and d as well as the original a and b, reflecting changes from both transformations.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transform F(x) is influenced by changes to the variable x through linear transformations g(x) and h(x), which modify the input to the integral. Specifically, the transformation g(x) modifies x to x itself, while h(x) further modifies it to cx + d. Therefore, F(cx + d) depends on how h(x) alters x, which may or may not relate to the properties of the original transformation defined by a and b.",
