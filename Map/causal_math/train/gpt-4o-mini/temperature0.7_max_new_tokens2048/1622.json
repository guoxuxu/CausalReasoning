  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) over time is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the integral transformation output \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) for all time points without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform can be used to reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\\\) precisely, as long as the transform exists and is unique, which is true for the exponential function \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\).",
