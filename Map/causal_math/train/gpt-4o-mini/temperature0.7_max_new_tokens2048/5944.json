  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we conclusively determine what transformations were applied (either \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(R(z)\\\\), both, or in what sequence) based solely on knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of initial and intermediate transformations involving \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\), potentially in different sequences. The non-commutative nature of matrix multiplication (especially in complex domains) introduces additional complexity, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack and define the specific sequence or types of applied transformations.",
