  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented in matrix form as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a invertible matrix. We explore the effects of applying a matrix transformation \\\\(T = e^{Mt}\\\\) to the vector \\\\(b\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(t\\\\) is a time variable.\n\nCan we ascertain the original vector \\\\(b\\\\) after solving the system for \\\\(x\\\\) when observing \\\\(Ax = e^{Mt}b\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), without knowing \\\\(T\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) applied to \\\\(b\\\\), it is not possible to definitively trace back to the original vector \\\\(b\\\\) solely from the solution \\\\(x\\\\), as the transformation \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) could have modified \\\\(b\\\\) in any number of ways contingent on the nature of \\\\(M\\\\).",
