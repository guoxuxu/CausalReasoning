  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of this function is studied under a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different intervals of time t.\n\nKnowing the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > 0, can we determine if the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to distinguish if the state \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{2i\\\\omega T} \\\\) (corresponding to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) application) resulted from the original or doubly frequent function, as both are feasible outcomes depending on whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied.",
