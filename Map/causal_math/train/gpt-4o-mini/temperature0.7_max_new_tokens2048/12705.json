  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u + \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{t} e^{-\\\\alpha(t-s)}u(s)ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) are constants. The behavior of the system is analyzed when subject to transformations using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at T, can we deduce the exact form of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) without knowing if a Laplace transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by Laplace may alter the initial conditions in a non-reversible way, especially given the integral component and the decay factor in the differential equation. Without knowing the initial transformation, the original form of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
