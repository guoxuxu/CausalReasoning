  "Problem": "In the context of a heat conduction problem, assume a rod along the x-axis where the temperature distribution at time t is given by the function \\( u(x,t) \\), which satisfies the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\). We consider an integral transformation \\( f(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-sx}u(x,0) \\, dx \\) (Fourier Transform) and study its impact on the solution when applied initially.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial temperature distribution \\( u(x,0) \\) precisely after observing \\( u(x,T) \\) at time T without knowing whether \\( f(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier Transform is bijective on the function space under suitable conditions, the original temperature distribution \\( u(x,0) \\) can be precisely determined by applying the inverse Fourier Transform to \\( f(u) \\) computed from \\( u(x,T) \\), regardless of the initial application of \\( f(u) \\).",
