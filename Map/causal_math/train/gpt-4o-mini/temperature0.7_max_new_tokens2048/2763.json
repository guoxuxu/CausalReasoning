  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is then transformed using a Fourier Transform to analyze its frequency components over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified by a scaling factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) resulting in \\\\( z(t) = \\alpha e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), does its Fourier Transform still indicate the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the function by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) does not alter the frequency content; it only changes the amplitude of the Fourier Transform. The frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remains clearly indicated by the position of the delta peak, thus the effect still reliably reveals the original cause even after intervention.",
