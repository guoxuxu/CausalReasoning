  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing the motion of a particle in a plane, influenced by the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nCan we determine the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined because the rotation could have placed multiple potential initial points to the same endpoint.",
