  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( w(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and subsequently transformed by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of this system under various transformations and interventions.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( w(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, determining the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is problematic as the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) significantly alters the trajectory. Any observed result could originate from various possible initial states due to the non-linear transformation.",
