  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\alpha s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition before the evolution by adding a scaled integral transform effect, which affects both the amplitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The resulting state at T significantly differs because the initial addition via \\\\( g(z) \\\\) does not evolve as merely \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\).",
