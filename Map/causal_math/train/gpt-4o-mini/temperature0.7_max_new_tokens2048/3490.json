  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\mu |z|^2z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real frequency parameter, and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is a nonlinear growth rate parameter. Now, let's the consider the Fourier transform of the solution \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the state at time t = T, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(T)\\\\}\\\\), can we infer the exact initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform at time T provides information primarily about the frequency content of the state at that time but does not uniquely specify the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) due to potential loss of information through evolution, especially given the nonlinear term \\\\(|z|^2z\\\\), which can lead to diverse behaviors from similar initial conditions.",
