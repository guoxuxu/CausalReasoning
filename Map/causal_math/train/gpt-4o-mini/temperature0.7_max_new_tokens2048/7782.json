  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a user-controlled input and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a fixed angular frequency. The evolution of the system is studied through the application of the Laplace Transform, transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nBased on the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we precisely deduce the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without knowing its relation to the overall system behavior especially the impact of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex exponential \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) contributes additional components to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) that confound the ability to back-solve uniquely for \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without additional assumptions or information. Both components are intertwined in the Laplace domain.",
