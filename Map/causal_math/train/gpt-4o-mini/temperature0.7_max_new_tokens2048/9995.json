  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant thermal diffusivity. An external heat source modifies this equation by a term \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\), making it \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + v(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the thermal diffusivity from k to a new constant \\\\( k' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final temperature distribution at time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still be affected by the initial diffusivity k?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of thermal diffusivity part-way through the system's evolution impacts the way heat diffuses through the rod, but the system’s state up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is influenced by the original diffusivity k, and hence the final state at time T will still reflect the effects of both k and \\\\( k' \\\\).",
