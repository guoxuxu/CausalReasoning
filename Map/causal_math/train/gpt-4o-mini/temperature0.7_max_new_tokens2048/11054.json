  "Problem": "We consider a complex function transformation in the context of an integral transformation. The initial function is \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an original real-valued function. We analyze applying a transformation \\\\( h(t) = k(t) * f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( * \\\\) denotes convolution with a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without knowing whether the convolution with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( k(t) \\\\), the resultant function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) may reflect various original functions altered by different kernels. The integral transform with convolution makes it challenging to uniquely deduce \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
