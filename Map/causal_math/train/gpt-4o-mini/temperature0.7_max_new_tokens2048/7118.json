  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) represent a transfer function in the Laplace transform domain, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We consider the impact of applying a sinusoidal input \\\\( x(t) = \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) and an impulsive function \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\) as inputs into the system described by H(s).\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we conclude that only the sinusoidal input \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) was applied without knowing whether there was an impulse at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the presence of an impulse input, \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\), it is difficult to differentiate whether the observed effects at time T are due solely to the sinusoidal input or a combined effect of both inputs, given the potential additional contribution from the impulse.",
