  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) which converts the function u(x, t) into its frequency components \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Fourier transform is invertible and unique, the reconstruction of the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x) \\\\) from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) is feasible through the inverse Fourier transform and the inverse operation related to the differential operator L, assuming that L permits such operations.",
