  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We study the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) being another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves from an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) over a time period T without any transformation applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) had been applied continuously from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Without the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the system simply follows the path given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). When \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied, it accumulates complex values influenced by both \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), leading to a different outcome because integral transformations generally modify the trajectory by amalgamating the effects over the interval.",
