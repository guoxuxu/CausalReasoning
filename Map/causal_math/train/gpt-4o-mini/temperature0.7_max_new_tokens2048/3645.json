  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant complex number. Study the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to initialize \\\\( z_0 = T(z(0)) \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T follow the same trajectory as if \\\\( z \\\\) was evolved directly from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the initial condition transformed by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is essentially a scaled version of its original state with the influence of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) offset by the transformation, the resulting dynamics effectively trace the same path, merely adjusted proportionally by the transformation.",
