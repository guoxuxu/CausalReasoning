  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( S[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{kt}z(s) ds \\\\) (k being another complex parameter) is applied as an intervention, will the output at \\\\( T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the natural dynamics and not on \\\\( s \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( S \\\\) introduces a new variable k, which, along with s from the original transformation \\\\( T \\\\), influences the resulting function at \\\\( T \\\\). The dependence on these parameters through the exponential and integral changes the outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
