  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space defined over the complex plane and explore the effects of complex function transformations based on the function \\\\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\\\), where \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of this transformation on another function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) defined in the same space that evolves under an integral transformation \\\\(H(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-ixz} dx\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the integral transformation \\\\(H(z)\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\(H(g(z))\\\\) at some later time T be equivalent to \\\\(H(h(z))\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) modifies the function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) into \\\\(h(e^{iw}z)\\\\), and when \\\\(H\\\\) is applied to this modified function, the integral transformation will respond differently due to the altered argument of \\\\(h(z)\\\\). The transformation \\\\(e^{iw}z\\\\) causes a shift in the frequency domain, thus altering the output of the integral transformation.",
