  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf partway through the evolution at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is suddenly doubled, will the trajectory after time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be identical to what it would have been without this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the frequency at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the angular velocity of rotation. Therefore, the trajectory after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will deviate from its original path, inducing a faster rotation around the complex origin thereafter.",
