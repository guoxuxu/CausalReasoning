  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = iAz \\\\), where A is a constant real number that dictates the rate of rotation in the complex plane. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{-At}z \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(z) = e^{-Bt}z\\\\) (where B is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\(g(z)\\\\) fundamentally changes the trajectory by imposing a new phase shift (rotation in the opposite direction) based on B. The final state at \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will not just depend on the original system's parameter A but will also be significantly influenced by B, the parameter dictating the rate of the new transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
