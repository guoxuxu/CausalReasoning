  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which represents a unit circle parametrized by time t. Analyze how the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), is influenced by the introduction of a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) in the function, defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, changing it to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\), and the system is observed over time without further modification, will the Laplace transform at a point s change from what it would have been without the phase shift?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a phase shift modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) fundamentally, thereby altering its Laplace transform. The transform of \\\\( e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\) results in a function shifted in the s-domain relative to the original, thus impacting the Laplace transform outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
