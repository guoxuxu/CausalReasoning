  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. Let's explore if conversions via Laplace transform, given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) impacts causal inference concerning \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a modification function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, will the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) still be recoverable directly from the transform's result for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\cdot t^2 \\\\) before transformation. This change alters the original function in a way that the inverse Laplace transform of the transformed result will not directly yield the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\), but rather \\\\( z(t) \\\\cdot t^2 \\\\) unless this modification is specifically accounted for and 'undone' during analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
