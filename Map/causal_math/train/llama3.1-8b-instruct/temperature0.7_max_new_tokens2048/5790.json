  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function z(t) measures the temperature at a point in space, evolving according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We consider the impact of a time-varying boundary condition applied as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) where B is a constant scalar.\n\nAfter observing z(T) at t = T, can we determine whether the initial condition was modified by the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) without observing z at intermediate times?",
  "Explanation": "Given z(T), different combinations of B and initial conditions could yield the same outcome due to the wide range of possible temperature distributions evolving under the heat equation. Without additional information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the usage or the parameter of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
