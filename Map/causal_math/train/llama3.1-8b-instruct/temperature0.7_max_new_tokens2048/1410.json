  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. This function is integrated over time using the transformation \\\\(F(z) = \\int_0^T f(t) z(t) dt\\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of this integral transformation when a parameter adjustment, represented by function \\\\(g(z) = ze^{i\\theta}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant, is either applied initially or during the process.\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\(z(0)\\\\) after observing the outcome of \\\\(F(z)\\\\) at T, without knowing if \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation due to \\\\(g(z)\\\\) introduces a phase shift that could have manifested in multiple ways depending on \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\). Given just the end result of \\\\(F(z)\\\\), the original state \\\\(z(0)\\\\) affected by \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or not, cannot be uniquely determined as multiple initial conditions could lead to the same integral value.",
