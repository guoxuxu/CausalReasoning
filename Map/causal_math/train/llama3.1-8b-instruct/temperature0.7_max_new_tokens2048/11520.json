  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform, which we denote as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) = F(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the specific intervention (the value and nature of \\\\( v \\\\)) applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) from the Laplace transform output \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform output \\\\( F(s) \\\\), even if indicative of the function form and the presence of perturbations, doesn't provide sufficient detailed information to reverse engineer the exact nature or specifics of the intervention such as the value of \\\\( v \\\\) due to the transformation’s complexity and the infinite possible values for \\\\( v \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
