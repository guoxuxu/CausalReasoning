  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) operating on the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. We explore how linear transformations given by matrices affect this function through Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\), characterized as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain, can we uniquely recover the time-based function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier Transform of \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) directly provides \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), due to the bijective nature of the Fourier Transform for functions satisfying certain conditions like being square integrable, which applies here.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
