  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) evolving in time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined as \\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex \\( s \\), is analyzed.\n\nIf we observe \\( T(z) \\) and know that either \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\beta \\) was influenced during \\( z(t) '\\)s evolution, can we determine exactly which frequencies and at what times the interventions happened solely from \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "As \\( T(z) \\) accumulates effects over the entire time span, different sequences or instances of interventions (altering \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\beta \\)) can correlate to indistinguishable results in \\( T(z) \\). Distinguishing precise frequencies and intervention timelines from \\( T(z) \\) alone is typically infeasible without additional time-specific data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
