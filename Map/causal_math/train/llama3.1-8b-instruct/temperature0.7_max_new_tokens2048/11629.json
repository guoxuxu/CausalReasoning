  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Question the impact of applying a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^k \\\\) at different times, where k is a positive integer.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally without further transformations up to time T, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) equal to \\\\( e^{AT}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), which raises the initial state to the power of k, fundamentally changes the baseline dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Therefore, the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}(z_0^k) \\\\) from time 0 to T differs from the unaltered path \\\\( e^{AT}z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
