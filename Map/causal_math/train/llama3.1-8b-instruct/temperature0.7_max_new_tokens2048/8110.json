  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nCan we reconstruct the pure function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) accurately at any instant from 0 to T solely from its transformed version \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without knowing S?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the factor \\\\( S \\\\) used in the transformation, the direct relationship between \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at any point and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be definitely reverse engineered due to the loss of information caused by the integration process across the exponential modification.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
