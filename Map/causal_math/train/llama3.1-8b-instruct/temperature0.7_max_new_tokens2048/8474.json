  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex variable function represented as \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA} ds \\cdot w \\), where A is a constant matrix and w is a constant vector representing initial conditions. Evaluate how the application of a Laplace transform, symbolized by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} \\), affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is invertible under broad conditions, assuming the existence and uniqueness of the inverse Laplace transform. Given the transform and assuming all conditions for the transform are met, we can uniquely retrieve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
