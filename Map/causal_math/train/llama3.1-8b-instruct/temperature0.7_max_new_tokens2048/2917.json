  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of an oscillating term. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is also a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Ct}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which changes the trajectory under the differential equation. The influence of the exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) introduces a distinct dynamic that can crucially affect the resulting state at any later time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
