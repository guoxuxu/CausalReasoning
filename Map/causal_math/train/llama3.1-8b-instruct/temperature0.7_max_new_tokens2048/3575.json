  "Problem": "Investigate the equation \\\\( dz = z \\\\cdot dt + x \\\\cdot dW \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a function of time driven by a deterministic component and a stochastic component influenced by \\\\( x \\\\), and \\\\( W \\\\) represents Brownian motion. Consider the impact of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( x \\\\) at different intervals.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( k(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( x \\\\) and not on the earlier applied \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) while initially starting with \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) means that the process \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is affected by \\\\( x^2 \\\\), and from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T by \\\\sqrt{x}. Therefore, the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both transformations, resulting in a dependency on both the initial and intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
