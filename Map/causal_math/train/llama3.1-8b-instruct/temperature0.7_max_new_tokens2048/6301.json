  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between complex functions and their integral transformations, specifically considering a complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). Does causal inference change with or without the presence of transformational modifications or interventions?\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined for all t and transformed by the Laplace transform to get \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\), will the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1}(L(z))(t) \\\\) recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without alteration?",
  "Explanation": "Under the conditions that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is piecewise continuous and of exponential order, the Laplace transform and its inverse will accurately map \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) and back to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) respectively, ensuring the recovery of the original function without alteration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
