  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\) is applied to the system at t = 0 without any changes to \\\\( u(t) \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be affected by the transformation instead of directly evolving under the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\) alters the system by integrating past states weighted by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), changing the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This modification affects future states, deviating from the trajectory that would have been followed under the linear differential equations alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
