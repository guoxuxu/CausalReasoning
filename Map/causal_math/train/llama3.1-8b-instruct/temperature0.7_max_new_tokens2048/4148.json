  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant. We are analyzing the Julia set generated by this function and explore the behavior of points under iterative applications of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nGiven a final point \\\\( z_n \\\\) in the iterated sequence, can we definitively determine the original function (whether \\\\( f \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\)) used at the start without any extra information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional details about the function's changeover point or the value of \\\\( c' \\\\) in \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to trace back and confirm which function's Julia set influenced the entire iteration sequence, particularly when multiple transformations with similar dynamics are possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "original function (f or g) → z_0; z_0 → z_1; z_1 → z_2; z_2 → z_n; z_n → Julia set behavior; Julia set behavior → original function (f or g)"
