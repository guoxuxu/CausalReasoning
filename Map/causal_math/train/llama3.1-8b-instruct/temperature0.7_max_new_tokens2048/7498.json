  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation being considered is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIs it feasible to uniquely identify the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, not knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) involving the exponential factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) was applied, the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could be any of multiple possible values depending on the phase and magnitude altered by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
