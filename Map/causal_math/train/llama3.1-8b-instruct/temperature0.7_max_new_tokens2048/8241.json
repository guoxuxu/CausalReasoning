  "Problem": "Consider a vector field \\( V \\) in a complex domain, represented as \\( V(z) = u(z) + iv(z) \\) where \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are real-valued functions of the complex variable \\( z \\). We examine the situation where an integral transform \\( T \\), particularly the Laplace Transform, is applied to \\( V \\).\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\( T \\) is applied to \\( V(z) \\) at \\( z = z_0 \\) and then \\( V \\) is allowed to evolve under its usual dynamics without further intervention, will the transformed state \\( T(V)(s) \\) at a complex variable \\( s \\) reflect only the properties of \\( V(z_0) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\( T \\) of \\( V \\) cumulatively accounts for the entire behavior of \\( V \\) along the path of integration, not just at the initial point \\( z_0 \\). Therefore, \\( T(V)(s) \\) reflects broader dynamics than just \\( V \\) at \\( z_0 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
