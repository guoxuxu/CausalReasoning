  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Analyze the impact of the Laplace transform on this function, particularly when modified by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{st}z(t) \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly transformed at time T without application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{st}z(t) \\\\) alters the initial functional form by introducing an exponential factor dependent on s. This altered form results in a different Laplace transform, as the addition of the term \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) changes the frequency and decay components of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
