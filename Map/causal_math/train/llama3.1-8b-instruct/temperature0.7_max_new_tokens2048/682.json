  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a system's state in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If unaware of the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), one cannot uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation could alter the starting point in a way that evolution under \\\\( M \\\\) alone does not reveal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state z(T) is directly influenced by M, the initial state z_0, and the function f(z), but the initial state z_0 can be determined if we know the state z(T) and the matrix M."
