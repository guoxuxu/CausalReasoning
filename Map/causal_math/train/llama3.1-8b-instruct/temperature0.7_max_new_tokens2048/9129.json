  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) and we explore the functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\). We evaluate the behavior and causal inference scenarios of this function under various transformations and time periods.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) for an input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without any further transformation, will the outcome at \\\\( x = T \\\\) be identical to directly evaluating \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) without prior transformation of \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) early modifies the trajectory of the function, as \\\\( g(z) \\\\) effectively squares the integral result and adds one, which is not the same as directly evaluating \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) at the later time T. The transformation introduces a non-linear change that affects the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
