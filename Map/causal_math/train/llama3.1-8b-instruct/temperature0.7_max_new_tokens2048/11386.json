  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-zt} dz \\\\). Let \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real positive parameter.\n\nGiven \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a particular \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) that was used in the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for a specific \\\\( t \\\\) does not uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), because the transformation complicates direct retrieval of the function form due to the integration over a complex variable and the exponential decay, which could align with several potential functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
