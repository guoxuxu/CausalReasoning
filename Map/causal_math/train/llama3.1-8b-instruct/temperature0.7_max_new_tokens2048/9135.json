  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are time-dependent functions defined in a physical system. The causal inference is analyzed through the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), where complex frequency s incorporates both decay and oscillatory behaviors.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a secondary transformation function \\\\( h(t) = e^{st} \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the future behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 strictly rely on the original function without the effects of initial Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) overlays additional dynamics onto the system, changing the inherent behavior set by the initial conditions and the original Laplace transformation of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The entirety of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post-intervention depends on the compounded effects of both the initial transformation and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
