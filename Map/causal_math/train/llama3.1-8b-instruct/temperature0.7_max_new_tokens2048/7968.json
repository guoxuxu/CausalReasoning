  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}x d\\\\tau \\), where C is another constant matrix over time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to unambiguously identify the interventions used (whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( H(x) \\\\), or both) solely based on the end state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise interventions from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is highly problematic due to the non-unique way that different matrix exponentials might overlap and affect the trajectory. Different initial conditions and intervention sequences can lead to the same endpoint, making identification based on final state alone ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
