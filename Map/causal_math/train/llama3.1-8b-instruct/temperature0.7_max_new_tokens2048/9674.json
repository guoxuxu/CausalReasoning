  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of z. The initial state \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) undergoes a transformation via the operation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents a frequency of rotation in the complex plane.\n\nCan we infer the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the transformation could have added a rotational component, resulting in multiple possible initial conditions that might yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) when subjected to the rotation over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
