  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. This function models a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). Additionally, analyze the impact of a Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), and its implications on causality inferences.\n\nCan we precisely determine the timing \\\\( t_1 \\\\) of the intervention that changed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) by analyzing the updated Laplace transformation result \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the new value of \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) can be clearly determined from the pole of \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\), the timing of the intervention (\\\\( t_1 \\\\)) cannot be directly inferred from \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) alone. The Laplace transform provides information about frequency components across the whole timeline but not when specific changes occurred during that timeline.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
