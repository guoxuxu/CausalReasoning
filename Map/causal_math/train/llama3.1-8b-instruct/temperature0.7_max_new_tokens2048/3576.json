  "Problem": "Investigate the equation \\\\( dz = z \\\\cdot dt + x \\\\cdot dW \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a function of time driven by a deterministic component and a stochastic component influenced by \\\\( x \\\\), and \\\\( W \\\\) represents Brownian motion. Consider the impact of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( x \\\\) at different intervals.\n\nBased on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specifically identify which transformations (\\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, only by knowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might be reached through several paths involving different transformations or their combinations, particularly given the initial square and subsequent square root transformations, which can influence the path in non-trivial ways. It is not feasible to conclusively determine the specific operations applied just by the outcome due to stochastic variations and possible equivalence in resultant trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
