  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. Let's analyze the effect of a transformation denoted by \\\\( h(z) = Pe^{Qt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where P is a constant matrix and Q is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to exactly deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the potential alteration of the initial state by P and the different dynamics imposed by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) render it impossible to unambiguously trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as both P and Q interfere in reversible ways with the original dynamics defined by C and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
