  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nWith known endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine both the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) only by knowing the dynamics \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) and endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) or additional constraints, it is impossible to uniquely specify what transformations were applied at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) could produce the same endpoint due to the properties of complex multiplication.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
