  "Problem": "Evaluate how the Laplace Transform impacts the causality between a pair of functions \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), where \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) and \\( u(t) \\) is its derivative using the relation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\} = sF(s) - f(0) \\), where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace Transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} \\) as \\( 2/s^2 \\), can it be inferred with certainty that \\( u(t) \\) was derived from the function \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) without direct knowledge of \\( v(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse process from \\( 2/s^2 \\) back to \\( u(t) = 2t \\) is definitive, but it cannot be uniquely concluded that \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) without other information, as other functions differentiated can also result in the same \\( u(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
