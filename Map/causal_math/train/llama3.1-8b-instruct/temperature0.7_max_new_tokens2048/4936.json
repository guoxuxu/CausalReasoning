  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. The impact of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is analyzed to understand its effects on the solution trajectory over variable \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\), is it possible to accurately discern which transformations (either \\\\(f(x)\\\\), \\\\(g(x)\\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the knowledge of \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) could emerge from various combinations of interventions owing to the linear nature and superposable properties of transformations and the differential equation. Determining precisely which transformations were applied is unfeasible due to potential intervention overlaps and the influence of each transformation on the solution's evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
