  "Problem": "We are given a complex system where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) modifies a vector \\\\( x \\\\) in a vector space over the complex numbers. The angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is constant, and the system evolves according to the operator \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x = -i\\omega x \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system with and without interventions involving a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{At}x \\\\) (where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) dramatically alters the dynamics of the system. The resultant state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on both the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The effects of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) overlay each other, impacting the system's trajectory and the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
