  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( bi \\\\) are real and imaginary components of the complex exponent respectively. The system is subject to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{(c+di)t}z \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\) being constants. Analyze the evolution and causality of this system over time.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to infer the initial conditions and the parameters \\\\( a, b \\\\) without knowledge of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, one cannot accurately determine if the changes in the state were due to the initial exponent parameters \\\\( a, b \\\\) or a combination of the initial conditions altered by \\\\( c, d \\\\). The interaction between these complex exponentials complicates back-calculations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
