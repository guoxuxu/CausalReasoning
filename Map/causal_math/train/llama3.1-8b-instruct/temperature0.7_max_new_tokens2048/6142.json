  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is a nonlinear function, representing a closed system. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t{e^{At}F(z) dt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( G(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\), which integrates the effect of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) modified by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) remains indeterminate. The presence of the matrix exponential and the integral transformation obscures the initial conditions in the absence of further information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
