  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex square matrix, binding the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of a complex variable. We analyze the behavior when applying a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the transformed output \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) is known, can we uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether it was a Laplace or another transform?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of just the transformed output without specific detail on the type of transform used (Laplace vs another) leaves room for ambiguity in reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Different transforms can yield the same output from different initial conditions or transform parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
