  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} ds \\), which represents a transformation applied to a real domain variable t. Here, s is a complex parameter and we are analyzing the behavior under linear transformations represented by matrix multiplication.\n\nIf we replace t with a linear transformation \\\\( t = At \\\\) where A is a constant matrix at t = 0, then let the transformed function evolve under its integral transformation, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be consistent with the direct integral transformation of \\\\( t = T \\\\) under the original definition?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation \\\\( t = At \\\\) changes the domain of the initial integral, leading to a different transformation path. Since the integral involves a complex exponent, the path taken significantly affects the final output due to the properties of exponential functions with complex numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
