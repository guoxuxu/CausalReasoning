  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency of the system. We explore the effects of a linear transformation \\\\(T(x) = Ax + B\\\\), where A and B are matrices, on the system's state.\n\nGiven the observed end state \\\\(x(t)\\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions (whether \\\\(T(x)\\\\), \\\\(U(x)\\\\), or both) were used only by knowing the state at time t?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of interventions (applying \\\\(T(x)\\\\), \\\\(U(x)\\\\) or both at different times) can lead to the same end state due to the linear nature of the transformations and the superposition principle. Without additional data or constraints, it cannot be conclusively determined what interventions were implemented.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Natural frequency ω → Harmonic oscillator model; Harmonic oscillator model → State x(t); Linear transformation T(x) → State x(t); Interventions (T(x), U(x)) → State x(t); State x(t) → Interventions (T(x), U(x))"
