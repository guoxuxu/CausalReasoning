  "Problem": "Let's analyze a discrete system defined using the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of a matrix A. Consider a complex function, \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - \\\\lambda_i} \\\\), applied to each eigenvalue and its effects on solving the integral, \\\\( \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{f(z)}{z - \\\\lambda_i} dz \\\\) where C is a contour encompassing all eigenvalues.\n\nCan you determine the specific eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of matrix A given the result of the integral transformation over \\\\( h(z) \\\\), assuming no other data?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral gives information about residues associated with the poles at \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\). However, without knowing the order of the residues or additional specifics from the integral's regions, determining the exact values of \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) solely based on the transformation's result is ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
