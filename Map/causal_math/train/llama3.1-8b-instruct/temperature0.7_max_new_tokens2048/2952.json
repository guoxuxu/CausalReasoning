  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane wherein a transformation \\\\( z \\\\to e^{kt} z \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where k is a complex constant. Analyze the transformation's effect on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a closed contour C.\n\nGiven the ending value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) at time T, can you determine precisely what transformations were applied (either \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), \\\\( e^{lt} \\\\), or both), just by knowing the final integral value?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral value could potentially result from different transformation sequences or types due to the complex interactions and dependencies on k and l in the transformations. These complex mappings in the integral make it challenging to deduce uniquely the interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "k → transformation; transformation → integral value; T → final integral value; final integral value → type of transformation; type of transformation → e^(kt) or e^(lt); e^(kt) or e^(lt) → T; T → k; k → l; l → T"
