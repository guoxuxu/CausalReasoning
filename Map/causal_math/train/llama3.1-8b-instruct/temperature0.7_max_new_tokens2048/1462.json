  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The effect of an external input characterized by the matrix function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) is analyzed, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely reconstruct the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T knowing only the matrix M and not N?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of N, and knowing only the transformation caused by M, it cannot be guaranteed to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) since the initial condition could have been transformed by any arbitrary instance of N which modifies the subsequent evolution under M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
