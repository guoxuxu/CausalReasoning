  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) mapping from the complex numbers to complex numbers. Let's evaluate transformations induced by this function in the context of signal processing, particularly using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) = t \\\\), and apply \\\\( f \\\\) to the Laplace transformed function.\n\nKnowing the final output of a sequence of transformations and interventions, can we accurately conclude whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or another transformation was applied after observing \\\\( f \\\\) was used on the end result?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation result can be achieved through various paths of applying \\\\( f \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), or other functions. The non-linearity and independence in function applications mean that the exact intervention sequence cannot be uniquely determined from the final output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
