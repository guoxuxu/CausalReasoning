  "Problem": "Consider the relationship governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), representing the unit circle in the complex plane. Study the behavior of the system when a transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a point \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T represent the square of the evolution that would have occurred had \\( f(z) \\) not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) at t = 0 squares the initial condition. As \\( z_0 \\) is transformed by \\( z(t) \\), the resulting trajectory \\( z(t)^2 \\) effectively doubles the angle due to the properties of exponential functions in the complex plane, aligning with what would occur if each point simply evolved from the squared initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
