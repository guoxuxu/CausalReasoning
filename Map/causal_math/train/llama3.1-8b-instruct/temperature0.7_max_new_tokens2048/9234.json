  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) applied to the function u(t, x) and investigate its evolution.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\) at time t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) \\\\) at t = T, considering no knowledge of intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible, and the linear evolution under \\\\(L\\\\) preserves the ability to reconstruct the original state from its transformed evolved state, allowing backward calculation to \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
