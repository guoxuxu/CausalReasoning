  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u + f\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(f\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the force term \\\\(f\\\\).\n\nIf, at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a different transformation, such as a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), is applied to the velocity field, will the final velocity field \\\\(u(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original force \\\\(f\\\\) and not on the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional transformation like \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) significantly alters the state and subsequent evolution of the velocity field, making the final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) dependent on both the initial force and the intermediate transformations. The Laplace transform affects the distribution and characteristics of the velocity field, intertwining with the dynamics governed by the Navier-Stokes equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
