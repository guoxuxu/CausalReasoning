  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output is governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore how the application of a Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), affects the signal analysis over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original signal \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing whether the Laplace Transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if a Laplace Transform was applied does not provide sufficient information to reconstruct the original \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\), as the integral transformation with an exponential factor and the nature of the complex frequency domain both obscure the original signal characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
