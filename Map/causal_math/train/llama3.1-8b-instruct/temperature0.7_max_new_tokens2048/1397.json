  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system defined by a Laplace transform \\\\( L[s] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}y(t) dt \\\\), where y(t) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\\\), with K being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of applying an exponential matrix function \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt} y \\\\) where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(y) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( L[s] \\\\) of the state at arbitrary time t be identical to that obtained if \\\\( y_0 \\\\) was directly subjected to \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(y) \\\\) modifies the initial state and subsequently the trajectory of the system since \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) changes the state at each time point before it evolves under \\\\( K \\\\). This affects the entirety of the temporal behavior of the vector, ultimately altering the outcome observed in the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
