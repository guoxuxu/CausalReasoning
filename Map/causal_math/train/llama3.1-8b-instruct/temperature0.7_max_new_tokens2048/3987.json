  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(w) \\) mapping complex numbers where \\( z(w) \\) is defined as \\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega w} \\), with \\( \\omega \\) being a real constant. We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( Z(v) \\) on \\( z(w) \\), defined by \\( Z(v) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(w) e^{-ivw} dw \\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift transformation \\( G(w) = z(w)e^{ia} \\) (with \\( a \\) being a real constant) is applied before \\( Z(v) \\), will \\( Z(v) \\) still isolate the Fourier component at \\( v \\) without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( G(w) = z(w)e^{ia} \\) adds a constant phase shift \\( a \\) to each frequency component of \\( z(w) \\). While \\( Z(v) \\) will still isolate the component at frequency \\( v \\), it will do so with an altered phase, thus influencing the outcome by shifting the phase of the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
