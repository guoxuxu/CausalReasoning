  "Problem": "Consider the response of an electrical system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a matrix describing the system dynamics. The system undergoes a transformation with \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{-Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. The transformations impact the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without identifying whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) due to the potential modification contributed by \\\\( Ce^{-Dt} \\\\). The system's states could deviate significantly depending on the properties of matrices C and D related to M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
