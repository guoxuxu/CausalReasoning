  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with M being a linear operator. An external force applies a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + k\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where k and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, acting on the state vector \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modifying function \\\\( j(z) = z - d\\\\cos(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where d is a constant, is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the effects caused by both \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(j(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention introduces an additional modification to the trajectory, potentially creating complex interdependencies and dynamic changes due to the overlapping effects of sine and cosine perturbations. The final state becomes dependent on both k and d, along with their respective frequencies and phases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
