  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is real and represents time, especially when transformed by another complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) = 1 \\\\) at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\), can we uniquely determine the sequence or type of interventions used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both), by observing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoints resulting from the different transformations can converge due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane; both \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) followed by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sqrt{z} \\\\), or neither could yield \\\\( z(T) = 1 \\\\), especially at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) where \\\\( e^{2i\\\\pi} = 1 \\\\). Therefore, without more information about the intermediate states, it is not possible to uniquely identify the specific interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
