  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions related to the real and imaginary parts of a complex function subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{at}z(t)\\\\} \\\\) at s = a + b, can we determine if the intervention (multiplying by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) was the sole modification made to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed transform at s = a + b resulting from applying \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) could also result from other modifications that yield the same effect on the transform. Without explicit knowledge of the nature and sequence of all operations performed, the specific intervention cannot be isolated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
