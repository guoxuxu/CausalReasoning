  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We look into the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x) dx \\\\) to the function u(x, t) and analyzing its effect over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) \\\\) is computed at t = 0 and then u(x, t) is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform of u(x, T) for some T > 0 be equal to e^{LT} \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of u(x, t) under the PDE followed by the Fourier transform yields \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, T)) = e^{LT} \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) \\\\) based on the properties of L and the Fourier transform being a linear operation. Hence, the transformation acts consistently with the linear dynamics of the PDE.",
