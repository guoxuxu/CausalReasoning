  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = z^2 + cz \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We study how the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, influences the function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = z^2 + cz \\\\) without further intervention, will the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t = T remain as if it had evolved only under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = z^2 + cz \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions through integration, affecting how the function evolves over time. The integral transformation involves all values of z over an interval, significantly altering the trajectory from what would be if only the differential equation were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
