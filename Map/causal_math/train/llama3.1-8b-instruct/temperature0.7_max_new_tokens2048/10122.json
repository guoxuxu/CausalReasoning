  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\), which operates in the complex plane. The impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\\\) is investigated, where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we reconstruct the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) uniquely from its Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\\\) without additional information or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The reconstruction of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\\\) generally requires knowledge about the path of integration and the behavior of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) along certain contours in the complex plane. Lack of this information can lead to ambiguities due to different functions potentially having the same transform under certain conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
