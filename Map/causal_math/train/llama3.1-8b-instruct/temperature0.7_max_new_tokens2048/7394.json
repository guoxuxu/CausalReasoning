  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) representing a wave at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\). Analyze the influence of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant, before applying the Laplace Transform.\n\nIf we observe the Laplace Transform result \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i \\omega} \\\\), can we unequivocally determine that the original time function was multiplied by \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific shift in the pole of the transformed function, we can conclude that an exponential decay of \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied to the original time function. This shift in the complex plane from \\\\( i \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\alpha + i \\omega \\\\) precisely indicates the multiplication by \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) before applying the Laplace Transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
