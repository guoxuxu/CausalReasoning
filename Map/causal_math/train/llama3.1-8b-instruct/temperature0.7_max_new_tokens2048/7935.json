  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in complex function theory, defined by the equation \\\\(Ax = \\\\lambda x\\\\), where A is a linear operator on a complex vector space, and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are the eigenvalues. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt\\\\) on the eigenvalues.\n\nIf during the application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), an additional operator C is instantaneously applied at some time t0, will the transformed eigenvalues at time t solely depend on the initial operator A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by operator C at time t0 modifies the trajectory originally guided by A. Consequently, the eigenvalues at any later time t are influenced by A, \\\\(e^{At0}\\\\), and C combined via the matrix exponential, thus making them dependent on more than just A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
