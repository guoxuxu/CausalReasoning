  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by a vector function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( v(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, t)](k) \\\\), and subsequently manipulating the system using a filter function \\\\( H(k) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( w(k, T) \\\\), can we determine which interventions were used (whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), \\\\( H(k) \\\\), or both), solely based on the transformed state without any record of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( w(k, T) \\\\) could be generated from various combinations of initial conditions and interventions. Without explicit records of interventions such as the application of \\\\( H(k) \\\\), it is impossible to conclusively determine the path or sequence of manipulations that led to \\\\( w(k, T) \\\\), especially considering the many ways \\\\( H(k) \\\\) could interact with the initial and evolving states.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
