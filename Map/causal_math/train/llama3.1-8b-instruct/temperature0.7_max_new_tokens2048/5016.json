  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system under a specific transformation, where \\( z(t) \\) represents a complex function of time \\( t \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), with \\( \\omega \\) constant. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is utilized to study the system's frequency domain characteristics.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform from a manipulated \\( z(t) \\) where frequency might have been changed at an unknown \\( t_1 \\), can we conclude whether and when such an intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity added by the potential change at an unknown \\( t_1 \\) results in a Laplace transform that cannot conclusively indicate the specific time or nature of the intervention, as multiple scenarios could lead to similar transformations in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
