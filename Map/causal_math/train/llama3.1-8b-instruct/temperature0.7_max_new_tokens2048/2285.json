  "Problem": "Let's consider the complex plane where the function is defined as \\( z \\mapsto w = e^z \\). Investigate how the transformation of this function affects the analytical structure of a complex domain, specifically whether causal inference about the original complex value (z) can be derived from its transformation (w) under various circumstances.\n\nDoes the transformation \\( w = e^z \\) on its own maintain the entire information of z such as determining z completely from w at any time \\( t \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential map \\( w = e^z \\) is not injective over the complex plane due to the periodicity of the exponential function in the imaginary direction. This means multiple different values of z can map to the same w, losing some information about the original z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
