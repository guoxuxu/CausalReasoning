  "Problem": "Let's analyze a scenario involving the Laplace transform in the context of signal processing. The initial signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) is given, and its transformation through the Laplace transform is considered as \\\\( S(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(s(t))(s) \\\\). Various manipulations and operations are applied to study the causal relationships between transformations and signals.\n\nGiven a transformed signal \\\\( \\\\tilde{S}(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we definitively infer both the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and the intervention (if any) applied, based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\tilde{S}(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The representation in the s-domain can result from various combinations of initial signals and interventions (like convolutions or other transformations). Since the Laplace transform is linear but not injective across all operations, it's impossible to uniquely decompose \\\\( \\\\tilde{S}(s) \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
