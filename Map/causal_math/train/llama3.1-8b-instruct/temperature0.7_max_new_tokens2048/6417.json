  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a curve in the complex plane given by \\\\( z = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, describing an oscillator. We investigate the effects of a linear transformation described by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\\\\\\\ b & a \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) which rotates and scales the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and the system is allowed to evolve under the original oscillator equations without further operation, will the nature of the orbit, i.e., its geometric path in the complex plane, remain invariant at time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( M \\\\) modifies not only the magnitude but also the direction of \\\\( z(0) \\\\), leading to a rotated and scaled orbit. The change in the initial conditions under the matrix M will affect both the trajectory and final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
