  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nAfter applying the FT to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\), can we accurately determine that the original signal was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "With only the Fourier Transform outcome of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), and not knowing about the pre-transformation multiplication by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), it is impossible to reconstruct the original signal uniquely. The frequency shift could mask or mimic effects of other potential transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
