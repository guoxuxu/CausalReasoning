  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real constant matrix and z a complex number. We study the behavior of this function when subject to transformations and analyze the inverse Laplace transformation which is given by \\\\( F(p) = L^{-1} \\\\{ f(z) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and matrix A be retrieved uniquely by analyzing the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) if no additional information about interventions is given?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( F(p) \\\\) is based on the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) which could correspond to multiple combinations of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and A unless there's a one-to-one correspondence. Without additional constraints or data about the transformation parameters (e.g., specific properties of A), retrieving both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and A uniquely is impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
