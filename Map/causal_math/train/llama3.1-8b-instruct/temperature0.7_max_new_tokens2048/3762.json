  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior under the transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant, analyzing the time evolution represented by this transformation.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to conclusively infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can correspond to multiple initial conditions due to the ambiguity created by the exponential growth or shrinkage in magnitude introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) at t = 0. The phase evolution alone cannot determine the exact initial state's magnitude.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
