  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) \\\\), which changes the domain from time-space to frequency-time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T be represented identically in the Fourier space?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform shifts the representation to the frequency domain, modifying how the differential equation impacts the function over time. The evolution under L might not preserve the same characteristics in the Fourier space, particularly if L has properties that affect different frequencies differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
