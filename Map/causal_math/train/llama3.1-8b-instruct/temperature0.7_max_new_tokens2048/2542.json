  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} [u(x)] = M u(x) \\\\) where M is a linear operator. An operator transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Nx} u(x) \\\\) is introduced, with N being another linear operator. Analyze the influence of this transformation on the behavior of the function u(x) over the domain.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = X without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge about the application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\), it is unclear whether the observed function at x = X has been altered by \\\\( e^{Nx} \\\\). The modifications due to N can mask or alter the features of \\\\( u_0 \\\\), leading to ambiguity in reconstructing the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
