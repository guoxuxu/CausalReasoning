  "Problem": "Evaluate the causality in a system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze this under the operation of the integral transformation represented by \\(\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt\\), where \\(D\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\(z(T)\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\), \\(h(z)\\), or both) solely by knowing the value of \\(z(T)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the non-linear and overlapping influences of \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) on top of the evolution under \\(C\\), different combinations of interventions might lead to equivalent end states \\(z(T)\\). This complexity makes it infeasible to precisely backtrack to specific interventions without additional information on the dynamics or sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
