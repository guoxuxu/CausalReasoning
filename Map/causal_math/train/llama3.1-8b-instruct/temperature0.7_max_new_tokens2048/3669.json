  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyzing the system under the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is given as zero and the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at any s satisfy the equation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With \\\\( z(0) = 0 \\\\), the differential equation simplifies in the Laplace domain to \\\\( sZ(s) - z(0) = -i\\\\omega Z(s) + \\\\frac{k}{s} \\\\), which gives \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\). The system's evolution directly follows from the Laplace transformation of the governing equation without any external modification.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
