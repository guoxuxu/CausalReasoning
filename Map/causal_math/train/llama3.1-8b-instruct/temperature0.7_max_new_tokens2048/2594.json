  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\), where \\\\(w(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\) over a variable t, with z as a complex variable. The function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed via another function \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\). Analyze the impact of transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to \\\\(g(t)\\\\) on the complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\).\n\nGiven the form of \\\\(w(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\), can we infer whether the transformation \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\) was applied initially by analyzing the structure of \\\\(w(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant expression for \\\\(w(z)\\\\) only shows the integration with respect to \\\\(e^{zt}f(t)\\\\) without explicitly revealing the form of \\\\(f(t)\\\\). Without additional information about the role of \\\\(t^2\\\\) in the integrand, one cannot uniquely determine if the transformation to \\\\(g(t)\\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
