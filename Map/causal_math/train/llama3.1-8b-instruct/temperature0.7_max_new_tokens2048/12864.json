  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s\\\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period from 0 to T.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the resultant function at t = T be equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T under its original definition?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the function from a simple complex exponential to an integral of exponential terms, altering the nature and behavior of the function significantly over the interval [0, T].",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
