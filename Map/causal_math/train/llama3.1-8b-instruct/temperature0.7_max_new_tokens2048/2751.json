  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We apply a Laplace transform on \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and explore how the transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), behaves under different initial conditions and interventions with additional transformations.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a complex constant, is applied as an intervention to the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before applying the Laplace transform, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s \\\\) still be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) results in the combined function \\\\( e^{(a+b)z} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function becomes \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\), altering the resultant transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
