  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where T is a specific time point greater than zero.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is subsequently applied without any further intervention, will the output at time T be equivalent to directly applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial input by integrating the effect of the matrix exponential over time, altering the starting point on which \\\\( f(z) \\\\) acts. Since the integral accumulates effects of exponential growth of the matrix over time, the initial conditions are fundamentally changed before \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied, hence giving different outputs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
