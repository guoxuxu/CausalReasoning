  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and z is a complex-valued function of time t. Investigate the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is another real constant, on the evolution of z.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which interventions (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the interval [0, T], solely from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of interventions with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at different times, especially considering that these transformations can neutralize or reinforce each other depending on their application timing. The non-trivial interaction between exponential scaling and complex rotation introduces ambiguity in determining the specific interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
