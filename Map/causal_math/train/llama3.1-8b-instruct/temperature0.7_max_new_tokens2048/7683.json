  "Problem": "Let's consider two complex functions \\( f(z) = e^z \\) and \\( g(z) = \\sin(z) \\) applied to a complex variable \\( z \\). The behavior of these functions under the Laplace transform is studied, where the transformation is denoted \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} \\) and applied as an intervention.\n\nIf, at time \\( t_1 \\), another function \\( g(z) = \\sin(z) \\) is introduced as an intervention affecting the state \\( z(t_1) \\), will the final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) still be predicted accurately using only the initial function \\( f \\) and its Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\sin(z) \\) as an intervention modifies the previously computed trajectory under \\( f(z) = e^z \\). The new behavior induced by \\( g(z) \\) modifies the properties of the state due to non-linear transformations involved, leading to a final state \\( z(T) \\) that cannot be solely predicted by the initial conditions and \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
