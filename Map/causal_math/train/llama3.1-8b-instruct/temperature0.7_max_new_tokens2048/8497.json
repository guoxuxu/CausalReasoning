  "Problem": "In a control system environment, the system state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the linear system dynamics \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) where D is a linear operator. An impulse response given by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another linear operator, is considered over time intervals.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and the system is then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) till time T, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be equal to the direct evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) for time T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\) changes the starting conditions of the system. Since this new initial condition \\\\( Kx_0 \\\\) is what evolves according to \\\\( D \\\\), the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will be affected by \\\\( K \\\\) and hence different from the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
