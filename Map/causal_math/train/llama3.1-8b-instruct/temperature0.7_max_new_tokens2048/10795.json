  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) representing oscillatory behavior with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). We examine the scenario where we apply a Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thereby transforming the function into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an alteration is made post-Fourier transform, specifically an amplitude modulation in the frequency domain, will the inverse Fourier transform still yield the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Amplitude modulation or any other alteration in the frequency domain fundamentally changes the spectral characteristics of the signal. Consequently, the inverse Fourier transform will reflect these modifications, resulting in a distortion of the original time-domain signal \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
