  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions describing a physical system. We investigate a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency, applied to this system over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to the dynamics \\( \\dot{z} = \\lambda z \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is a complex constant, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = \\lambda z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(z) \\) modifies the initial state of the system, imparting a rotational component due to the term \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). This leads to a trajectory that differs fundamentally from that which arises from the direct integration of \\( \\dot{z} = \\lambda z \\). The resultant state at time T depends not only on the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) but also significantly on the parameter \\( \\omega \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
