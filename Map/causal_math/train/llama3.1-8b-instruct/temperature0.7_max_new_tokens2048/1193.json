  "Problem": "Consider the transform \\\\( z = f(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\), which maps the input x to a complex domain. We analyze how the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) impacts the causality and the influence of various interventions represented by other transforms such as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\sin(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf the transform \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to an input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = e^{x^2}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( f(x) \\\\) return to the same value at \\\\( x = T \\\\) as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was uninitialized?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( f(x) \\\\) leads to a unique, path-dependent integral value. As the function \\\\( e^{x^2} \\\\) is not constant and lacks periodicity, the response at any \\\\( x = T \\\\) strictly depends on the initial value \\\\( x_0 \\\\), making it distinctly different if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was not used as a starting point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
