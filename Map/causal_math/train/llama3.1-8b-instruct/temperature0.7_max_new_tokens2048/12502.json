  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the following operator equation \\( \\mathcal{L}(x) = D^2x + 2x \\) where \\( D \\) represents the differential operator with respect to variable \\( t \\). Assess how the introduction of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) modifies the system.\n\nIf the system is subjected to an additional transformation \\( \\mathcal{G}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-pt}x(t) \\, dt \\) at \\( t_1 > 0 \\), will the subsequent behavior of \\( x(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) be independent of the initial Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) as a new transformation combines with the effects of the existing Laplace transformation (if it was applied). The interplay between \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) can result in a composite transformation effect, which makes the behavior of \\( x(t) \\) dependent on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
