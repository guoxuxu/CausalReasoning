  "Problem": "Consider a heat conduction process governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( u_t \\) and \\( u_{xx} \\) denote the temporal and spatial second derivatives of \\( u \\) respectively, and \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The initial condition is \\( u(x, 0) = \\phi(x) \\). Analysis involves examining the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(s, t) \\) applied at t = 0.\n\nCan we reconstruct \\( \\phi(x) \\) perfectly from \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\) at t = T if no additional information is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\), the Fourier inversion theorem allows the exact reconstruction of \\( u(x, T) \\), and since the solution depends linearly on \\( \\phi(x) \\), \\( \\phi(x) \\) can be determined from \\( u(x, T) \\) given the boundary and initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
