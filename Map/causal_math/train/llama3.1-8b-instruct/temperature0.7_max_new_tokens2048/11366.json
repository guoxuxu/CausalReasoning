  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dx = (Ax + u)dt + BdW\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are constant matrices, \\\\(u\\\\) is a control input, and \\\\(dW\\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We analyze how the output function \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) behaves under different conditions, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix outputting the observable state.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( f(x(T)) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without prior knowledge of the noise contribution from \\\\( dW \\\\) over the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The randomness introduced by the Wiener process \\\\( dW \\\\) leads to different possible trajectories that could yield the same output at \\\\( T \\\\). The uncertainty from \\\\( dW \\\\) means that multiple, distinct initial conditions could lead to the same observed output without a definite way to pinpoint which was the original \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x → dx; dx → x; u → dx; W → dx; x → f(x); f(x) → f(x(T)); x(T) → initial condition"
