  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\). Analyze the causal relationship between initial conditions, transformations, and system outputs.\n\nIf the system's state at a time \\( t_1 \\) undergoes an intervention through a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\{z(t)\\} \\), will the system's state at a later time \\( T \\) be governed only by the natural dynamics \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) alters the system's state significantly, introducing another layer of complexity into the evolution. The final state \\( z(T) \\) now depends on both the natural dynamics and the effects of the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
