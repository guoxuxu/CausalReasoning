  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the coupled equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). The influence of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is analyzed under different scenarios.\n\nKnowing the modified Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some final time T, can we determine both the exact nature of any interventions (like \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) and the original system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping influences and potential confounders introduced by the intervention and the original system dynamics, deducing the precise interventions and original dynamics from the final Laplace Transform is not feasible without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
