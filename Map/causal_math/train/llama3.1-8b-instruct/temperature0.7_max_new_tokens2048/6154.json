  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by a matrix equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We study the system's behavior under a transformation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Ct}x\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is another constant matrix, and how interventions using matrix \\\\(D\\\\) affect the solution.\n\nGiven the matrix equation \\\\(Ax(T) = b\\\\) holds for a transformed vector \\\\(x(T) = e^{CT}x_0\\\\), can we infer the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) accurately without knowing whether the transformation with \\\\(C\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Ct}x\\\\) was applied, it is not possible to definitively trace back to \\\\(x_0\\\\) as the exponential transformation \\\\(e^{CT}\\\\) alters the vector in a way that \\\\(x_0\\\\) might not uniquely satisfy the equation \\\\(Ax_0 = b\\\\) anymore.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
