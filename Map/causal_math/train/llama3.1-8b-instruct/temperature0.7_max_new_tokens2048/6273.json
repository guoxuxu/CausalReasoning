  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system's state is transformed by a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), which modifies the state into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( F(u) \\\\) transforms \\\\( u_0 \\\\) into the frequency domain, potentially altering the system's characteristics in a way that affects the temporal evolution under L. The transformed state's evolution under L in the frequency domain can result in a different state at time T compared to the original domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
