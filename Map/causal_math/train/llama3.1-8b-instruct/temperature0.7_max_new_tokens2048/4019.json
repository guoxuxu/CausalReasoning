  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} u(t) dt \\\\) applied to a function u(t). We study how applying another transformation \\\\( S[u](t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) either before or after T affects relations.\n\nIf intervention \\\\( S[u](t) \\\\) is applied at some intermediate time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), transforming u partially, and then the entire transformed u(t) undergoes transformation T, does the end result depend only on \\\\( T[u](x) \\\\) without intervention or both T and S?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function after the intermediate application of S and then T depends on both transformations. S alters the function u(t) even if partially, and these changes will influence how T operates over the entire range, making the resultant u(x) dependent on the effects of both S and T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
