  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving through a vector field described by the velocity function \\\\( v(x, t) = Ax + h(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and h(t) is a time-dependent vector function. We explore the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{As}x ds \\\\) on the particle's trajectory.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) is applied to a particle initially at position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and the system evolves naturally under \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) alters the initial trajectory by adding an integrated effect of the exponential of A over time to the position, which is not equivalent to simple evolution under the original velocity function. Therefore, the position at time T will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
