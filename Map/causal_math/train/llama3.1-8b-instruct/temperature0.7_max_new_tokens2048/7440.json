  "Problem": "Let's examine a scenario involving a complex function and its transformation using a Fourier Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a frequency. We analyze the effect of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function.\n\nKnowing only the Fourier Transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(Az(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine whether an amplitude scaling by \\\\( A \\\\) or some other transformation was used on \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform result showing a scaled delta function cannot conclusively indicate the type of transformation applied. It could be a simple amplitude scaling or another transformation that proportionally scales the magnitude of the function while preserving its frequency, resulting in ambiguity about the specific intervention used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
