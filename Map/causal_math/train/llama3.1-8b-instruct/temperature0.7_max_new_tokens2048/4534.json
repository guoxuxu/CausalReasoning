  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is studied, where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the transformation through \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) may have modified the initial state in a way that isn't simply reversible just by knowing M and observing the state at time T. The potential initial states could correspond to multiple plausible scenarios.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
