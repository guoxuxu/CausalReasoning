  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(0, x)]\\\\) is applied to the initial condition at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t,x)]\\\\) at t = T be determined solely by the evolution under \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial conditions provides the initial frequency domain representation. The linear character of both the differential equation and the Fourier transform ensures that the evolution in the transformed domain is still dictated by the initial equation, applying the shift property of the Fourier transform which directly corresponds to the equation's characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
