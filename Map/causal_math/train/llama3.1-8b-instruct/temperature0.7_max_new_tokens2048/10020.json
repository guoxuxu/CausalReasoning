  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, and D as constants. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to identify precisely which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, when also considering interventions like changes in \\\\( \\\\omega, k, \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying exactly which transformations were applied is complex due to the overlapping potential influences each transformation can have on the system's behavior. The final outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of phase shifts and applied frequencies, leading to ambiguity in causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
