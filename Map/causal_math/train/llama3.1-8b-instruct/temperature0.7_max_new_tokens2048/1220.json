  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) where f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact of a complex function transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and its corresponding transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform result \\\\( H(s) \\\\) after intervention, can we determine exactly whether the original function was transformed to \\\\( t^2 f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) = e^{-t} f(t) \\\\) based only on the knowledge of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone doesn’t provide sufficient information to clearly distinguish between the original transformation being \\\\( t^2 f(t) \\\\) and the intervention transformation \\\\( e^{-t} f(t) \\\\). This lack of clear distinction arises due to the integrative effect of the Laplace transform concealing specific details of the applied transformations in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
