  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = F(x, y) \\\\) that maps complex numbers \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) to \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( F(x, y) = x^2 + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( F \\\\) and its derivatives across transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(x, y) = (e^{Ax}x, e^{By}y) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we deduce the precise original inputs \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\) if no additional information about the use of transformations \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific transformations applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( y_0 \\\\) through \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\), and given the non-invertibility and non-linear nature of \\\\( F \\\\) when combined with exponential transformations, it is not possible to uniquely identify the original inputs from the resultant \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
