  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, acting on the time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). We examine the effect of Fourier Transform on \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and explore how these transformations influence causal relationships.\n\nFrom the Fourier Transformed state, can we conclusively infer whether both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( m(t) \\\\) were applied, or neither, only based on observing that the frequency content corresponds to the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed unshifted frequency spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in the Fourier Transform might suggest that no frequency modulation took place. However, both opposing modulation effects of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( m(t) \\\\) could have been applied, exactly canceling each other, leading to the original spectrum. Without additional information, one cannot distinguish these scenarios solely based on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
