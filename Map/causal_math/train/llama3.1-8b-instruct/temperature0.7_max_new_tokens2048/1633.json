  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We're curious about the nature of the function under the Laplace transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). Consider s as a complex parameter and investigate specific properties under direct transformations and interventions.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) is applied to the function without any modifications, does the result depend uniquely on the function \\\\( f \\\\) without considering the path of integration in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) can vary depending on the path taken in the complex plane due to the multi-valued nature and essential singularities of \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\). Thus, the result is not purely a function of \\\\( f \\\\) but also of the path of integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
