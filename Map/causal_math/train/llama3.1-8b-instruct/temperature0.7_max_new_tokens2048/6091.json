  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + Dx\\\\), with constant coefficients A, B, C, and D. The effect of a linear transformation \\\\(T\\\\) described by the matrix \\\\(\\\\begin{pmatrix} E & F \\\\\\\\ G & H \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another linear transformation \\\\(S\\\\) described by a matrix \\\\(\\\\begin{pmatrix} I & J \\\\\\\\ K & L \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on the coefficients A, B, C, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(S\\\\), much like \\\\(T\\\\), introduces additional variables into the evolving state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). The nature and impact of I, J, K, and L in conjunction with E, F, G, H (from T) and the original coefficients A, B, C, D contribute collectively to the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), making it dependent on all these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
