  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation describing heat transfer \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We study the impact of applying a Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification by another integral transform (like a Laplace transform denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the natural heat distribution dynamics and not on the Fourier or Laplace transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) introduces additional complexities into the system, affecting how the temperature evolves spatially and temporally. Both \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) can impact the calculation of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), altering its dependency not just on initial conditions and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) but also on the properties and effects of the transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
