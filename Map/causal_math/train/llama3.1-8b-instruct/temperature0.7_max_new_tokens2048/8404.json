  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2} h(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given real function. We evaluate scenarios where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is modified by transformations such as \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\).\n\nGiven the integral value \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the exact nature of the interventions (whether \\\\( f(h) \\\\), \\\\( g(h) \\\\), or both) based only on the endpoint value?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used based on the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging because different combinations of modifications to \\\\( h(s) \\\\) might lead to the same or similar integral values. The non-unique effect of adding and subtracting polynomial terms to \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in the integrand makes identification uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
