  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical model where an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A and s are scalars indicating the rate constants.\n\nBy applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and letting it evolve without any further action, will this change the outcome \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\) compared to directly integrating \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from t=0 to infinity?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) causes an analytic interpretation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) yielding \\\\( T(f)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) when \\\\( s > A \\\\), altering the result from its non-transformed integral would be infinite if A > 0, showcasing a fundamental change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
