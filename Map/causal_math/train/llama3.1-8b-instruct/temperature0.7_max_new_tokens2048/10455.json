  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation function \\\\( k(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is used as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) adds a shift to the complex number which compounds with the initial transformation effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). This makes the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the earlier squared state plus the subsequent shift, reflecting the impacts of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
