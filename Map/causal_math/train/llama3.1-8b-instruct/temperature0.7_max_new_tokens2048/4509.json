  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a real variable z. We are analyzing the treatment effect of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(f)(z) = \\int_0^z f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(f) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any further transformations, will the outcome \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at z = T differ from the direct evaluation of the integral from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( T(f) \\\\) specifically calculates the integral of \\\\( f \\\\) from 0 to z. Therefore, evaluating it directly or through this operator on \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) to z = T will yield the same result, as no modifications or external interventions change the nature of the function within the integral limits.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
