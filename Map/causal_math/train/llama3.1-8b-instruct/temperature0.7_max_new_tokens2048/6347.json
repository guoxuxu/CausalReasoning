  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where the evolution of a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time t is governed by the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt\\\\). Let's analyze how the system behavior changes with the introduction of a convolution transformation with another function \\\\(h(t)\\\\), defined by \\\\(w(t) = (z * h)(t)\\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention using a different convolution function \\\\(k(t)\\\\) is applied, will the system's behavior at \\\\(t = T\\\\) for T > t_1 reflect only the influence of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and not the effects of \\\\(h(t)\\\\) or \\\\(k(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\\\(k(t)\\\\) adds another convolution, making the system's subsequent behavior and transformation depend not only on the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) but significantly on both convolution functions \\\\(h(t)\\\\) and \\\\(k(t)\\\\). This multiple convolution effect compounds the complexity in predicting system behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
