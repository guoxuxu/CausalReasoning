  "Problem": "We analyze a heat equation \\(\\partial u/\\partial t = \\alpha \\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2\\) for a rod initially subject to a temperature distribution \\(u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) with \\(\\alpha > 0\\). Let's evaluate the effects of applying a Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine component.\n\nAfter observing \\(u(x, t)\\) at a later time \\(T\\), can we distinguish whether the Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) was applied at \\(t = 0\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\(\\mathcal{F}_s(u(x, 0))\\) retains the initial condition as \\(\\sin(\\pi x)\\), the temperature distribution \\(u(x, t)\\) evolved under the heat equation does not reveal whether \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) was applied, as it results in the same state evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
