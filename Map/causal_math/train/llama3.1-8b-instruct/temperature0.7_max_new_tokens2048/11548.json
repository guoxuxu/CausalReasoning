  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Fourier Transform applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, which is then subjected to operations described by a differential equation \\\\( L[g(x)] = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dx^2} - k^2g \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the solution in the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) after an intervention, can we determine what the specific intervention (like the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\)) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The solution in the frequency domain may correspond to multiple potential interventions due to the linear properties and possible overlap in effects caused by different transformations in the spatial domain. Identifying a unique intervention from \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) is generally not feasible without additional context or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
