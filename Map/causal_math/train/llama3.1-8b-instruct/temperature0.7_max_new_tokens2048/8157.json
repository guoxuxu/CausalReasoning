  "Problem": "Analyze the role of the Laplace transform in a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t + Au = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a linear operator. We consider the application of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = U(s) \\\\) and explore the repercussions on the system's response over time.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform to the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then allowing the system to evolve according to the given PDE without further intervention alter the final form of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) at steady state compared to not using the Laplace transform initially?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform to the initial condition simply changes the domain from time to frequency, providing a different perspective of the system's dynamics. Both the transformed and original systems will converge to their respective steady states determined by \\\\( A \\\\), and the fundamental behavior remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Laplace transform → U(s) defined; U(s) defined → System evolves according to PDE; System evolving according to PDE → u(t) defined; Applying Laplace transform → No further intervention; No further intervention → u(t) defined; u(t) defined → u_0 defined; System evolving according to PDE → u_0 defined; System evolving according to PDE → U(s) defined; U(s) defined → Steady state; u_0 defined → Steady state; Steady state → U(s) at steady state"
