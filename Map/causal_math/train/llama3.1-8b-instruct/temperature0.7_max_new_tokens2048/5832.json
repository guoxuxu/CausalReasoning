  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), and assume a perturbation in the form of multiplication by a complex exponential, \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is an original signal and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency.\n\nCan we specify which exponential modifications (\\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega t} \\\\) or both) were applied to the original \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by merely analyzing the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) at a series of points in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "Each modification results in a translation in the s-domain. Unless the timings and nature (whether addition or cancellation) of these exponentials are known, reconstructing the exact sequence or type of interventions from the transform alone is indeterminate due to the possible overlapping effects and reliance on initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
