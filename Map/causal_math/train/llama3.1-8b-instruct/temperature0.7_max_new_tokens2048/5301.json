  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant thermal diffusivity. Examine the impact of applying a transformation with the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which introduces a new component that evolves differently under the heat equation. Thus, the state of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T will differ due to the influence of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) on the transformation dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
