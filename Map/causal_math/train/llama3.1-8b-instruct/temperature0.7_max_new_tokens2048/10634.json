  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the original function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transformation into the complex s-plane. We study the effects of a convolution operation with a kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented by its transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we determine if this was the result of convolving some original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with a kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\), it cannot be conclusively determined if \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is a product of two transforms or originated from a single function, due to the possibility of similar results from different convolutions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
