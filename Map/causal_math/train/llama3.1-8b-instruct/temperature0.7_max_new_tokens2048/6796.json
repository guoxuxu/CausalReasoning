  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = T^{-1}e^{Dt}Tx \\\\) is considered, where T is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine which transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely identify the transformations used due to the potential overlapping effects and the ambiguity in exponential matrix interactions. Several different combinations of initial states and transformations could lead to the same endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
