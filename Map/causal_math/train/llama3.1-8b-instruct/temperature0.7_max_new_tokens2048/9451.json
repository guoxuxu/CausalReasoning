  "Problem": "Let's explore a system involving a stochastic variable X following the distribution \\(f_X(x) = e^{-x}\\) for \\(x > 0\\) and the integral transform \\(T[X] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx} f_X(x) dx\\). We're interested in evaluating the implications of changing the parameter \\(t\\) within the transform, specifically for \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nIf \\(t\\) is initially set at 1, and an intervention adjusts \\(t\\) to a new value at a later time, will the new value of \\(T[X]\\) depend solely on the last setting of \\(t\\) and not the initial?",
  "Explanation": "The latest value of \\(t\\) imposes its effect on the integral \\(T[X]\\) overriding the previous conditions—since the transform computes using the current t-value, it reflects the changes dynamically and depends only on the latest \\(t\\) value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
