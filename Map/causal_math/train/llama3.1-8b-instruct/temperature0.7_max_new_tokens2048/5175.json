  "Problem": "Let us consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) represents a control input vector. The Laplace transform \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) applied to this system results in \\( X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + (sI - A)^{-1}x(0) \\) where \\( U(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\).\n\nIf a different matrix \\( C \\) is used to modify the system matrix \\( A \\) to \\( A+C \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will this change reflect in the Laplace transform \\( X(s) \\) for all values of \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the system matrix from \\( A \\) to \\( A+C \\) changes the system dynamics, which is reflected in the Laplace transform through the term \\( (sI - (A+C))^{-1} \\). This change affects how the system responds to inputs and initial conditions, thus modifying \\( X(s) \\) across all complex values \\( s \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
