  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex square matrix, binding the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of a complex variable. We analyze the behavior when applying a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and applying \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) to it, would this transformation yield the same output if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were transformed by any other integral transform, such as Fourier transform, without altering \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace and Fourier transforms handle the decay and frequency components differently due to their kernels, \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) versus \\\\( e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\). The type of transformation significantly affects the outcome, hence using a different one like Fourier transform would yield different results.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
