  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system governed by a vector field \\\\(V(z) = i\\\\beta z\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant. The transformation considered is \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, and t represents time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(V(z)\\\\) without further intervention, will the final position \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) were evolved directly under \\\\(V(z)\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the trajectory by scaling the initial point. Since the vector field depends linearly on z, and \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) modifies the magnitude and potentially the phase of z, the trajectory will differ, affecting the final position at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
