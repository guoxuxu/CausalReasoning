  "Problem": "Assume the function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number, represents a physical process. We explore the effects of the operation \\( h(z) = e^{kt}z \\) on \\( z(t) \\), with \\( k \\) being another real constant.\n\nWhen the transformation \\( h(z) \\) is applied at time \\( t=0 \\) on an initial condition \\( z_0 \\) and then evolved according to \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) for a time period \\( T \\), will the resulting \\( z(T) \\) be equivalent to the instance where \\( z_0 \\) is directly evolved by \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) for the same period?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\( h(z) \\) alters \\( z_0 \\) to \\( e^{k \\cdot 0} z_0 = z_0 \\), but as t progresses, the factor \\( e^{kt} \\) scales and rotates \\( z(t) \\) differently as compared to purely evolving under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), leading to a varying trajectory and therefore a different final state at \\( t=T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
