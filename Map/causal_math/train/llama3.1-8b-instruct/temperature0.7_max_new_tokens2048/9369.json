  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic functional integral equation system governed by \\\\(I(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-x^2 + xt} dt\\\\). We examine the effects of applying the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty I(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k)\\\\) is computed for a function I(x) as defined, and no other transformation is applied, does the resulting function fundamentally alter its analytical properties?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of I(x), which involves an exponential quadratic, results in changes to the function's properties, such as its decay rate and oscillatory behavior. The integral transformation alters how the function manifests in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
