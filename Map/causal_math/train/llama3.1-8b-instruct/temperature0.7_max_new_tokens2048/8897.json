  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) describes the voltage distribution over a line at position x and time t, and v is a positive constant reflecting the properties of the material. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the voltage distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at time T represent the same system state as if the initial voltage distribution was directly evolved to T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation that translates the partial differential equation into a simpler form where the evolution in time can be separately applied to each frequency component. The initial and transformed systems evolve identically under the assumption that the system is linear and the boundary conditions remain consistent.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
