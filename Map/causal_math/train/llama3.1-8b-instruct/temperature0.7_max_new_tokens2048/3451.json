  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the scenario where an integral transform \\\\( K(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(x, s)u(s, t) ds \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) being a kernel function.\n\nAssuming that at a certain time t1 an additional operation \\\\( J(u) = \\\\int_0^x j(x, s) u(s, t) ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the system's state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t1 be influenced only by L and not by the transforms \\\\( K(u) \\\\) or \\\\( J(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( J(u) \\\\) introduces another layer of modification, making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on the effects of both \\\\( K(u) \\\\) and \\\\( J(u) \\\\), as well as the operator L. Each transformation influences the system's trajectory and ultimately the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
