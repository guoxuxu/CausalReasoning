  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( F(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( F(z) \\), and considering the influence of \\( \\lambda \\) on the evolution, it is not feasible to retrieve \\( z_0 \\) uniquely; the observed \\( z(t) \\) could result from various initial conditions altered by different \\( \\lambda \\) values.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
