  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the input function. We explore the effects of applying a differentiation operator, defined by \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) = t^\\\\alpha \\\\frac{d^\\\\alpha}{dt^\\\\alpha} f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a fractional differentiation order.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an integration operator \\\\( I_\\\\beta(f)(t) = t^{-\\\\beta} \\\\int_0^t (\\\\tau^{-\\\\beta} f(\\\\tau)) d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied as an intervention to function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), does the final Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace Transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) reflects the cumulative effect of both the differentiation and integration, which are both dependent on their respective orders, \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Each operator modifies the function's frequency and time-domain characteristics, thereby making it dependent on both operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
