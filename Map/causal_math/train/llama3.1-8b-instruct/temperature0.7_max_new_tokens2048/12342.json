  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. Let's examine the system's behavior under the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and perform perturbations using multiplication by another function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive real constant.\n\nIf after applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\) is multiplied at a time \\( t_1 \\), does this alter the final frequency spectrum to include frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\) post transformation affects the frequency spectrum. The multiplication corresponds to a convolution in the frequency domain with \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{h(t)\\} \\), broadening the original delta function and introducing components at frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\), centered around \\( \\omega \\) but with a decay rate governed by \\( \\alpha \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
