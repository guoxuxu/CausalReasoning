  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output, \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is derived from the input, \\\\( x(t) \\\\), via a complex function and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bx(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the interval [0, T], changing it to a new function \\\\( \\\\tilde{x}(t) \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be solely dependent on \\\\( \\\\tilde{x}(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) accumulates influences through the integral of input signals over time, therefore it depends on both the new function \\\\( \\\\tilde{x}(t) \\\\) post-intervention and the historical \\\\( x(t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The final output integrates all contributions from the initial condition up to the new intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
