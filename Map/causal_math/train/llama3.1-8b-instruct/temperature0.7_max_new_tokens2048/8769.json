  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the causal effects using the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), which transforms this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by the Laplace Transform without any modifications, will the absence of any poles of \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) in the left half of the complex plane indicate a purely oscillatory behavior in the time-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a function with a pole at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\). The absence of poles in the left half-plane (real part of s < 0) confirms that the signal does not exhibit exponential growth or decay, thus indicating purely oscillatory behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "angular frequency → signal z(t); signal z(t) → Laplace Transform; Laplace Transform → poles in the complex plane; poles in the complex plane → left half of the complex plane; left half of the complex plane → purely oscillatory behavior in the time-domain"
