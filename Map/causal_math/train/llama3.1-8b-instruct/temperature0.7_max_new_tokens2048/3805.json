  "Problem": "Given a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space, and the transformation defined by \\\\(T(f)(x) = f(x)e^{-x^2}\\\\), we consider the system's behavior when applying various operators or transformations simultaneously.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(f)(x)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(f_0(x)\\\\), and thereafter subjected to the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting function at some time point be the same as if \\\\(f_0(x)\\\\) was directly acted upon by \\\\(L\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(f)(x)\\\\) modifies the function by multiplying it with \\\\(e^{-x^2}\\\\), which then alters how the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acts on the function compared to its action on the original \\\\(f_0(x)\\\\). This change is not merely additive and changes the function's structure, influencing the outcome when \\\\(L\\\\) is applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
