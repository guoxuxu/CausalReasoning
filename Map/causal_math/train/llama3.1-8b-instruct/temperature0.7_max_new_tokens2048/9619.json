  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\). We examine the changes caused by performing a Laplace transformation on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) over time variable t, such that \\\\( L\\{z(w)\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w^2(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), assuming \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nIf a perturbing function \\\\( g(w) = w + C \\\\) for a constant matrix C is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution of \\\\( w(t) = e^{At} \\\\), will the final Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(w+C)\\}(s) \\\\) at any time T > t_1 depend solely on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(w) = w + C \\\\) alters the trajectory of the system by changing the state prior to applying \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\). Consequently, the endpoint of the Laplace transform will reflect influences from both A and C, altering the outcome depending on how C modifies the original path of \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
