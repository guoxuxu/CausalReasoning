  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to a linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We analyze the effect of an applied linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) could alter the initial condition in unknown ways unless specific information about \\\\( B \\\\) is known. Without this information, multiple potential initial states \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could evolve into the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under different applications of \\\\( B \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
