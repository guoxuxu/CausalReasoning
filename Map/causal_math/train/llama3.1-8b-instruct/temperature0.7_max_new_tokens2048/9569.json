  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\), where we transform the coordinates according to the functions \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = e^{Bt}y_0 \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. We analyze the dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\) over time under these transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are transformed from initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) according to the given exponential forms and evolved to a time T, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be greater than \\\\( z(0) \\\\) assuming both A and B are positive?",
  "Explanation": "Given A and B are positive, \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) exponentially increase over time. As both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) grow, their squares also increase, thus increasing \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) at time T compared to its initial value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
