  "Problem": "Consider the linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. Assess the effects of transforming the system with the operator \\\\( T(x) = Mx + N \\\\), where M and N are matrices and N is not necessarily zero.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without determining the application of the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\), which includes the unknown matrix N, we cannot accurately trace back from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The introduction of N means the initial conditions could have been shifted in an unknown way.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
