  "Problem": "Consider a function represented as a complex map \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a constant complex number. This map is used iteratively from an initial point z_0 in the complex plane to study its dynamic evolution.\n\nIf at some iteration \\\\( t_k \\\\) the function is changed to \\\\( h(z) = z^3 + c \\\\), will the resulting sequence's behavior completely disregard the initial function's effects (\\\\( g(z) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant behavior of the sequence is influenced by both the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) up to the iteration \\\\( t_k \\\\) and the new function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) applied thereafter. Hence, the effects of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) are not completely disregarded and play a role in the evolution of the sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant c influences the sequence's behavior through its effect on both the initial point z_0 and the function h(z), while the change in function from g(z) to h(z) at iteration t_k has no influence on the initial function's effects."
