  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The influence of an added Laplace transformation, defined by \\( f(z) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\), on the function \\( z(t) \\) is explored, where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a function \\( z_0(t) \\) at t = 0, and then \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve according to \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at T > 0 be the same as if \\( z_0(t) \\) had evolved under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform alters the frequency components of \\( z_0(t) \\) by transferring the function into the s-domain, which incorporates both growth and decay rates. This transformation changes the function's behavior fundamentally, and the resulting \\( z(t) \\) is not the same as would be attained by direct evolution under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
