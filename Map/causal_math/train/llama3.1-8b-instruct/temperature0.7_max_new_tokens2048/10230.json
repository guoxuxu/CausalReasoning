  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the influence of a transform \\\\( g(t) = t * f(t) \\\\) and its Laplace equivalent \\\\( G(s) = -F'(s) \\\\) on different situations.\n\nKnowing \\\\( G(s) = -F'(s) \\\\), can we unambiguously deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) after observing the modified system output \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without any knowledge of \\\\( t * f(t) \\\\) having been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is obscured by its transformation into \\\\( G(s) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge that the transformation involved multiplication by t, the derivative in the Laplace domain can correspond to multiple potential original functions due to the integration constant ambiguity in inverse transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
