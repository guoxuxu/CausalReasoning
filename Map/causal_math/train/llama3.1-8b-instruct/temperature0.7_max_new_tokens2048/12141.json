  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the Laplace Transform, \\\\( L(f)(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\. We apply the Laplace Transform to the exponential growth function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant. We then examine how an intervention using the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\), affects the transformed function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of the Laplace Transform, \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we definitively trace back and confirm the input function was \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) without knowing whether there was any Fourier Transform intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about intervention, the original function could have been modified by the Fourier Transform, potentially altering its form before the application of the Laplace Transform. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the exact original function solely based on the Laplace output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
