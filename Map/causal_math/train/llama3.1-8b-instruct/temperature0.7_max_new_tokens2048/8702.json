  "Problem": "Consider a vibrational system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\zeta \\\\) is the damping ratio and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the natural frequency. We study the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) = (e^{At}x, e^{At}\\\\dot{x}) \\\\), where A is a scalar.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( (x_0, \\\\dot{x}_0) \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( (x(t), \\\\dot{x}(t)) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\), the transformation by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) could have altered both position and velocity in a way that is not distinguishable at time T given the influence of the damping and natural frequency on the system's dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
