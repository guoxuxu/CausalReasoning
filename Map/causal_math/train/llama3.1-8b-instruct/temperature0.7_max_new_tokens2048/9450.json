  "Problem": "Let's explore a system involving a stochastic variable X following the distribution \\(f_X(x) = e^{-x}\\) for \\(x > 0\\) and the integral transform \\(T[X] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx} f_X(x) dx\\). We're interested in evaluating the implications of changing the parameter \\(t\\) within the transform, specifically for \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nGiven the output of \\(T[X]\\) for a known value of \\(t\\), is it possible to accurately backtrack and confirm whether \\(t\\) was initially set to 1 without extra information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about how \\(T[X]\\) behaved over time, determining if \\(t\\) started exactly at 1 only from the final output value can be uncertain since similar outputs may result from different initial and ongoing settings of \\(t\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
