  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( T(z(T)) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( R(z) \\), or both) were applied, only by knowing the value of \\( T(z(T)) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( T(z(T)) \\) could result from various combinations of \\( s \\) and \\( k \\) in the integral transformations \\( T(z) \\) and \\( R(z) \\). The overlap in possible effects and the integral nature make it impossible to distinctly identify which transformations were used based solely on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
