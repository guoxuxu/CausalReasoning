  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Fourier Transform applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, which is then subjected to operations described by a differential equation \\\\( L[g(x)] = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dx^2} - k^2g \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) from its Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) after solving the differential equation in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) in its solved form from the differential equation, the Inverse Fourier Transform can be applied to retrieve \\\\( g(x) \\\\). The solution in the frequency domain can be uniquely transformed back to the time or spatial domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
