  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system modeled using a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u\\\\), where L is a differential operator which includes non-linear terms. A Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx}f(x)dx\\\\) is applied to the initial condition to verify the impact on a function propagating through this system.\n\nObserving the function at time t = T, can we work backward to uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the initial application of the Fourier transform, and given the potentially non-linear nature of L, it is impossible to uniquely infer whether the original function had been transformed or not from the observed state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
