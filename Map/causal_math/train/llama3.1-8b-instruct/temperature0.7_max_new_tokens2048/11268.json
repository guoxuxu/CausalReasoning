  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), representing a Laplace transform of a time-domain function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). We explore how applying an integral transformation and its inverse affects our ability to infer causal relationships in the transformed domain.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and knowing an intervention was applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before the Laplace transform, can we precisely identify the nature and time of the intervention from \\\\( z(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform might indicate changes in the frequency domain, pinpointing the exact nature (what operation was applied) and the timing (when it was applied) of the intervention from \\\\( z(s) \\\\) alone is generally not feasible without additional information. The loss of time-specific information in the transformation to the s-domain contributes to this indeterminacy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
