  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an additional functional transformation \\\\( g(x) = Ux \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is a unitary matrix, on the eigenvalues of the vector \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) without further intervention, will the eigenvalues of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( U \\\\) is a unitary matrix, it preserves the eigenvalues of \\\\( x \\\\). Thus, the transformed vector still evolves with the same eigenvalues under \\\\( T \\\\), given that matrix multiplication is associative and \\\\( U \\\\) does not change eigenvalues.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
