  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We look into the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x) dx \\\\) to the function u(x, t) and analyzing its effect over time t.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, T)) \\\\), can we uniquely recover \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) using the Fourier transform and under the dynamics \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is invertible and assuming proper conditions on L (like decay properties or non-singular operator behavior), you can uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, T)) = e^{LT} \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) \\\\) by using the inverse Fourier transform and the inverse of \\\\( e^{LT} \\\\).",
