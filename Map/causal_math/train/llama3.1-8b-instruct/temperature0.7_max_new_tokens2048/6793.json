  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = T^{-1}e^{Dt}Tx \\\\) is considered, where T is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the starting vector, altering the trajectory under the system's dynamics. Since \\\\( h(x) \\\\) applies an exponential operation that modifies the phases and growth rates different components of \\\\( x \\\\), the state at time T will generally be different unless \\\\( T^{-1}e^{Dt}T \\\\) commutes with \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
