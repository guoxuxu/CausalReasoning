  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant complex number. Study the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nCan we accurately trace back to the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the specific transformation applied \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition in such a way that it might incorporate transformations of the integral over time, encompassing phase shifts and scaling influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of these transformations, reconstructing the original \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is not feasible due to the loss of initial phase information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
