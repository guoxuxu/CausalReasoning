  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), and A and B are scalar constants. We explore causal relationships under the Fourier transform defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nCan we determine explicitly what interventions were applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), given only the transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\) encodes information about the frequency content and general trends affected by interventions, but it does not provide explicit details about which interventions (scaling, shifts, etc.) were applied, due to the loss of specifics about time-domain interaction details.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
