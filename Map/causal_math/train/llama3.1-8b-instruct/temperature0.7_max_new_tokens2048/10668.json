  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is subject to a transformation using a linear time-invariant system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = Ay(t) + Bx(t) \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, and the transformation \\\\( h(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is a filter applied to the output signal, with C and D also being constant matrices.\n\nGiven the output at \\\\( T \\\\), can it be determined precisely whether the filtering \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k(t) \\\\) was used, or both, just by observing the output without additional contextual information?",
  "Explanation": "The superposition and potentially non-commutative effects of the filters \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( k(t) \\\\) along with the system's underlying dynamics make it challenging to distinguish and back-calculate exactly which filters were applied from the output alone. The overlap in potential state changes and transformations masks the unique characteristics of each intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
