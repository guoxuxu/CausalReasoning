  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the heat diffusion over a plane is studied. The temperature distribution is represented by the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), which satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. The experiment manipulates this distribution via a sudden localized heating at point \\\\( x_0 \\\\), represented by the function \\\\( \\\\delta(x - x_0) \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_0 \\\\), can it be concluded if the localized heating at \\\\( x_0 \\\\) occurred or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the existence or absence of the localized heating, observing the temperature distribution at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) does not definitively indicate whether the point source heating was applied due to potential similarities in temperature distributions resulting from different initial conditions or other disturbances.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
