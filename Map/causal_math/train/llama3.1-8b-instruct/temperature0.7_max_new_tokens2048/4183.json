  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), and a response function described by \\\\( R(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p} \\\\) where p is a positive constant. The system's output is obtained by the convolution operation in the time domain corresponding to multiplication in the Laplace domain. We study the influence of a feedback mechanism introduced via a transformation \\\\( g(y) = e^{-kt}y \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(y) = e^{-kt}y \\\\) is applied as an intervention at some time t1, will the transformed output still be solely characterizable by \\\\( R(s) \\\\) and independent of the intervention timing t1 for T > t1?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(y) = e^{-kt}y \\\\) modifies the decay rate and influence patterns in the time domain, which, through the correspondence in the Laplace domain, leads to a difference in the Laplace output that depends on the point of intervention t1. This changes the output's characteristics, thus making it dependent on how and when \\\\( g(y) \\\\) is applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
