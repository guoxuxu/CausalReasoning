  "Problem": "Analyzing a system under the influence of a complex function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), we examine the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The resultant transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) provides insights into the system's behavior in s-domain.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we conclusively infer that the original function was \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) without additional information about possible transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Although \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) is characteristically resultant from \\\\( e^{az} \\\\), the Laplace transform being a linear operator could imply other functions with similar structured impacts in the s-domain. Without specific details about transformations or combinations, multiple functions could yield the same transformed result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform → F(s); f(z) = e^{az} → F(s) = 1/(s-a); a → F(s) = 1/(s-a); F(s) → insights into the system's behavior"
