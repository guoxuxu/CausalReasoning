  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is defined as the Laplace transform. We examine the effects this transformation has on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) exactly after observing its frequency domain representation obtained via \\\\( L \\\\) without knowing \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the frequency domain representation from the Laplace transform, the constants \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the poles and residues of the transform, thus allowing full reconstruction of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
