  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is further studied under the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without additional intervention, does \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T equate to what would have been if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to t = T directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\). However, the continual growth factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) affects the magnitude and possibly the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), depending on the relationship between \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not simply be \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\) but rather \\\\( e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha)T}z_0 \\\\), differing significantly in both magnitude and phase.",
