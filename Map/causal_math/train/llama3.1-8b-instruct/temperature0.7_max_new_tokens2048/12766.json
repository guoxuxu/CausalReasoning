  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation \\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\) represented by matrix \\( M \\), and its impact on a complex function \\( z(t) \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}v \\), where \\( v \\) is a constant vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\) and \\( \\omega \\) a real number. We explore how the application of Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) and its subsequent inverse alter the original function.\n\nIf the Laplace transform and its inverse are applied as an intervention at some t > 0, will the resulted \\( z(t) \\) at any T > t strictly be a result of these transformations, unaffected by \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation and its inverse fundamentally alter the structure of \\( z(t) \\), but the initial application of \\( T \\) that transformed \\( v \\) to \\( Mv \\) still dictates how \\( z(t) \\) is initially defined. Hence, the overall behavior and resulting function \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by both \\( M \\) and the nature of the Laplace operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
