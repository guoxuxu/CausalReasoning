  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, complex matrix, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We analyze how the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a constant matrix, changes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nKnowing the terminal value \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and understanding that interventions \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) were applied, can we infer the exact times and matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex interactions and cumulative effects between the exponential mappings of matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), multiple configurations of \\\\( t_1 \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) may lead to similar or identical results at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without additional information, these parameters cannot be uniquely determined based only on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
