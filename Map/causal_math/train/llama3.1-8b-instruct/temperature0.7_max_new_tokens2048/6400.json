  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) with \\( \\lambda > 0 \\), and consider the transformation \\( T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t} \\) applied to \\( u \\).\n\nGiven \\( u(x, T) \\) under repeated applications of \\( T(u) \\), can we deduce the exact times \\( t_i \\) when \\( T(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The result of applying \\( T(u) \\) repeatedly produces a state that masks the effects of \\( -\\lambda u \\), making it indistinguishable when during the timeline the interventions occurred just from observing \\( u(x, T) \\). The end state could be consistent with various sequences and timings of applying \\( T(u) \\), particularly without additional information on the dynamics between the intervals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
