  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform on a function representing vector components \\\\( v(t) \\), where \\\\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\\\).\n\nFrom the frequency composition of \\\\( v(T) \\\\) at time T, can we reconstruct the vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing that a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) on the frequency components of \\\\( v_0 \\\\) complicates back-calculating to \\\\( v_0 \\\\). Without knowing the initial application of the Fourier transform, such reconstruction might miss or misinterpret the original basis represented by \\\\( v_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → frequency composition; Linear transformation → frequency composition; Linear transformation → vector v(T); frequency composition → vector v(T); vector v(T) → vector v_0"
