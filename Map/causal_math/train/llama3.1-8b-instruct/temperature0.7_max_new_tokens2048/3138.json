  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is used to modify the initial conditions of a particle's state in a quantum system described by \\\\( \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is a unitary time evolution operator.\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\( \\psi_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\psi(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(w) \\\\) was applied at the outset?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the phase factor by \\\\( g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\) at the initial time could result in multiple potential initial states depending on the value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the specific time of observation T. Determining \\\\( \\psi_0 \\\\) uniquely without knowing the phase manipulation is therefore impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
