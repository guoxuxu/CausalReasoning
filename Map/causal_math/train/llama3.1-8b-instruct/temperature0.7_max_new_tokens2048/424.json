  "Problem": "Given a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( x \\\\) is a spatial variable. The function is initially defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = (K * f)(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f \\\\) is an initial function. We study how the transformation evolves under the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient.\n\nCan we determine precisely what initial and intervention transformations were used (i.e., the kernels \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\)) just by observing the function \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusion process combined with multiple kernel transformations results in a complex interaction that can conceal the effects of individual kernels, especially when multiple configurations of \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\) could lead to similar outcomes at time \\\\( T \\\\). Therefore, it is not possible to precisely identify both kernels based solely on the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\).",
