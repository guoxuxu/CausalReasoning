  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) being a function evolving under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. Consider the role of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and how it interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nBy observing \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) after the intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine whether the modified dynamics were due to \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) will generally reveal alterations in the frequency domain but cannot definitively disclose whether changes were due to the original dynamics under \\\\( P \\\\), solely due to \\\\( Q \\\\), or a combination. This is due to the linear superposition in differential equations and potential overlap in frequency effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
