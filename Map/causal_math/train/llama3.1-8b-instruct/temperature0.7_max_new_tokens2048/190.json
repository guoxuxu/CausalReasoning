  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit containing an RLC (Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor) series circuit driven by a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V0 * sin(ωt). The relationship between the input voltage and current is governed by the differential equation L*d^2I/dt^2 + R*dI/dt + (1/C)*I = dV/dt, where I is the current, L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven measurements of the output current I(t) with a changed input voltage, can we determine if the original input was sine or cosine solely based on the current waveform, assuming initial conditions were unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial conditions or precise timings when the waveform was sampled, distinguishing between a sine and cosine input based solely on steady state currents is challenging. This is due to similarity in functional forms and the possibility of phase lags introduced by circuit properties themselves masking the original source form.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
