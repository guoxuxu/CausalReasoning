  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the system \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t)\\\\), with P being a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(z) = Qz \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be reliably deduced after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly back-calculate to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the transformation \\\\( Q \\\\) might have altered the initial state in a way that is indistinguishable solely from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
