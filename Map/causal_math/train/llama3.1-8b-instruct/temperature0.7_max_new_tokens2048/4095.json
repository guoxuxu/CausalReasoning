  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is an operator. We examine the behavior under the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nIf a perturbation using another operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), changing the system to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = (L+M)u\\\\), will the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) be independent of the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\( M \\\\) changes the system dynamics starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the effects of the initial Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) may interact non-trivially with this new operator. As a result, both the initial transform and the interaction between \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) determine the state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
