  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) acting on a function space, defined as \\( L[f](x) = \\int_0^x k(x, t) f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a kernel function. We analyze the impact of a multiplying factor \\( g(x) \\) on the function \\( f(x) \\) before applying the operator.\n\nGiven \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\), can we deduce precisely whether \\( h(x) \\) was formed by multiplying \\( f(x) \\) with \\( g(x) \\) or if \\( g(x) \\) was applied after applying \\( L \\) to \\( f(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\) does not retain separate information about the functions \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) that can be distinctly recovered, especially since the integral transformation mixes the effects of \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) with the kernel \\( k \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
