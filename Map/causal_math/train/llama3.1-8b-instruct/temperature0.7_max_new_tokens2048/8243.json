  "Problem": "Consider a vector field \\( V \\) in a complex domain, represented as \\( V(z) = u(z) + iv(z) \\) where \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are real-valued functions of the complex variable \\( z \\). We examine the situation where an integral transform \\( T \\), particularly the Laplace Transform, is applied to \\( V \\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied where \\( V \\) is modified by a complex function \\( h(z) = e^{az} \\) at a point \\( z_1 \\), will the outcome of \\( T(V)(s) \\) at a later point depend exclusively on the original unmodified characteristics of \\( V \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( h(z) \\) modifies \\( V \\) at \\( z_1 \\), potentially altering the entire subsequent trajectory of \\( V \\) and therefore affecting the result of \\( T(V)(s) \\). The transformed state reflects changes due to both the original characteristics of \\( V \\) and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
