  "Problem": "We consider a system operating under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) models a physical phenomenon (e.g., heat distribution over time), and we explore scenarios where transformations and interventions occur, such as multiplying by a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we exactly determine the time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) if we don't know whether the time-domain function was multiplied by \\\\( t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of information about the pre-transformation (whether \\\\( t^2 \\\\) was included or not) makes it impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( f(t) \\\\). This ambiguity stems from different possible functions yielding the same transformed result under different multiplication factors (like \\\\( t^2 \\\\)).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace Transform → F(s); F(s) → f(t); Multiplication by g(t) → f(t); t^2 → f(t); f(t) → Multiplication by t^2"
