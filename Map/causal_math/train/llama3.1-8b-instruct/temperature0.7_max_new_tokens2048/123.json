  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its impact when applied to a function described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The study will examine how transformations and temporal evolutions based on these mathematical relations affect causal inferences.\n\nSuppose an intervention modifies \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) at some point \\\\( z_1 \\\\). Will the result of the system at \\\\( z_2 > z_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( b \\\\) and not on the previous parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention shifting \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) alters the trajectory of \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) from \\\\( e^{-az} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{-bz} \\\\), beginning at \\\\( z_1 \\\\). The result at \\\\( z_2 \\\\) will depend on both the history of the system (dominated by \\\\( a \\\\) up to \\\\( z_1 \\\\)) and the impact of the new parameter \\\\( b \\\\). Hence, the system's state reflects both parameters over time.",
