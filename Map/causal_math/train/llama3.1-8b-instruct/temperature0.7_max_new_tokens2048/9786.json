  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively. Here, A and B are real constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is considered in the analysis.\n\nKnowing \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at T, can we uniquely recover the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it evolved from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) aggregates the values over time, losing individual time point information about \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The inversion to recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is not uniquely determinable without additional constraints or information about the behavior of A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
