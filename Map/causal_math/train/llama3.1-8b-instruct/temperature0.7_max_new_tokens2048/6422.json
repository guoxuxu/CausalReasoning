  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the equation of motion is derived from the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + v(x) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is momentum, \\\\( m \\\\) is mass, and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is a potential energy function. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to the position function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nCan the original waveform \\\\( x(0) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) be exactly determined from the Fourier Transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) observed at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), assuming no knowledge of intermediate states?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) contains only frequency-domain information at time T, and without additional temporal information or details about the potential energy function, reconstructing the exact state of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) is not possible due to the potential complexity and non-reversibility in the evolution under the Hamiltonian.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
