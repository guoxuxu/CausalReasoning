  "Problem": "Consider the system described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). The system is analyzed for the impact of multiplying by a polynomial function \\\\( p(t) = t^k \\\\) and then taking the Laplace transform again. Here, \\\\( k \\\\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nGiven \\\\( H(s) \\\\), the transform of \\\\( h(t) = t^k g(t) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) without the value of \\\\( k \\\\) does not uniquely specify \\\\( g(t) \\\\) because the differentiation of order \\\\( k \\\\) in the transform domain (which derives from the multiplication by \\\\( t^k \\\\) in the time domain) is essential for correctly inverting the transform to recover \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
