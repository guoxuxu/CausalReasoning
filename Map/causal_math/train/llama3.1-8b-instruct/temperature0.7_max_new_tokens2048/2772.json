  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\\\\), which defines the Laplace Transform of a time-domain function \\\\(f(t)\\\\). We explore how the application of a multiplier function \\\\(g(t) = e^{at}\\\\) affects this transformation, where \\\\(a\\\\) is a real number.\n\nKnowing only the final result \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s-a-b)\\\\), can we resolve whether the transformations \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{bt}\\\\) were applied successively or singly as a product, based only on \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end result, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s-a-b)\\\\), is symmetrical with respect to applications of \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) followed by \\\\(e^{bt}\\\\) or the combined effect \\\\(e^{(a+b)t}\\\\) directly, without revealing the sequence of their applications. Thus, one cannot uniquely identify the individual contributions or their sequence based only on final transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
