  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) represented in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are complex constants. The impact of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) is considered, where R is also a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) (where S is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on P and not on R or S?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another complex exponential factor, modifying the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the interaction and cumulative effects of R, S, and P.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
