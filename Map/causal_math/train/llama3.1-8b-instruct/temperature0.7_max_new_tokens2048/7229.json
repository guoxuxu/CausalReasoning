  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nIf the Laplace transformation is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) without any intervention, does the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) solely depend on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), calculated as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{i \\\\omega t}) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\), depends exclusively on the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\). There are no other variables or parameters involved in this transformation under the given conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
