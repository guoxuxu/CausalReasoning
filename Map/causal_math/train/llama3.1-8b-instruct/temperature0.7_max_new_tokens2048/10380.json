  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) representing the Laplace transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) models a physical system's response to an input signal, and we explore the effects of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with a convolution operation using another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) be accurately determined solely from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) after knowing that convolution with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the knowledge of convolution, the determination of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) cannot be solely done as \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\). Deconvolution requires additional information not provided by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone, showing dependence on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
