  "Problem": "Analyze a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct} z \\\\) over time t, with C being a constant matrix, is considered.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Ct}z_0 \\\\) at t=0, which evolves differently under the influences of A and B compared to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the possible non-commutative effects of matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) with A and B, leading to a potentially different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
