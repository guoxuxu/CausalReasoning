  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and z is a complex-valued function of time t. Investigate the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is another real constant, on the evolution of z.\n\nIf at some time t = t_1 the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-kt}z \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the state at time T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) essentially attempts to counteract or undo the scaling effect of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), but the overall impact depends on the precise timings and magnitudes of t_1 and T. The interactions between the growth factors introduced by k and the rotational dynamics introduced by i\\\\omega result in a trajectory that is dependent on both parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
