  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\) where \\( f(t) \\) is a time-dependent function and \\( s \\) is a complex variable. We analyze the causal influence of multiplying \\( f(t) \\) by a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nBased on the transformed function \\( F'(s) \\), can you determine whether the original function \\( f(t) \\) was multiplied by a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) without knowing \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "If only \\( F'(s) \\) is known, the original \\( \\omega \\) value used in the exponential multiplication cannot be uniquely determined without additional information. Multiple values of \\( \\omega \\) could yield similar alterations in \\( F'(s) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
