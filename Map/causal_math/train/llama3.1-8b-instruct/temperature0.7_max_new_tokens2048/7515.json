  "Problem": "Examine the effects of altering the matrix in the linear transformation \\\\(T(v) = Av\\\\) on vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix. Consider the new transformation given by \\\\(f(v) = (A+D)v\\\\) after a perturbation matrix \\\\(D\\\\) is added. Assume both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nIf a different matrix \\\\(E\\\\) is introduced as an intervention at \\\\(t_1\\\\), applying a new function \\\\(g(v) = (A+E)v\\\\), will the final state \\\\(v(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the original matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and not on \\\\(D\\\\) or \\\\(E\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(E\\\\) as an intervention partway through the system's evolution adds complexity to the trajectory. The final state \\\\(v(T)\\\\) thus depends on all matrices involved: \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\). The combination of these matrices' effects influences the system's path and endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
