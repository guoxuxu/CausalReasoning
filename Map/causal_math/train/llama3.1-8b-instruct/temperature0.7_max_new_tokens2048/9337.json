  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) concerning the spatial variable x.\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to obtain \\\\( U(s, 0) \\\\) and the heat equation is allowed to evolve \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) naturally, will \\\\( U(s, t) \\\\) at time t be equivalent to simply evolving \\\\( U(s, 0) \\\\) under some transformation based on \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) converts the heat equation into an ordinary differential equation in the Laplace transform space: \\\\( \\\\frac{dU}{dt} = -ks^2 U(s, t) \\\\). Thus, starting from \\\\( U(s, 0) \\\\) and evolving it under this transformed equation indeed yields \\\\( U(s, t) \\\\), which corresponds to the application of the Laplace transform to the naturally evolved heat distribution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
