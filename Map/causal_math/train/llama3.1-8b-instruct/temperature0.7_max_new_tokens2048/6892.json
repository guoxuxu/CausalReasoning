  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the times and nature of any interventions (changes in the PDE parameters) used, if any?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform at T could result from various scenarios of parameter changes at different times, as long as the combined effect conforms to the observed \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\). Without additional information about the specific timing and nature of interventions, they cannot be uniquely identified.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
