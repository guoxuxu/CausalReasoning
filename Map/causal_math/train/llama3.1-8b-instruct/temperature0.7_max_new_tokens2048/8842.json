  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -kx\\\\), with a constant decay rate k. The impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\(L[f(t)](s)\\\\) on this system is explored, where \\\\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\\\). The transformation variable s is complex.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(L[f(t)](s)\\\\) of the system, can we uniquely recover the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and the constant k without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\frac{x_0}{s+k}\\\\), and from this form, one can uniquely determine the decay constant k and the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\) directly from the parameters in the transformed expression.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
