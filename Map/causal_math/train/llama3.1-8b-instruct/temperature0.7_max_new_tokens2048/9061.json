  "Problem": "We analyze a heat equation \\(\\partial u/\\partial t = \\alpha \\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2\\) for a rod initially subject to a temperature distribution \\(u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) with \\(\\alpha > 0\\). Let's evaluate the effects of applying a Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine component.\n\nIf at \\(t = 0\\), the Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s(u(x, 0)) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) is applied without further transformation, will the temperature distribution \\(u(x, t)\\) at a later time \\(t = T > 0\\) be different from direct evolution under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine components leaves the initial condition unchanged as \\(\\mathcal{F}_s(\\sin(\\pi x)) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\). Therefore, the temperature evolves solely based on the original heat equation, unchanged by the transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
