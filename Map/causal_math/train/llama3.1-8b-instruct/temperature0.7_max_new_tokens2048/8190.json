  "Problem": "We study a vector field \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by two processes: multiplication by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iwt}z \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) applied over time. We aim to understand how these transformations impact \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after applying \\\\( F(z) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied during the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) means we cannot accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the phase alteration caused by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could correspond to different initial vectors that, once transformed by \\\\( F \\\\), yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
