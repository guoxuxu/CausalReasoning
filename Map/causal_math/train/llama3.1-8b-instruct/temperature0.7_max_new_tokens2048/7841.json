  "Problem": "Examine a control system defined by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix and \\(D\\) is the control input matrix. The analysis covers the impact of a non-linear transformation \\( h(x) = \\sin(Kt) x \\) on the system's state \\(x\\), over time \\(t\\), where \\(K\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be identical to simply evolving \\( x_0 \\) to t = T under \\(\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( h(x) \\) modifies the initial condition through a sinusoidal scaling factor, altering the trajectory from the outset. As the nonlinear sinusoidal function can affect how the state responses to the control dynamics represented by \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), the trajectory and thus \\( x(T) \\) are different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
