  "Problem": "Analyzing the role of the Laplace Transform in solving differential equations, consider a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined as \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) of a function y(t) is applied to convert this ODE into the algebraic equation in s-domain.\n\nIf the initial conditions y(0) and y'(0) are set and then the ODE is solved using the Laplace Transform without further intervention, will the solution y(t) for any t > 0 directly depend on the chosen initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of the ODE incorporates the initial conditions into the transformed equation, thus directly affecting the inverse transform y(t). Hence, y(t) for any t > 0 is uniquely determined by the initial conditions y(0) and y'(0).",
