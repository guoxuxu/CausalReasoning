  "Problem": "Analyze the causal impact on a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), governed by a set of coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du\\\\), where A, B, C, D are matrices and u is a control function. We explore the system's behavior as influenced by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original differential equations and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or the form of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity and modification, causing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to also depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) along with the interaction effects between the transformation and the original system matrices (A, B, C, D). \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega t} \\\\) effectively counters or alters the initial transformation, impacting the resulting trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
