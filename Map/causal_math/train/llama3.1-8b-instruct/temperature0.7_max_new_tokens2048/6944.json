  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is subjected to an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\), evaluating the Laplace transform of the function.\n\nGiven the final result after performing transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and observing it at t = T, can we specifically identify all the transformations applied (both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\)) only by examining the output?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed result is a mix of effects from both transformations, each contributing to the outcome in a way that does not allow for straightforward back-calculation of either transformation parameters, \\\\( s \\\\) in \\\\( T \\\\), or the exact nature of \\\\( U \\\\). The overlapping effects and complex interaction of parameters make it impossible to definitively identify the transformations from the output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
