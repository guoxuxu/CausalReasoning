  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in complex function theory, defined by the equation \\\\(Ax = \\\\lambda x\\\\), where A is a linear operator on a complex vector space, and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are the eigenvalues. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt\\\\) on the eigenvalues.\n\nCan we infer the initial operator A just by analyzing the eigenvalues of the system after transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\), without knowing the specifics of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The eigenvalues derived from the transformed system under \\\\(T(x)\\\\) are a result of both the integral transformation and the original nature of A. Without clear knowledge of the transformation specifics, particularly \\\\(e^{At}\\\\)'s integration, it is practically infeasible to disentangle A's contribution accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
