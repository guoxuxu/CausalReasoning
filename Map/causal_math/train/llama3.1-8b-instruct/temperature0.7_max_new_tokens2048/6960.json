  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, and A and B are constant matrices. We investigate the effects of applying the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final complex state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( R(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely from the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and commutation properties of exponential matrices, different combinations or sequences of interventions (\\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( R(z) \\\\)) might result in identical or indistinguishable outcomes at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This ambiguity precludes determining the specific nature and sequence of interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
