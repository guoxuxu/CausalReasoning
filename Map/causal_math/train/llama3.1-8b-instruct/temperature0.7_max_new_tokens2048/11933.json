  "Problem": "A two-dimensional linear system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) represents a rotation. We examine the effect of the function \\\\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t, where \\\\( B = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), which also results in a rotational transformation.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we determine the exact initial state \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was applied, considering no additional knowledge about B?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirming the application of the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\), it’s impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( y_0 \\\\) because the added rotation by B could align the system into a state indistinguishable at T from one that evolved under \\\\( A \\\\) alone. The lack of information on B’s characteristics (like rotational speed or phase changes) prevents reversing the state unequivocally.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
