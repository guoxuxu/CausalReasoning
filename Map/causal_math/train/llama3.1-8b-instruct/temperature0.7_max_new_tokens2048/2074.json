  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation on a complex function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\\\), where the integral is taken over a suitable contour in the complex plane. We explore how the transformation affects the inversion of the function via the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(z) \\\\), can we always uniquely recover the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) using the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming no information is lost during the transformation and the conditions for the Laplace transform are adhered to, the inverse Laplace transform can uniquely recover \\\\( g(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(z) \\\\). This recovery is subject to the conditions such as linearity and the continuity of the integrand.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
