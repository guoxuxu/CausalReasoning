  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the impact of altering this system using a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nSuppose at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention using a different function \\\\(k(x) = Mx\\\\) (where \\\\(M\\\\) is also an invertible matrix) is applied. Will the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), for T > \\\\(t_1\\\\), depend solely on \\\\(D\\\\) and not on \\\\(S\\\\) or \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome at \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will result from the sequential impact of both transformations, \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and \\\\(k(x)\\\\), along with the dynamics driven by \\\\(D\\\\). Consequently, the endpoint depends on the matrices \\\\(S\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), and their relationship with \\\\(D\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
