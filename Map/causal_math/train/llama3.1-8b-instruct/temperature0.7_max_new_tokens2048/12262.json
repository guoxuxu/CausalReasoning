  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the differential equation to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Qz \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) after initially applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) with \\\\( s \\\\), will the behaviour of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) at \\\\( s' \\\\) be predictable solely based on the new coefficient \\\\( Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention and coefficient change to \\\\( Q \\\\) adds a new dynamic to how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves, impacting the Laplace transform's result in a manner dependent on both \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) and their relation to the parameters \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( s' \\\\). The outcome at \\\\( s' \\\\) may exhibit characteristics influenced by both original and modified dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
