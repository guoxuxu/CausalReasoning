  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where initial data points are mapped in a complex plane according to the function \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( i \\\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant, and \\\\\\( t \\\\\\) is time. We examine the effect of another transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\\\) introduced as an intervention, where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) is not applied and the data points evolve solely under \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\) over time \\\\\\( t \\\\\\), will the magnitude of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\) only involves rotation of the vector \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) in the complex plane, maintaining its magnitude. The scalar magnitude is not affected by the rotational motion about the origin, thus remaining constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
