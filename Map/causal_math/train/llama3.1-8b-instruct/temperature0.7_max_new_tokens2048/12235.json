  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an unknown time-domain function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its image in the complex frequency domain. The effect of a complex function \\\\( G(s) = s^2 + 1 \\\\) is to transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) into \\\\( G(s)F(s) \\\\) representing a modification in the frequency domain.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{H(s)G(s)F(s)\\\\} \\\\) at a time t, can we accurately decipher if only \\\\( H(s) \\\\), only \\\\( G(s) \\\\), or both were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state after multiple transformations, it is challenging to definitively backtrack and identify each specific transformation applied during the evolution. The modifications induced by \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) are both reflected in the final state, making it unclear which transformations were specifically used or their sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
