  "Problem": "Assume we have a function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\). Also, suppose an integral transformation of this function using a contour in the complex plane specified as \\\\(T[f(z)] = \\\\int_C f(z) dz\\\\) where C is a semicircular contour from -R to R in the upper half-plane.\n\nGiven the result of the integral transformation \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\), can we infer the exact value of the radius R of the contour C without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral transformation \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\) depends on both the form of the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and the path of integration C. Without specific information about how the integrand behaves on this path or additional boundary conditions, the radius R cannot be uniquely determined from the integral result alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
