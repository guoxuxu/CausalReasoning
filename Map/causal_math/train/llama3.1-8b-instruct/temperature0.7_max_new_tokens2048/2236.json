  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we determine if the transformation was applied, and identify the specific parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), based solely on observing the Laplace transform result \\\\(T[g](s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the function after intervention, \\\\(T[g](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - (a + i\\\\omega)}\\\\), allows for identification of the real part which corresponds to \\\\(a\\\\) and the imaginary part which is \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). These parameters can be uniquely determined from the function's pole in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
