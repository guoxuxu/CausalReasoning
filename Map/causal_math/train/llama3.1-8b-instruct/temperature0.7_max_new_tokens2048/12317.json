  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} - ci \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are real constants.\n\nFrom observing the final function at \\\\( t = T \\\\) having applied \\\\( D \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the differential operator adding a complex component, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could correspond to various initial conditions due to the phase modification introduced by \\\\( -ci \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\). The modifications obscure the original conditions unless exactly knowing all operator components and initial phase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
