  "Problem": "Analyze a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a matrix representing the system's dynamics. We consider the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial state, which alters the state's frequency components.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at a certain time T, can we determine whether a Fourier transform or the corrective transformation \\\\(H\\\\), or both were applied based solely on \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or type of interventions based solely on the observed state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) is highly challenging. Different initial transforms and corrective measures can result in the same state at T due to the linearity and transformative properties of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and \\\\(H\\\\). Such ambiguities in linear transformations prevent unique inversion from effect back to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
