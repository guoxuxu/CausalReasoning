  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(s) u(s, t) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(s) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nGiven the observed transformed output \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what interventions (variations like \\\\( M(u) \\\\) and applications of \\\\( T \\\\)) were applied, solely based on the final observed value?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time T could result from different initial conditions and interventions due to the integration process masking details about the original state and the subsequent modifications. Without additional information, distinct interventions may yield similar transformed outputs, making specific determinations impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transform T and the linear differential operator L are the direct causes of u and ∂u/∂t, respectively."
