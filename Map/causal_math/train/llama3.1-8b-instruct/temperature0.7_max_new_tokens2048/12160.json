  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation via a linear operator represented by an integral transformation \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\int h(t - \\tau)f(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response function. The output after transformation is denoted \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is altered by adding a distortion effect represented as \\\\( g(t) = x(t) + \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) and processed without any other interventions, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as processing the unaltered signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) alters the input signal and consequently the output due to the linear nature of \\\\( T[f(t)] \\\\). The transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) will yield a different output involving the integral transform of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\), thus changing the system's response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
