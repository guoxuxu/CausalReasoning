  "Problem": "Considering a controlled experiment involving the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a system of differential equations with matrices M and N respectively: \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\). The experiment examines the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), where K is a constant scalar, on the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) not only affects the initial condition but also modifies how \\\\( z \\\\) evolves by introducing a rotation dependent on K. Even though the differential equations governing \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) remain the same, the path taken by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is altered due to the complex exponential factor, leading to a different outcome at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
