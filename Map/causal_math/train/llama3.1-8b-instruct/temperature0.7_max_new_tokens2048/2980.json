  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equations set \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + b\\\\) where A is a linear operator and b is a constant vector. An integral transformation is defined by \\\\( f(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) for a time period T.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at time T, can one deduce all the interventions applied (changes in A to D, and b to c), knowing only the final state \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral accumulation of the effects over time, multiple different interventions (or series of changes to A, b and introducing D, c) could yield the same endpoint \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Without a clear trace of how the system's dynamics were altered at each point in time, it's not feasible to uniquely backtrack all changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
