  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) as matrices. We explore the role of a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that modifies the input \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by the function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\).\n\nIf after observing the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the precise original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( M \\\\), one cannot accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation could alter the starting conditions distinctly. The presence or absence of \\\\( M \\\\) and its specific characteristics (like its eigenvalues and eigenvectors) directly influence the original state inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
