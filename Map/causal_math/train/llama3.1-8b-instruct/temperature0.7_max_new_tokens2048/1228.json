  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to \\\\(u\\\\), resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), and its subsequent evolution.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at T, can we determine precisely whether the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform, or both were applied, just by analyzing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of multiple transformations (Fourier, Laplace) and their differing effects on the initial conditions make it challenging to determine exactly which transforms were applied merely from the final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\). The transformations could produce overlapping or indistinguishable effects in the frequency domain, thus obscuring their individual contributions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
