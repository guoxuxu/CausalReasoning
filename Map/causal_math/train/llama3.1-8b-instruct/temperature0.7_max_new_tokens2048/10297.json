  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to transform the contour of integration in the complex plane for an integral \\\\(I = \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), where \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is a holomorphic function and \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple closed contour.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to the contour \\\\( C \\\\) without further modification, does the value of the integral \\\\( I' = \\\\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) remain equal to the original integral \\\\( I \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) to the contour \\\\( C \\\\) changes the path of integration in the complex plane, possibly encompassing different poles or excluding original ones, thus altering the value of the integral unless specific conditions on \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( f(z) \\\\) are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
