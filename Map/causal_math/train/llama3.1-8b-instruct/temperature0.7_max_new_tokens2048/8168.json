  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We analyze how the integral transformation \\\\(X(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, influences the state over time.\n\nUsing the end state \\\\(X(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine precisely what transformations (original or due to interventions) were applied if we only know the final state and no other history?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and potential overlap in the dynamics introduced by \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and any intervening transformations like the switch from \\\\(C\\\\) to \\\\(D\\\\), it is impossible to definitively ascertain the specific sequences or types of transformations used only by observing \\\\(X(T)\\\\). The integral transformation obscures direct causal pathways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
