  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of modifying \\\\( s \\\\) and using an intervention function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( S(z) \\\\) with a specific \\\\( s \\\\) is applied to the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the system evolves without further intervention, will the outcome \\\\( S(z) \\\\) be solely determined by the initial \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that no additional transformation or parameter alteration occurs post initial application, the output \\\\( S(z) \\\\) will be uniquely determined by \\\\( s \\\\) and the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), operated through the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
