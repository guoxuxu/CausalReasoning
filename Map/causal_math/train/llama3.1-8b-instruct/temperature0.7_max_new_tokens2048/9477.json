  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\). The relationship between input and output is governed by the differential equation \\\\( V'(t) = \\\\frac{1}{C}I(t) - \\\\frac{1}{RC}V(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. We examine scenarios where a Laplace transform operation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( I(t) \\\\) to analyze the system.\n\nIf the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(I)(s) \\\\) to analyze the system, and then \\\\( V(t) \\\\) evolves according to the original differential equation without further intervention, will the in-circuit behavior of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) match the analysis?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform to the input current for analysis does not alter the physical current entering the circuit. Thus, real-time behavior of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) will not be affected by this mathematical operation, but the analytical solutions might differ if used to predict physical responses without considering inverse transformations or initial conditions correctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
