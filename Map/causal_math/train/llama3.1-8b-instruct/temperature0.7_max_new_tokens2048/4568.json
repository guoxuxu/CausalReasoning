  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical model where an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A and s are scalars indicating the rate constants.\n\nKnowing \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\) after some unknown interventions, can we determine specifically what modifications were applied to the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If interventions alter the function in a time-dependent manner, the unique determination of which or how many transformations (like \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\)) were applied isn’t feasible based solely on \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\) due to the overlapping effects and infinite possible combinations of such transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
