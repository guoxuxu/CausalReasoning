  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{tt} = -\\Delta u + \\lambda u \\\\), where \\\\( \\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a scalar parameter. We explore the effect of an initial condition manipulation described by \\\\( u(0,x) = \\phi(x) \\\\) and an impulse transformation \\\\( u_t(0,x) = \\psi(x) \\\\), where \\\\(\\phi(x)\\\\) and \\\\(\\psi(x)\\\\) are specific functions.\n\nIf \\\\( u(0,x) = \\phi(x) \\\\) and \\\\( u_t(0,x) = \\psi(x) \\\\) are set as initial conditions without further external influences, will the state \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) for T > 0 be solely determined by \\\\(\\phi(x)\\\\) and \\\\(\\psi(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's future states depend entirely on its initial conditions and independent parameters under the governing differential equation. Given \\\\(\\phi(x)\\\\) and \\\\(\\psi(x)\\\\), the solution \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\) at any time T can be uniquely determined from the wave equation's solution formulation with these initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
