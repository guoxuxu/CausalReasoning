  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The function is analyzed in terms of its effects on integration along a contour in the complex plane. The path of integration, \\\\( C \\\\), is defined from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing only the final value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) G(z) dz \\\\) after the intervention, can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( Z \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\), or both) were used throughout \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end value of an integral involving complex exponential functions, like \\\\( Z \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\), can result from various combinations and modifications along \\\\( C \\\\). Without additional information about the interventions or the path, determining exactly the transformations used is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
