  "Problem": "Let's consider the probability density function \\( p(z) \\) that describes the distribution of a random variable \\( Z \\) undergoing the Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(z)e^{-i\\omega z} dz \\). We investigate how transformations in the time domain and frequency domain affect this PDF.\n\nIf \\( p(z) \\) is modified to \\( q(z) = p(z - a) \\) for a shift \\( a \\), and then undergoes a Fourier Transform, will \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) \\) at frequency \\( \\omega \\) be the same as \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\) without the shift?",
  "Explanation": "The shift transformation \\( q(z) = p(z - a) \\) in the time domain corresponds to a phase shift in the frequency domain. Specifically, \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) = e^{-i\\omega a} \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\), which means the Fourier Transform is multiplied by a phase factor that depends on \\( a \\) and \\( \\omega \\), altering the original transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
