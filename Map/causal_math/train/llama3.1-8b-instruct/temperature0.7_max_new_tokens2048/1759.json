  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, and no further interventions are applied, will the transformed Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in such a way that its subsequent evolution and its Laplace transform will depend on the nature of \\\\( f \\\\) and not just on \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\), thereby affecting the outcomes and characteristics of \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
