  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) interacting with a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants. An influence is applied through a Fourier Transform defined by \\\\( G(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\omega^2} \\\\). We are interested in the system's behavior after consecutive transformations.\n\nWithout external intervention, if the system is initially influenced by the Laplace transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\), then transformed by \\\\( F(z) \\\\), will the resultant transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) still be expressible purely in terms of \\\\( L(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of complex function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) onto the Laplace domain modifies the system's response. The transformation combines the properties of both \\\\( L(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(z) \\\\), creating a new resultant transform that cannot be described simply by \\\\( L(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
