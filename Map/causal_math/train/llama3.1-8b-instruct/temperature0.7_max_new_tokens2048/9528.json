  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the function V(x), and governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\). We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(x)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\xi x} x(t) dt \\\\) on the trajectory of the particle.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), after knowing that an external potential U was introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely whether a Fourier transformation was applied at t = 0 only by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the initial Fourier transformation and the introduction of a new potential U makes it difficult to uniquely ascertain the influence of the Fourier transformation alone. Both actions modify trajectories in ways that are complex to disentangle by observing the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
