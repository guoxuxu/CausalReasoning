  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a linear operator. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where L is another linear operator and S is a transformation matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can you determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is insufficient to backtrack uniquely to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without records of whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied. The transformation could have altered the initial condition in a manner that is not recoverable only from the final state under M, especially if L introduces new dynamics not aligned with M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
