  "Problem": "We are investigating the temperature dynamics in a material described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Consider the effect of a thermal control method described by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we deterministically ascertain which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) solely from knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite understanding the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), the convergence of multiple exponential effects generated by different interventions can result in similar thermal outcomes. These outcomes might erroneously appear to originate from singular or varying sequences of interventions, obfuscating clear backtracking to the exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
