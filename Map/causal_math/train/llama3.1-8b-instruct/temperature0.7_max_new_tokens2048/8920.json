  "Problem": "In the context of continuous-time Markov chains, consider the transition rate matrix Q for a two-state system where state 0 can transition to state 1 and vice versa. Let \\\\(\\\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\\\) be the state-transition matrix used to solve for the probabilities of state occurrences over time t.\n\nGiven the state probabilities at t = T, can one unequivocally determine whether a change in transition rates (from Q to Q') took place, and when?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the end probabilities at t = T does not reveal if or when the transition rate matrix was changed from Q to Q', because the same terminal distribution could result from different sequences and timings of changes in the rate matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transition rate Q → State probabilities at t = T; \n                   State probabilities at t = T → Change in transition rates (from Q to Q'); \n                   Change in transition rates (from Q to Q') → Time of change"
