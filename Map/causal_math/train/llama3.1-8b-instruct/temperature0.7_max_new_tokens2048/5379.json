  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(x, y) = \\\\int_{0}^{y} e^{At} x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent vector function. We assess how applying an operational matrix \\\\( H \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) when integrated to time \\\\( y \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention adjusting \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by a transformation \\\\( G \\\\), defined as \\\\( x(t) \\\\to Gx(t) \\\\) at a specific point \\\\( t_1< y \\\\), is introduced, will the final outcome of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) only rely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( H \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix \\\\( G \\\\) changes the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), resulting in the alteration of the integrand to \\\\( e^{At} Gx(t) \\\\) post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\). Consequently, the end value of the transformation at \\\\( y \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( H \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\), as well as \\\\( A \\\\), since they contribute to altering the path of integration.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
