  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a function \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a transformation through a Laplace Transform, represented by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = X(s) \\). Afterward, an inverse operation is applied via \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{X(s)\\} \\) over numeric domain s, using a different parameter set \\( p \\).\n\nIf \\( x(t) \\) is initially transformed to \\( X(s) \\) using standard parameters, and then reverted using \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{X(s)\\} \\) without any alteration in parameters, will \\( x(t) \\) at the end recover its original form?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\) is the exact mathematical inverse of \\( \\mathcal{L} \\), applying these transformations consecutively without changing parameters or intervening effects will perfectly recover the original function \\( x(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
