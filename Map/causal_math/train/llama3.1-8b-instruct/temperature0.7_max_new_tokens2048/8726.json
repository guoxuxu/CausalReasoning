  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) on a vector \\\\( v \\\\) in a vector space, where A is a constant matrix. Assessing the role of an additive perturbation \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) applied to this transformation, where \\\\( w \\\\) is another constant vector.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(v) \\\\), it is unclear whether the initial condition was \\\\( v_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Av_0 \\\\. The lack of information about the initial application of A makes it impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( v_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
