  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output signal \\( z(t) \\) is determined by applying a Laplace transform \\( L \\) to an input signal \\( x(t) \\). The transfer function in the Laplace domain is given by \\( H(s) = \\frac{s + a}{s + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\nIf the input signal \\( x(t) \\) is modulated by a function \\( m(t) \\) before applying the Laplace transform, resulting in \\( L(m(t) x(t)) = M(s)X(s) \\), will the overall transformed output \\( Z(s) \\) be affected solely by the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation \\( m(t) \\) changes the original signal \\( x(t) \\) before the Laplace transform is applied, resulting in a modified Laplace domain representation \\( M(s)X(s) \\). Thus, the outcome \\( Z(s) = H(s)M(s)X(s) \\) is influenced by \\( M(s) \\) alongside \\( H(s) \\), affecting the output differently than just \\( H(s)X(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
