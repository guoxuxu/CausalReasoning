  "Problem": "Analyze a feedback system involving the complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - cz} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to the initial input \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and is continuously re-applied to its own output in a feedback loop. Additionally, explore how the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) influences the system over time.\n\nGiven the state of the system as \\\\( z(\\\\infty) \\\\), can we conclusively identify whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or just the feedback process involving \\\\( f(z) \\\\) were applied if both could lead to the same stable state under certain conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact transformation(s) used to reach \\\\( z(\\\\infty) \\\\) is complex when similar stable states can be achieved through different paths due to the properties of the complex transformation functions. Without explicit details on the dynamics (time of intervention, nature of transformations) the causal path to \\\\( z(\\\\infty) \\\\) remains undeterminable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
