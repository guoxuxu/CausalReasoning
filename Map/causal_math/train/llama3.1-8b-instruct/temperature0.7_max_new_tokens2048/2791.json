  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and its transformation by an integral operator \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi e^{-it}z(t) dt \\\\). Analyze this transformation and its properties.\n\nIf a manipulating function \\\\( M[z] = z(t) - e^{it} \\\\) is applied at a specific instant, will the result of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) depend only on the initial function, considering no other changes?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( M \\\\) alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself to now read as a zero function for all time post-manipulation due to cancellation. When this manipulated function is subjected to the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), it remains zero independent of the original function properties. Essentially, the output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) depends critically on the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
