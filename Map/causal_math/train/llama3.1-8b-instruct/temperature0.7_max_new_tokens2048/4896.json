  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We assess the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), applied to a function \\\\( f(t) = t^k \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the endpoint result of combined transformations \\\\( T[f] \\\\) and \\\\( G[f] \\\\), can the exact interventions (original \\\\( k \\\\) value and the specific derivative order \\\\( m \\\\)) be determined just from the function form seen at \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( k \\\\) and derivative orders \\\\( m \\\\) could potentially yield the same final form of the function due to the compound nature of the transformations. The resulting function's format at a specific value of \\\\( z \\\\) and the overlap in properties of derivatives in the complex domain create ambiguities in reversing to precise conditions and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
