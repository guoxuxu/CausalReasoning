  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) according to the integral transformation \\\\( V(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)/RC} I(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where R and C are constants representing the resistance and capacitance, respectively.\n\nGiven the final output voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial input current \\\\( I(0) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The output voltage at any time T is influenced by the entire history of the input current up to that time due to the convolution nature of the integral. Information about \\\\( V(T) \\\\) alone is insufficient to uniquely backtrack to determine \\\\( I(0) \\\\) without further knowledge of the current's behavior over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
