  "Problem": "Assume we have a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The system is subject to different treatment functions, specifically \\\\( f(x) = Sx \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) = Tx \\\\), where S and T are constant matrices. Consider how the transformations affect the system's state vector over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\) with no further modifications, does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend solely on the matrix S?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(x) = Sx \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition to \\\\( Sx_0 \\\\). Although the transformation initially depends on S, the state vector’s evolution to \\\\( x(T) \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\) will be influenced by both the properties of S (initial modification) and L (determines the trajectory), not solely by S.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
