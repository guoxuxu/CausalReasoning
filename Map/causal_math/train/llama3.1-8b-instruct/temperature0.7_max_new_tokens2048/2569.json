  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. Let's analyze the effect of a transformation denoted by \\\\( h(z) = Pe^{Qt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where P is a constant matrix and Q is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial state to \\\\( Pz_0 \\\\) and applies an additional transformation dynamic \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\). The resulting trajectory of the system is affected both by the matrix exponentials \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), and the interaction between P, Q, and D may alter the result significantly from the untransformed system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
