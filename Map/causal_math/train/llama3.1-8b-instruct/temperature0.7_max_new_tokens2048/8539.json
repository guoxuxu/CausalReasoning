  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) with kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( S \\\\) with a different kernel is applied sometime after the initial condition, will the final state of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) solely depend on the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the properties of \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) will be influenced by both the initial transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and any further transformations such as \\\\( S \\\\). Each transformation has the potential to modify the spectral characteristics of \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), thus affecting how \\\\( L \\\\) acts on the transformed initial conditions over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
