  "Problem": "Examine the steady-state behavior of a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real valued function satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) for a constant matrix A, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. Consider the Fourier transform applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and its interactions.\n\nObserving the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), can we unambiguously determine the value of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at any specific time without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform provides information about the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), but the phase information and the exact moment in time for specific values of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) are not directly retrievable due to the inherent properties of the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
