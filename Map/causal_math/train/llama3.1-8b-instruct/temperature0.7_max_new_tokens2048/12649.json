  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), which maps complex function input in the time domain to the frequency domain. An intervention involves altering the system by a complex function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) such that the new system's output is \\\\( Y(s) = X(s) \\\\cdot H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformed output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the absence of knowledge of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)'s application, can the original input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) always be precisely identified?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether an intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) has been applied, the transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could have potentially altered \\\\( X(s) \\\\), thus obscuring the original signal characteristics. Recovering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) precisely without this knowledge is not generally possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
