  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider the modification of the initial temperature distribution by the function \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, does the evolved temperature distribution at time t reflect only the properties of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding a sinusoidal wave, which alters the subsequent evolution of the temperature field according to the heat equation. The term \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) introduces additional spatial variation, influencing the temperature distribution over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
