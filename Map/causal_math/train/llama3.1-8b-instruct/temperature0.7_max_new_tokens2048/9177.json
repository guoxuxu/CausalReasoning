  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from the evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) alone under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at the initial time modifies the starting value from \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( Bx \\\\). As \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}(Bx) \\\\), the trajectory will differ unless B commutes with \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), which is generally not the case unless \\\\( B \\\\) is a scalar multiple of the identity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
