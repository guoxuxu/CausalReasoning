  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) over an interval [0, T] from the value of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates and modifies the original function over the interval, producing a single value or function of time that lacks the information required to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the entire interval due to the irreversible nature of the integration process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
