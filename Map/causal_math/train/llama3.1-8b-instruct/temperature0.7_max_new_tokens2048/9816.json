  "Problem": "Analyze the integral transformation \\\\( F(p) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(x) = cos(x) \\\\), where p represents a complex number. We study how changing the parameter p affects the transformation and the resulting function.\n\nCan we definitively determine the sequence of p values used in the transformations (whether starting at real numbers and moving to complex, or vice versa) solely based on observing \\\\( F(p) \\\\) at a final value of p?",
  "Explanation": "The output function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) for a given p does not retain explicit traces of the sequence of parameter values due to the nature of the transformation. The same final integral value could potentially result from different paths or sequences of p, thereby obscuring the exact sequence of transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
