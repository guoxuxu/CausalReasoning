  "Problem": "We examine the stability and effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T_w [f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-wt} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) accurately after applying the transformation \\\\( T_w \\\\), without knowing additional details about \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( w \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( T_w [f](x) \\\\) is not feasible due to the loss of specific information caused by the integration and the exponential factor. The transformation is not necessarily invertible, especially without precise knowledge of \\\\( w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of w determines the transformation T_w, and the original function f is determined by A."
