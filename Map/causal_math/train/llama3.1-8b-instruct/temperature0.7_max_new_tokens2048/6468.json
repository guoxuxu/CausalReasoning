  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We investigate the causal effects of operations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and their expression through the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine whether a scaling was applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) just by observing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "Again, since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) involves integration over time, extracting the precise moment and nature of interventions on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from subsequent values of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is inherently ambiguous. Changes to the integral could be the result of various different operations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), not necessarily identifiable as scaling at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "scaling of z(t) → change in z(t); change in z(t) → change in g(z); change in s → change in g(z); t_1 → time; z(t) → g(z); t_1 → scaling of z(t)"
