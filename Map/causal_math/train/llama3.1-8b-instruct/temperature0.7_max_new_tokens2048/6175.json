  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Kz \\\\), where K is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\), which transforms the function to \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{z(0)}{s-K} \\\\), and its inverse on the function's evolution over time.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( K \\\\) to \\\\( M \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and then we allow the system to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be unaltered by the original \\\\( K \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the system’s governing constant from \\\\( K \\\\) to \\\\( M \\\\), affecting the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post-intervention. The state at any \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) is influenced by both the original evolution under \\\\( K \\\\) and the modified evolution under \\\\( M \\\\), linking the state trajectory across both periods.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
