  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time t, where B is also a real constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is another real constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an additional transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces further modifications based on the matrix \\\\( C \\\\). Both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), having influenced the state at different segments of its trajectory, contribute to the final state at \\\\( T \\\\), alongside the continuous driving influence of \\\\( iA \\\\). The result is a composite effect influenced by all the constants.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
