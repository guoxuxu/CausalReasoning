  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) with \\( \\lambda > 0 \\), and consider the transformation \\( T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t} \\) applied to \\( u \\).\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\) at some later time T, without knowing if \\( T(u) \\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of \\( T(u) \\), the transformation \\( e^{-\\lambda T} \\) can obscure the original state. The effect of \\( -\\lambda u \\) on \\( u \\) would exponentially decay the function, whereas implementing \\( T(u) \\) might initially preserve the state, creating ambiguity in reconstructing \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
