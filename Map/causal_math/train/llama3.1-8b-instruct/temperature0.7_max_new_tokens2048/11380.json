  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform on this function.\n\nGiven \\\\( W(s) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) was added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), or if \\\\( W(s) \\\\) resulted from only one function over all time?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transform \\\\( W(s) \\\\) could theoretically result from multiple combinations of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\), or from other functions entirely. Without additional constraints or data about time-specific interventions, it is not possible to uniquely determine the nature of input functions just from \\\\( W(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
