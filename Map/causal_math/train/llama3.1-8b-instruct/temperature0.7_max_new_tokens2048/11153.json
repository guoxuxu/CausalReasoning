  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex constant, and \\( z \\) represents the complex variable. This function undergoes a Laplace transform which alters its form to \\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\). We analyze the effect of this transformation over different hypothetical scenarios without and with interventions.\n\nIf the function \\( f(z) \\) is transformed by the Laplace transform without any modifications, will the inverse Laplace transform of \\( F(s) \\) return the original function \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, followed by its inverse, is designed to recover the original function under ideal conditions and assuming all requisites for existence and transformations are met. Therefore, the function \\( f(z) \\) can be perfectly retrieved from \\( F(s) \\) through the inverse Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
