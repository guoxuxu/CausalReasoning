  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( L: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\), defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). An external operation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Nt} \\\\) with \\\\( N \\\\) being another constant matrix, acts on the state space over time. The impact of this operation on the initial conditions and subsequent system behavior is studied.\n\nDoes the system, when subjected to \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and then evolved under transformation \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, arrive at the same state at t = T as if no initial operation \\\\( T(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(0) = e^{N \\\\times 0} \\\\) gives the identity, so initially, it might seem unchanged, but the presence of \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) can modify the growth behavior of the system state. Under transformation \\\\( L \\\\), the system evolves differently because the matrix \\\\( N \\\\) may introduce a differing scale or rotation, leading to a state that diverges from unmodified evolution under \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
