  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under a linear transformation described by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) applied on the vector representation \\\\( (x, y) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(u) du \\) is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation defined by a matrix \\\\( B \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and we observe \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), will this outcome depend solely on the transformations \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new transformation matrix \\\\( B \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) imparts a new behavior on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting its trajectory and therefore the resultant integral \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\. As a result, the outcome will depend on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), reflecting their combined influence on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
