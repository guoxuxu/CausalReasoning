  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) which converts function u(x, t) into its frequency components U(k, t).\n\nIf an intervention applying a different operator, say \\\\(M\\\\), is used at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) on the transformed function, will the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(L\\\\) and not on \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\(M\\\\) modifies the system's state in the frequency domain, which will affect subsequent evolution under \\\\(L\\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) depends on both the characteristics and actions of \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
