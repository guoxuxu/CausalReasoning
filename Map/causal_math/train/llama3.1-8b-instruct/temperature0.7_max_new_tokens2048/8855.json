  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the effects of applying the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) where C is a constant.\n\nIf an additional integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Dt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where D is a constant) is applied at a time \\\\( T_1 > T \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( z(T_2) \\\\) for \\\\( T_2 > T_1 \\\\) only depend on the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the second transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T_1 \\\\) applies another layer of modification to the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Both C and D govern the nature of the transformations applied, affecting the total modification of \\\\( z \\\\) and consequently the endpoint condition at \\\\( T_2 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
