  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and i is the imaginary unit. We study the influence of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the complex function value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint T, is it possible to trace back and unequivocally identify which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linearity and potential superposition effects in the complex plane involved in the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), as well as the integration operation, multiple transformation paths could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it indeterminable which specific transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
