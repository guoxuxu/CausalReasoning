  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the continuity equation \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) is the fluid density and \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is the velocity field. We examine the effect of a transformation represented by a complex function, \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\), on this flow over time period t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the density field \\\\( \\\\rho(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\), determining the original state of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}_0 \\\\) becomes ambiguous. The complex transformation could significantly alter the velocity trajectories and hence the observed density, precluding a clear reconstruction of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
