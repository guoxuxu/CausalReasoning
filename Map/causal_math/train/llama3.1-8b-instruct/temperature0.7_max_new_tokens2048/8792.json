  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's output. Suppose an external operator transforms the function using a unit step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( g(t) = f(t) u(t-a) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven only the Laplace transform of the endpoint \\\\( L[h(t)g(t)] \\\\) resulting from interventions with \\\\( u(t-a) \\\\) and \\\\( u(t-b) \\\\), can we determine precisely which step functions were used, based solely on the transform value?",
  "Explanation": "The shifts in the transform introduced by multiple step interventions can combine in ways that make it challenging to isolate the effects of each intervention separately. Without more information, multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) could lead to the same transformation, preventing precise identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
