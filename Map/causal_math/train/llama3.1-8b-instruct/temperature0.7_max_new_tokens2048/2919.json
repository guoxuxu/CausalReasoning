  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of an oscillating term. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is also a constant.\n\nIf an intervention using another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where T > t_1 be influenced only by the dynamics defined by A and not by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds an additional layer of complexity, modifying the trajectory and thereby making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a result of the interplay between A, C, and D. The transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) modify how the system evolves, affecting the final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
