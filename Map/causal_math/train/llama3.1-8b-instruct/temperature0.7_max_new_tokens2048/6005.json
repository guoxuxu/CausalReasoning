  "Problem": "Study a system governed by \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants, and consider the integration through a transform \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) applied to the variable \\( z = x + iy \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf the transformation \\( T(z) \\) is applied to a point \\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\) fulfilling \\( ax_0^2 + by_0^2 = c \\) and no further changes are made to the variables, will the result \\( T(z_0) \\) also satisfy the equation \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( z^3 \\) typically changes both the real and imaginary components of \\( z \\) in such a way that is not linearly or proportionately related to the initial \\( ax^2 + by^2 \\) unless specific relationships between \\( a, b, x, y \\) hold, making general satisfaction of the equation unlikely without those special conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
