  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Suppose the inverse transform \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time and it's subjected to various operations like multiplication by an exponential function or convolution.\n\nIf a complex function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transformation to give \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and then is modified by multiplying by \\\\( e^{st_0} \\\\) where \\\\( s_0 \\\\) is a shift in the s-domain, does the resulting inverse transform of this product yield \\\\( f(t-t_0) \\\\) essentially shifting the function in the time domain without any other alterations?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by multiplying by \\\\( e^{st_0} \\\\) in the s-domain corresponds to a time shift of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( t_0 \\\\) in the time domain because of the shifting property of the Laplace transform. This operation translates the function forward or backward in time without altering its shape or other properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
