  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the initial value problem defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{du}{dx} + q(x)u = 0 \\\\) with initial conditions. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to simplify this differential equation to a form involving complex functions.\n\nCan we determine the functions \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) from the transformed equation alone, under the assumption of no initial knowledge about the form or properties of \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed equation blends the effects of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) into a complex function form, obscuring direct information about the individual functions. Identification of these functions separately would generally require additional information beyond the transformed expression alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
