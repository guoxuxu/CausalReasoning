  "Problem": "Investigate a complex dynamical system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by the input \\( x(t) \\) according to a Laplace transform relationship \\( Z(s) = X(s)/s \\). Here, \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Z(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( z(t) \\) respectively, with \\( s \\) being a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( x(t) \\) to \\( x(t) + \\sin(t) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the resultant \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the initial transform relationship?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters \\( x(t) \\), introducing a new component to the transform \\( X(s) \\), which now includes terms from the Laplace transform of \\( \\sin(t) \\) (i.e., \\( \\frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \\)). The output \\( z(T) \\) will thus consist of effects from both the original exponential input and the sinusoidal intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
