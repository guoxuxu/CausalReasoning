  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is defined as the Laplace transform. We examine the effects this transformation has on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filtering transformation that alters frequencies is applied before converting back to the time domain, will the resulting function remain the same as \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional filtering transformation modifies the characteristics of the frequency domain representation, specifically altering the magnitudes and/or phases of specific frequencies. This change will affect the time domain representation upon applying the inverse Laplace transform, resulting in a function different from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "C → ω; ω → z(t); L → Laplace(z(t)); L → Z(s); s → Z(s); s → ω; s → C; filtering transformation → altered ω; altered ω → z'(t)"
