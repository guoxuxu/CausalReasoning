  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) in a complex domain, defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\). The causal inference involves analyzing transformations through the function and the reverse mapping from the function back to its inputs.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the values of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) given the transformed output \\\\( z' = z + 1 \\\\) without knowing the specific operation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation adds a complex number, it affects the possibility of uniquely tracing back to the original variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) might yield the same transformed output due to the square terms and introduction of the imaginary unit.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
