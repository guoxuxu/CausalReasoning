  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a linear operator described by the matrix equation \\\\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the behavior of the vector field under the mapping \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a transformation matrix, by applying it at different times t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to run according to \\\\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the initial condition was \\\\( x_0 \\\\) evolved directly under \\\\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). As a result, the state evolves from this new initial condition under \\\\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\\\), leading to a different state at t = T compared to the direct evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), unless M commutes with the exponential of D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
