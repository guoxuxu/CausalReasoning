  "Problem": "Study a system governed by \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants, and consider the integration through a transform \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) applied to the variable \\( z = x + iy \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nSuppose an intervention applies a new transformation \\( S(z) = z^2 \\) at some point \\( z_1 \\) resulting from \\( T(z) \\) from a starting \\( z \\) that satisfies \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\). Will \\( S(z_1) = z_1^2 \\) necessarily satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The double application of transformations \\( z^3 \\) followed by \\( z^2 \\) greatly modifies the original properties and relations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\( z \\), disrupting satisfaction with \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\) unless very specific conditions are met, which are generally not expected.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
