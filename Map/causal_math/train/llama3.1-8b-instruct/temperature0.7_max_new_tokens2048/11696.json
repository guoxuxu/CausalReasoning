  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) in a potentially modified basis, can we conclusively establish what transformations (whether \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) could result from different sequences or types of basis changes and interventions. Since basis transformations and matrix multiplications may not be uniquely reversible or deducible just from the endpoint, it's impossible to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
