  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^4 + i \\\\cdot t^3 \\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation on this function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to the Laplace transformation without any additional operations, will the transformed function describe the original behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane over time t?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, by its definition and properties, translates the time domain function into the complex frequency domain capturing all the dynamics of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through its transformation. This includes all aspects of how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
