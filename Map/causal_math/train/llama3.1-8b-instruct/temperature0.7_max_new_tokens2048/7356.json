  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-dependent system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. An integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nGiven just the final state \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) and knowledge of the initial PDE, can we definitively say whether the transformation \\\\( G(u) \\\\) was applied at any time t_1 < T?",
  "Explanation": "While we can reconstruct a possible \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) from \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform, without additional information about the specific form or existence of intermediate transformations like \\\\( G \\\\), multiple arrangements (with or without G) could lead to the same end result, making it impossible to confirm the application of \\\\( G \\\\) solely from \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
