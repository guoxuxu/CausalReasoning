  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real number representing time. We are analyzing how the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t}dt \\\\) affects our understanding of the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represents the input to a system with a response characterized by its Fourier transform, does the integral transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) for a fixed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) capture all variations of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) results in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - 1) \\\\), which captures the dominant frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\) but does not encode temporal variations beyond the identified frequency. This means transient behaviors or changes in amplitude are not captured.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
