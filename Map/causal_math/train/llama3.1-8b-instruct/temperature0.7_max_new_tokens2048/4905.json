  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} F(t) dt \\\\, C \\\\) where C is the contour in the complex plane and F(t) is an analytic function. We are investigating the implications of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\( L[G] \\\\) on \\\\( G(z) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( L[G] \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( G(z) \\\\) with a specific contour \\\\( C \\\\), and the resulting function is analyzed without further modifications, does the transformation change the poles or singularities of the function \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( L[G] \\\\) on \\\\( G(z) \\\\) can alter the nature of the integral by affecting the singularities or by altering the decay characteristics, which in turn changes the poles and singularities of the original function depending on the nature of L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
