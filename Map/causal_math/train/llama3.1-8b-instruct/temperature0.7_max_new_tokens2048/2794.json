  "Problem": "Consider the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\\\) over a closed contour C in the complex plane, where a and w are constants, and w lies inside C. This transformation explores the impact of parameter 'a' on function behavior around singular point w.\n\nCan the value of parameter 'a' be deduced by analyzing the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) if the value of w and the contour C are unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the pole position w and the specific path contour C, different configurations of these can lead to similar effects, making it difficult to backtrack uniquely to the parameter 'a' based solely on the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → singular point; w → singular point; parameter 'a' → function behavior; function behavior → value of parameter 'a'; function behavior → contour C; contour C → singular point; contour C → function behavior"
