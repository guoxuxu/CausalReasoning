  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real scalar and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex number value. We apply continuous linear transformations \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex number, to this function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we infer the sequence and nature of transformations (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) applied to the initial state?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact transformations or their sequence used to reach \\\\(z(T)\\\\) from only the final state is not feasible without additional context. The multiplicative effects of transformations and their order (around different parts of the evolution process) may produce indistinguishable final states from differing transformation scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
