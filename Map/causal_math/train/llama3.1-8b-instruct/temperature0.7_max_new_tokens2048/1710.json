  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of integral transformations on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-tx} f(x) dx \\\\), followed by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\). We examine the effects and causal sequences related to combining and modifying these transformations.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without knowing any modifications made during the process?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations involve exponential integrals, which can obscure or eliminate certain aspects of the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Recovery of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( h(x) \\\\) might not be unique due to the loss of information inherent in the integral transformation process (e.g., higher frequencies might be dampened or lost).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
