  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf the magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a given \\\\( t \\\\) is known to be small, can we infer that \\\\( \\omega \\\\) was necessarily high?",
  "Explanation": "While a high \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can cause the magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to be small due to rapid oscillations leading to cancellations, a small magnitude could also result from specific time points where the integral naturally approaches zero due to its periodicity, independent of \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
