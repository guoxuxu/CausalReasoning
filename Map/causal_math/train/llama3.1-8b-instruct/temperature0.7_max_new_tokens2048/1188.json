  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation involving the Fourier integral representation by applying the transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}} e^{as} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nBy observing the final transform \\\\( F(s)G(s) \\\\) at some point, can we determine precisely if the intervention \\\\( G(s) = e^{bs} \\\\), the original transform modification parameter 'a', or both were applied, based only on the knowledge of the resulting transform?",
  "Explanation": "Given the resulting transform, multiple combinations of 'a', 'b', and even alterations in the initial function form \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can yield similar expressions in the transform space. The resulting form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}} e^{(a+b)s}  \\\\) could originate from different values of 'a' and 'b', making it challenging to pinpoint specific interventions or initial conditions uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
