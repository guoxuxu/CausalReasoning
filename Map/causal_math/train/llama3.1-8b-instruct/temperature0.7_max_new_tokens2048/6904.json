  "Problem": "Let's consider a function \\( z = h(x, y) \\) given by \\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\) in a two-dimensional space. We examine the role of a Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), applied to \\( h(x, y) \\) defined by \\( H(u, v) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(u, v) \\) and analyze its effect in the frequency domain.\n\nKnowing a function \\( q(x, y) \\) derived from \\( h(x, y) \\) through subsequent transformations and manipulations, can we determine the precise nature of interventions (like specific Fourier transform settings or filter applications) only by examining \\( q(x, y) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( q(x, y) \\) could potentially result from various combinations of transformations and filtering processes. The possible overlap in effects due to different intervention settings and lack of transparent information about initial conditions and operations makes it impossible to uniquely identify which interventions were applied to achieve \\( q(x, y) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
