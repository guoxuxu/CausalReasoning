  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\), which operates in the complex plane. The impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\\\) is investigated, where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\\\) is computed without modifying the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\), will the transformation properties change based solely on the initial function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation properties of the Laplace Transform will reflect the inherent characteristics of \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) and are determined by this specific function form and behavior in the complex domain, without modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
