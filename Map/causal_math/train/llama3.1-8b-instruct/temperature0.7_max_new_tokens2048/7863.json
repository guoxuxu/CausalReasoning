  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario with the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{st} \\\\). An external intervention uses the Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to modify the function before its evolution.\n\nIf a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is first Fourier transformed, followed by an application of a causal inversion operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{I} \\\\) (undoing the Fourier effect) mid-evolution, and then Laplace transformed, will the result depend solely on the initial function and the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the causal inversion operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{I} \\\\) specifically undoes the effects of the prior Fourier transform, effectively resetting the function to its original state, making the final outcome dependent only on the initial function and the subsequent Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
