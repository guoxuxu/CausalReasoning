  "Problem": "Examine a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. The transformation considered is through the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition.\n\nAfter observing the function \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we confirm whether the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) was applied to the initial function despite not intervening in the PDE's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The solution of the PDE in either transformed or original space leads to similar functional forms upon transformation back to the original space. Without additional information about the intermediate states, determining the use of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) from the final observation at \\\\(T\\\\) is indiscernible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Initial condition → u(x, T); λ → u(x, T); u(x, T) → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → λ; λ → PDE evolution; PDE evolution → u(x, T); Fourier transform → u(x, T)"
