  "Problem": "Consider a calculation involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The calculation examines the integral transformation across time t defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\int_0^T z(t) \\, dt \\\\) and impacts of interventions at different stages.\n\nKnowing that the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was zero, can we determine the exact frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) under our original conditions without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "If the integral \\\\( F(z) \\\\) results in zero, this implies full cycles of the sinusoidal function within the interval [0, T], but this does not uniquely identify \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Multiple frequencies (multiples of \\\\( \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\\\)) can satisfy this condition by completing different numbers of full cycles within the same interval.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
