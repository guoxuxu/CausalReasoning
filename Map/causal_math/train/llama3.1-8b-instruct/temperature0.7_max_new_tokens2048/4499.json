  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x,t) \\\\) governed by the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian operator. Let's analyze the effect of an external operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iBt} \\\\), where B is a constant operator, applied as a transformation on the wave function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( V(t) = e^{-iCt} \\\\) (where C is another constant operator) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on H and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( V(t) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor in the system. The final state \\\\( \\\\psi(x,T) \\\\) of the wave function would thereby depend on B, C, and H. The interaction of these operators, especially if they do not commute, means that the endpoint is influenced by all involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
