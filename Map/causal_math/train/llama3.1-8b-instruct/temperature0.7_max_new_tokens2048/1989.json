  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) is applied to the function at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve naturally under \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant function at t = T still obey the initial transformation rule set by \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) modifies the initial function at t = 0, influencing the trajectory of function evolution. As \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) evolves, the angle of rotation due to \\\\( \\omega \\\\) might interact differently when scaled or rotated initially by \\\\( M \\\\), resulting in a function that does not strictly adhere to just \\\\( M \\\\) applied to the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) path over time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
