  "Problem": "Consider a hypothetical physical system where the state of the system \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a constant matrix. We analyze the influence of changing the basis of the state vector using the transformation \\\\( T(x) = Px \\\\), where P is a matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another change of basis \\\\( S(x) = Qx \\\\) (where Q is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on P or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both the initial basis change and the intervention, as both P and Q can affect how the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\). Since the system’s trajectory depends on the combined effects of P, Q, and D, the endpoint is contingent on all three matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
