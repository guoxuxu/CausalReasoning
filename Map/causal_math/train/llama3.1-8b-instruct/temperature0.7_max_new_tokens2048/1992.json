  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at different times.\n\nGiven the function form at t = T, can we precisely determine the nature of both transformations (whether both \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or just one was applied) based only on this ending function form?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities introduced by successive transformations and the fact that multiple combinations of matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) could lead to similar end results at t = T, it is impossible to definitively determine the nature and number of transformations applied simply by observing the ending function form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
