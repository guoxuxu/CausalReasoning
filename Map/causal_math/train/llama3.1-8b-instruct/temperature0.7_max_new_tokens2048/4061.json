  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\}(s) = F(s)\\\\). We evaluate how a convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) impacts the transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then transformed, is the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the Laplace domain. Thus, convolving \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) results in the Laplace transform being shifted by \\\\( a \\\\), which indeed results in \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\). There are no additional time-dependent changes because the transform shift is calculated instantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "convolution of f(t) and g(t) → Laplace transform of convolution; time t = 0 → initial condition; a → shift in s in Laplace transform; T → evaluation time"
