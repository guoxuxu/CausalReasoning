  "Problem": "Consider that velocity \\\\( v \\\\) of a particle moving in a one-dimensional space is governed by the equation \\\\( v = \\\\omega x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of an integral transform \\\\( I(x) = \\\\int x e^{-\\\\lambda t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is also a constant, applied to the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of the particle.\n\nIf \\\\( I(x) \\\\) is applied to the position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( v = \\\\omega x \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting velocity \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( v = \\\\omega x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( I(x) \\\\) significantly alters the initial conditions by integrating the position over time with a decaying exponential factor, which affects the system's overall trajectory, resulting in a different velocity profile over time than when no transformation is applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
