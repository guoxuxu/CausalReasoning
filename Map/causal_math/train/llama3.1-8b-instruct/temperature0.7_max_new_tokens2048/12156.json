  "Problem": "Imagine a system where the temperature distribution on a plate is modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), and as an experiment, a function \\\\( h(u) = e^{-kt}u \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant) is applied at different times to alter the temperature pattern.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will the distribution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( h(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling the temperature distribution. As the Laplace equation governs steady-state conditions, the initial manipulation of the temperature directly determines the system's evolution to a new steady-state, making the distribution at time T different unless \\\\( k=0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
