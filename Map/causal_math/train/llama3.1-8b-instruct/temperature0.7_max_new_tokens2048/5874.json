  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system characterized by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}s \\\\, ds \\\\), where M is another constant matrix, applied to the system's state over time interval t.\n\nAfter observing the system's state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the precise initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\), being an integral modification of the initial state, changes the system's trajectory from the outset. Without knowing whether this transformation was applied, one cannot accurately trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) due to the non-invertibility of the modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
