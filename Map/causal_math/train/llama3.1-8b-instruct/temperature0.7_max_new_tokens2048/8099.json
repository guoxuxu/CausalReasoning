  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( i\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is also a constant complex matrix, on the system over time t.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where E is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) further alters the trajectory and thus the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interaction of matrices C, D, and E. The series of exponential transformations affects the system's state evolution and hence the final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
