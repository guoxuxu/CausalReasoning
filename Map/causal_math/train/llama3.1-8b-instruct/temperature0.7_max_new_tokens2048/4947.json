  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the integration transformation applied to this function over a period \\\\(T\\\\), defined by the integral \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iAt} dt \\\\).\n\nIf a continuous transformation \\\\( G(t) = e^{iBt}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied from 0 to \\\\(T\\\\), does the integration of this transformation, \\\\( \\\\int_0^T G(t) dt \\\\), uniquely depend on \\\\(A\\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( G(t) \\\\) incorporates additional dynamics into the original function via matrix \\\\(B\\\\), making the resulting integral dependent on both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). The transformation modifies the aggregate behavior, reflected in the integration result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
