  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex constant, on the evolution and behavior of this system.\n\nCan we conclusively identify the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from just observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), influenced by a potentially unknown transformation, does not provide a unique or reliable pathway to trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the added effects and integration of \\\\( e^{Bs}z(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
