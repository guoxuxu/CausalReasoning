  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( A \\) is a real matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\( T(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\), applied to \\( z(t) \\) at different time points \\( t \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\( T(z(t)) \\), can we accurately determine whether the intervention \\( g(t) \\) was applied during the transformation, solely from the information about \\( T(z(t)) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed data \\( T(z(t)) \\) could be the result of different initial setups or interventions, especially when considering the infinite possibilities in selecting \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Such transformations obscure the individual impact of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), and multiple scenarios might yield similar or undistinctive outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
