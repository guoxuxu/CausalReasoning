  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the potential function \\\\( V(x) = -\\\\alpha x^2 + \\\\beta x^4 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. Investigate the effects of perturbing the initial position of the particle using a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + \\\\delta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is a small constant, on the system's long-term behavior.\n\nIf midway through the evolution, at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a sudden intervention shifts the particle position by \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) (another small constant), will the particle's final position at \\\\( t = T \\\\) solely depend on the original dynamics and not on the interventions \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional shift \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) introduces another level of alteration to the system's state. Given the nonlinear and sensitive dynamics of the system, both perturbations \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) can significantly influence the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\), changing the trajectory in a way that depends on both the initial and intervening modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
