  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, and an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to it. Analyze how identifying causal relations in such a context might be impacted by the properties of the function and transformation.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) is modified by subtly changing the variable \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( x' \\\\), will the transformed function using \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( h(x', y) \\\\) be the same as for the original \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) without knowing the specifics of \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the variable \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( x' \\\\) may result in a change in the function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\), which, due to the potentially nonlinear properties of \\\\( h \\\\), might affect the output of the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\). Without specific details of how \\\\( h \\\\) behaves with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\), the transformation result can differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
