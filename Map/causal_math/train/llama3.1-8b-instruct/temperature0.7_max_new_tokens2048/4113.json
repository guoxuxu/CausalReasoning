  "Problem": "We examine a signal transformation using the Laplace transform in an electrical circuit. The input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is studied in the Laplace domain by applying \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), respectively.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is altered to \\\\( x'(t) = x(t) + \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\), and then transformed without further interference, will \\\\( Y'(s) = Y(s) + \\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) describe the output accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, due to the linearity and time-invariance of the system. The addition of \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) directly translates in the Laplace domain to adding \\\\( \\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) to \\\\( X(s) \\\\), thus the altered output \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) will accurately reflect this input change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
