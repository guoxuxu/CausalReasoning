  "Problem": "Investigate a vector field governed by a linear transformation and its potential modification by another function defined as \\( h(x) = \\int e^{Mt} dt \\cdot x \\), where M is a constant matrix. The original vector function is defined by \\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\), for a constant matrix L.\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve without further intervention under \\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\), will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) had been evolved directly under \\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\) for the same period?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation \\( h(x) \\) modifies the initial state by introducing a transformation dependent on M. This influence, dependent on the relationship between M and L, will change the trajectory from what would occur if \\( x_0 \\) were evolved directly under \\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\), indicating a new state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
