  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nIf the mapping function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves according to its natural law \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), will the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to T without the mapping?",
  "Explanation": "The mapping function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) modifies the initial phase of the oscillator, which affects its trajectory. Since phase is critical in determining the exact position of a harmonic oscillator, the resulting position will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
