  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) and we explore the functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\). We evaluate the behavior and causal inference scenarios of this function under various transformations and time periods.\n\nGiven the endpoint result of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after various transformations including \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence and types of transformations applied by observing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially arise from multiple transformation sequences given the non-linear nature of the functions \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\), which complicate the relationship between the initial and final states. Different sequences of applying \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\), or their inverses, could yield the same final result, leading to ambiguity in identifying the exact transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
