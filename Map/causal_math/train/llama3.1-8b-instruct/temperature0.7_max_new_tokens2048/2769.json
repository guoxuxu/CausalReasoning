  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\\\\), which defines the Laplace Transform of a time-domain function \\\\(f(t)\\\\). We explore how the application of a multiplier function \\\\(g(t) = e^{at}\\\\) affects this transformation, where \\\\(a\\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf we apply the function \\\\(g(t)\\\\) to \\\\(f(t)\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(h(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\\\), and compute the Laplace Transform, will the resulting transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s)\\\\) be equal to the original transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s)\\\\) just shifted by \\\\(-a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplier \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) in the time domain corresponds to a shift in the Laplace Transform domain. According to the shifting property of the Laplace Transform, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at} f(t))(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s-a)\\\\), effectively shifting the transform of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) by \\\\(-a\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
