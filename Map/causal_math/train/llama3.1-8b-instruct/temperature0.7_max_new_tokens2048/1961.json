  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a linear time-invariant differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) operating on a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and consider the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[u(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\). Assume \\\\( L[u(t)] = -u''(t) + 3u'(t) - 2u(t) \\\\), and study the Laplace transform effects.\n\nIf \\\\( T[u(t)] \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the result is then processed with the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\), without any additional transformation, will the sequence \\\\( L[T[u(t)]] \\\\) equal to \\\\( T[L[u(t)]] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operator, which commutes with linear differential operators whose coefficients do not depend on the variable of transformation (time in this case). Thus, applying \\\\( L \\\\) after \\\\( T \\\\) yields the same result as first applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and then transforming the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
