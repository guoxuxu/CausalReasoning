  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a spatially varying coefficient. The impact of the initial transformation by Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[u(x,0)](s) \\\\) is studied over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[u(x,0)](s) \\\\) is calculated for the initial condition u(x,0) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the function u(x,t) at any later time t be equivalent to the solution obtained by solving the differential equation directly from u(x,0)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of the initial condition does not alter the function itself but provides a different representation. When the inverse Laplace transform is applied to get back to the time domain, it will yield the same result as evolving u(x,0) under the given PDE, provided that no other boundary conditions or transformations intervene.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
