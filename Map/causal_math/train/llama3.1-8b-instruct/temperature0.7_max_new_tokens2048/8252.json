  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The scenario investigates how the function's behavior changes under various transformations, particularly a transformation applied by an integral operator \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(Tf(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\alpha s} f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a fixed real constant.\n\nGiven the final state of the system after multiple transformations including \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied at what times during the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of multiple intertwined transformations makes it significantly complicated to backtrack and ascertain precisely the nature and sequence of operations applied. The impact of integral and linear transformations merge the influences in a manner that conceals the individual effects of the operations involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
