  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a linear operator in a complex function space. We investigate how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention involving the inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively depend on M?",
  "Explanation": "The application of both \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and its inverse \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\), changing its state path significantly. While M dictates the system's general behavior, the transformations applied modify how and which attributes (time or frequency) are affected until time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
