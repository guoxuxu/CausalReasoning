  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) describes a rotation with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We explore the response of the system when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to a transformation using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven only the ending state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowledge that interventions might have occurred, can we determine exactly whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), or both were applied, along with their parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The final point \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be the result of various combinations of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\) with differing parameters. The overlapping effects of complex transformations hinder the definitive identification of which, if any, transformations were applied, as well as the precise values of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( d \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
