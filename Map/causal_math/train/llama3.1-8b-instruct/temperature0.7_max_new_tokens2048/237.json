  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit containing an inductor and a resistor in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( I \\\\) is the current, \\\\( L \\\\) is the inductance, \\\\( R \\\\) is the resistance, and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent voltage source. We examine the impact of an initial transformation of the current by \\\\( f(I) = I_0e^{kt} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(I) \\\\) is applied to an initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at any time t be the same as if \\\\( I_0 \\\\) was directly used as the initial condition in the absence of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation alters the initial value of the current, and since the equation governing the system is a first-order linear differential equation, the solution's trajectory will be affected by these new initial conditions. This changes the entire subsequent behavior of the circuit's current over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
