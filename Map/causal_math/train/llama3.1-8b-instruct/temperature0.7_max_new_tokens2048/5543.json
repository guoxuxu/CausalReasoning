  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) as matrices. We explore the role of a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that modifies the input \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by the function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\).\n\nIf we intervene by applying another transformation \\\\( g(z) = Nz \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another matrix) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) exclusively depend on the original operator \\\\( L \\\\) irrespective of \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) contributes additional dynamics into the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the original transformation by \\\\( M \\\\), the action of \\\\( L \\\\) until time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the subsequent modification by \\\\( N \\\\). These series of transformations imply that the final output is a result of complex interactions among \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
