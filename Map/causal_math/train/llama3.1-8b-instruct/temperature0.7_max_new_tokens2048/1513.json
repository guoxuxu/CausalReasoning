  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency of the system. We explore the effects of a linear transformation \\\\(T(x) = Ax + B\\\\), where A and B are matrices, on the system's state.\n\nIf \\\\(T(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the oscillator's dynamics without further intervention, will the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t be equivalent to evolution directly from \\\\(x_0\\\\) under the harmonic oscillator's dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) modifies the initial condition, altering the state's trajectory. Since the transformation includes a translation by B and a linear transformation by A, the resulting motion trajectory of the oscillator will differ from that which would have been obtained by simply evolving \\\\(x_0\\\\) under the oscillator’s dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Linear transformation T(x) → State x_0; State x_0 → Evolution of x(t); Evolution of x(t) → x(t); Linear transformation T(x) → Evolution of x(t)"
