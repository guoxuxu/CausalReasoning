  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation where a signal x(t) is first converted to X(s) using the Laplace transformation. The transformed signal X(s) is then modified by a multiplicative function H(s), which acts as a system's transfer function. Finally, the modified signal Y(s) = H(s)X(s) is converted back to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transformation to yield y(t).\n\nIf an additional filtering operation represented by a function G(s) is applied to Y(s) before inverse transformation, resulting in Z(s) = G(s)Y(s), will the final z(t) still depend strictly on x(t)?",
  "Explanation": "While G(s) modifies Y(s) to produce Z(s), the final output z(t) still causally depends on the original x(t) because every transformation step linearly depends on the preceding step. The path of dependency on x(t) persists, albeit modified by the effects of G(s).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
