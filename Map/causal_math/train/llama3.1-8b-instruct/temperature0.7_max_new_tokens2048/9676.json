  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of z. The initial state \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) undergoes a transformation via the operation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents a frequency of rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a final time T, is it possible to determine precisely which transformation(s) were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of complex rotations and possible overlapping effects where the same endpoint could result from different combinations of frequency and rotation direction, it's impossible to definitively identify the interventions from the endpoint alone. The multiple pathways by which the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be reached introduce too many uncertainties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
