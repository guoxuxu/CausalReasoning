  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is studied, where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) (where P is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another transformation component in the form of \\\\( e^{Pt} \\\\). The outcome at time T will then depend on the interactions among M, N, and P. These matrix effects could differentially modify the trajectory, making the final state a function of all matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
