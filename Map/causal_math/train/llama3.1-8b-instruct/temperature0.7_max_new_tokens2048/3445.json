  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) encompasses dynamics given by the matrix A. We explore the influence of modifying the function through multiplication by a matrix exponential \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) resulting in a new function \\\\( h(t) = e^{Bt}e^{At} \\\\) without any further modifications, will the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at s = 0 be similar to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at s = 0 without applying \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) changes the eigenvalues of the function's matrix from A to \\\\( A+B \\\\), affecting the Laplace transform. The final result at s = 0 (e.g., integrating e^{(A+B)t} from 0 to infinity) is generally different unless A commutes with B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
