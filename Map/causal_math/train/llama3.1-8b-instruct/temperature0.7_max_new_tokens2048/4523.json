  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the function u, and then evolving it under a transformed operator \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( G(u) = F^{-1}(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\) (inverse Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the previous application of F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) after \\\\( F(u) \\\\) transforms the function back from frequency-space to time-space, but the intermediate evolution and effects due to \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and \\\\( G(u) \\\\) influence the final state of u(T). The transformations can interact in complex ways, depending on the specific forms of L, making the endpoint dependent on the nature and sequence of the transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
