  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in an electric field described by a vector function \\\\(E(x, t)\\\\). The velocity of the particle \\\\(v(t)\\\\) at time t is affected by this field through the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = qE(x(t), t)\\\\), where q is the charge of the particle and x(t) its position. We investigate the impact of the function \\\\(g(x, v, t) = e^{At}v + \\int_0^t K(t, s) x(s) ds\\\\), with A being a constant matrix and K(t, s) an integral kernel function.\n\nIf a different function \\\\(h(x, v, t) = Cx(t) + Dt\\\\) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), where C is a constant matrix and D a vector, will the velocity \\\\(v(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced exclusively by the original equation \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = qE(x(t), t)\\\\) and not by the initial transformation \\\\(g\\\\) or intervention \\\\(h\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\(h(x, v, t)\\\\) introduces additional modifications, affecting both the trajectory and velocity differently based on matrix and vector contributions from C and D, along with earlier transformations from A and K.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
