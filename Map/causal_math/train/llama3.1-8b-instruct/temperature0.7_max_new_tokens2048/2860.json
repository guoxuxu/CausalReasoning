  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) in a complex domain, defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\). The causal inference involves analyzing transformations through the function and the reverse mapping from the function back to its inputs.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\), can we unequivocally establish the scaling intervention \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) applied to \\\\( y \\\\) just by observing the function’s output?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + i(\\lambda y)^2 \\\\) is dependent on both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\lambda y \\\\). Multiple values of \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) could result in the same output due to the squared terms and dependencies, making it impossible to identify the exact intervention solely from the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
