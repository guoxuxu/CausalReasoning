  "Problem": "Let's examine a continuity equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (vu) = 0\\\\), where v is a fixed velocity field. Consider the Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)(k)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx}u(x) dx\\\\) applied to the function u. We explore how this transformation affects the evolution of u over time.\n\nGiven u(T) under a known velocity field with interventions, is it feasible to exactly specify whether the Fourier transformation, the scalar intervention, or both were applied during the timeline?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the Fourier transformation and the scalar intervention in the continuity equation potentially overlap and cannot be distinctly distinguished at T solely based on the outcome u(T). Both operations affect the system state similarly by modifying amplitude and shifts within the Fourier domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
