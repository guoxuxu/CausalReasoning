  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The function undergoes a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we accurately trace back and determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) would require precise knowledge of any transformations applied. The presence of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) in the initial condition significantly alters the backward computation, and without confirming the use or nature of such a modification, the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be precisely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
