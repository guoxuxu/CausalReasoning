  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We're curious about the nature of the function under the Laplace transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). Consider s as a complex parameter and investigate specific properties under direct transformations and interventions.\n\nConsidering the output of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\) from the intervened function, can the specific intervention (i.e., the value of constant \\\\( a \\\\)) be determined directly from the transform result?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform from the intervened function may often resemble that from other possible interventions, particularly due to the complex exponential nature and its sensitivity to input changes. This does not allow for a unique back-calculation to the original intervention unless additional specific conditions or information about the system are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
