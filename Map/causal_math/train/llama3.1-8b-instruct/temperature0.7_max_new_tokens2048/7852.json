  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) in the complex plane where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), described by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dz} = Pu(z) \\\\), with P being a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qz}u(z) \\\\), where Q is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(Z) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) based only on knowing \\\\( u(Z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(Z) \\\\) can result from different sequences or types of transformations, and given the potential non-commutative nature of complex matrix exponentials, it's unfeasible to uniquelly identify the specific interventions involved. The final state may be reachable through various transformation paths, adding ambiguity to any backward inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
