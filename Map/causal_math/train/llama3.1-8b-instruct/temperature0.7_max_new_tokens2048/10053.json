  "Problem": "Examine a system where electric potential V is described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) within a region and manipulate the boundary conditions to observe causal effects. We're especially interested in how transformations such as conformal mappings can infer changes in electric field distributions.\n\nIf a conformal mapping \\\\(f(z) = z^2\\\\) is applied to transform the spatial domain, does this change the solution \\\\(V\\\\) within the new domain although starting with the same boundary conditions in the original domain?",
  "Explanation": "Conformal mappings preserve the angle but not the length, distorting distances and therefore affecting the gradient of potential, \\\\(\\\\nabla V\\\\). Since boundary conditions are the same but the domain shape changes, the solution inside the domain, i.e., the distribution of electric potential, will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
