  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real number and represents angular frequency. The function is initially subjected to the linear operator \\\\( L \\{ z(t) \\} = \\\\int_{0}^{∞} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), which represents the Laplace transform.\n\nIs it possible to determine the exact value of \\\\( ω \\\\) after observing the outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific form of the Laplace transform outcome, \\\\( L \\{ e^{iωt} \\} = 1 /(s - iω) \\), the parameter \\\\( ω \\\\) can be directly obtained from the expression’s denominator, assuming \\\\( s \\\\) is known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
