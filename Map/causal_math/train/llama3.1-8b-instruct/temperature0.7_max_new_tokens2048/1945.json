  "Problem": "Assume a linear algebra context where we define the operation \\\\( L(v) = Sv \\\\) and \\\\( M(v) = Tv \\\\), with S and T being constant matrices. The system evolves according to the vector field defined by \\\\( L \\\\) initially, and we explore various modifications and impacts using the transformation \\\\( M \\\\).\n\nIf a vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0 is transformed by \\\\( M(v) = Tv \\\\) and then evolved under \\\\( L(v) = Sv \\\\) without further intervention, will the vector at t = T, denoted \\\\( v(T) \\\\), coincide with the trajectory of \\\\( v_0 \\\\) directly evolved under \\\\( L \\\\) for the same period?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( M(v) \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( v_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Tv_0 \\\\), and if \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) do not commute, then the evolution of \\\\( Tv_0 \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\) will diverge from that of \\\\( v_0 \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\) alone, leading to different final states at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
