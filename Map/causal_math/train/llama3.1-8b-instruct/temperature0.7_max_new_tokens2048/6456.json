  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\(\\partial_t u = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) applied to the function \\(u(x, 0)\\) at \\(t = 0\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\(u(x, T)\\), can we determine accurately which transforms were applied (Fourier, Laplace, or both), based solely on \\(u(x, T)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlaps in potential transformations effects and their impact on how \\(L\\) operates makes it analytically infeasible to uniquely isolate whether \\(u(x, T)\\) is the result of one transform, both, or none, especially considering non-linear and non-trivial interactions between transformations and the operator \\(L\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, 0) → u(x, T); u(x, 0) → Fourier transform; u(x, 0) → Laplace transform; Fourier transform → u(x, T); Laplace transform → u(x, T); u(x, T) → u(x, T)"
