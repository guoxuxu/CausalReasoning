  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a two-dimensional space, \\(\\Delta u = 0\\), where \\(u(x,y)\\) is the potential function. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to convert the problem into its frequency domain representation, allowing analytical manipulation by \\(\\mathcal{F}[u](k_x, k_y) = U(k_x, k_y)\\).\n\nIf, at a certain future time, the function \\(u(x,y)\\) is intentionally modified (via an introduced function \\(v(x, y)\\)) before applying a Fourier transform, will \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\) depend only on the original \\(u(x,y)\\) and not on \\(v(x, y)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\(v(x, y)\\) modifies the underlying function \\(u(x, y)\\), affecting the result of the Fourier transformation, thus \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\) becomes dependent on both the original \\(u(x,y)\\) and the intervening function \\(v(x,y)\\). The Fourier transform reflects all changes in the spatial domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
