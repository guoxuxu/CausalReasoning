  "Problem": "Consider the system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\Delta u\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diffusion constant and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. This equation is initially transformed by \\\\( v(x, t_0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x, t_0) e^{ikx} dx \\\\), which represents the Fourier transform at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( v(x, t_0) \\\\) is performed at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\Delta u\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) of the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at any later time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) had been directly evolved to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) under the given PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution to the diffusion equation, \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{-Dk^2t}v(x, t_0) \\\\), depends only on the initial transform and the properties of the PDE. Regardless of the initial state or transformations, the diffusion process characteristically smears out differences over time, preserving the transform effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
