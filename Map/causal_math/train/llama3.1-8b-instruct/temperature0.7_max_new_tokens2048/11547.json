  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Fourier Transform applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, which is then subjected to operations described by a differential equation \\\\( L[g(x)] = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dx^2} - k^2g \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is subject to a transformation by another function \\\\( h(x) = xg(x) \\\\) at a specific point in time and then the differential equation is solved, will the final solution in the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) remain unaffected by this transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the original function, thus changing how it is represented in both the spatial and frequency domain. The differential equation will subsequently be operating on a different function, leading to a transformed \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\), which will reflect this change induced by \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
