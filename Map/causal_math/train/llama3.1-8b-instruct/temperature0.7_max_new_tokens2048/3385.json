  "Problem": "Consider a space of functions transformed by the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), where an input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is converted into its Laplacian \\\\(F(s)\\\\). Examining how modifying functions with the multiplication by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant) affects inference and predictive capabilities in this transformed domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is multiplied by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) prior to applying the Laplace Transform, resulting in \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at} f(t))(s)\\\\), will the resultant transformation differ from \\\\(F(s-a)\\\\) (where \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s)\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The property of the Laplace Transform states that multiplying \\\\(f(t)\\\\) by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) in time domain corresponds to a shift in the complex plane, resulting in \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at} f(t)) = F(s-a)\\\\). Therefore, the transformation indeed produces a shifted Laplacian, not merely an equivalent form of the original.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "multiplication by e^(at) → change in f(t); change in f(t) → modification in Laplace Transform; modification in Laplace Transform → difference in resultant transformation; a → value of the constant; value of the constant → change in e^(at); change in e^(at) → multiplication by e^(at)"
