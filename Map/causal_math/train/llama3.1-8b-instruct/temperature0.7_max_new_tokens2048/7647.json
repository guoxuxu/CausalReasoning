  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\( A \\) is a linear operator and \\( b \\) is a vector. We examine how the transformation and its inversion, where applicable, affect behavior over the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{cz} \\\\), with \\( c \\) being a constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain point an intervention modifies \\( A \\) to \\( A' \\), does the transformed output at this time independently determine the behavior of the system henceforth, irrespective of previous states or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Even after the modification of \\( A \\) to \\( A' \\), the output depends on all previous transformations and inputs. The behavior of \\( e^{cz} \\) and how it interacts with \\( A \\) and \\( A' \\) means the system's subsequent state reflects its entire history, not just the post-intervention configuration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
