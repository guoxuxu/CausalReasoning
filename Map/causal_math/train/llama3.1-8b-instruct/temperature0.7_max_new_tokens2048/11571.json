  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = L(h(t))  = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). We analyze the effect of modifying this system by convolution with another function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(t) = e^{ct} \\\\) is convolved as an intervention, will the resulting function's Laplace transform at s, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), depend only on the original Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and not on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( K(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening convolution with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) further modifies the system, introducing an additional factor that influences the final Laplace transform. The result, \\\\( Z(s) = H(s-b-c) \\\\), depends on the original transform as well as the modifications introduced by both convolutions, reflecting the shifts introduced by \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
