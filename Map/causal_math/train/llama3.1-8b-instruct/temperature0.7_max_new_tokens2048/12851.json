  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a system exhibiting harmonic motion in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-s\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine whether an intervention occurred at any \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The calculation of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) integrates the effect of the system state over time with a decay factor, diminishing specific features of interventions. Multiple different interventions could lead to similar or indistinguishable results in the transformed output, thus preventing a unique determination.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
