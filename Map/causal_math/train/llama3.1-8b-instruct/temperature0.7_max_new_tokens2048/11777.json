  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time linear system controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Consider the application of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nx} \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, and study its effects over time.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the initial configuration \\\\( x_0 \\\\), unaware whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), determining the initial state directly from the end state is nontrivial. The potential changes caused by \\\\( e^{Nx} \\\\) could vary in transformation effects, significantly altering the trajectory starting points uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
