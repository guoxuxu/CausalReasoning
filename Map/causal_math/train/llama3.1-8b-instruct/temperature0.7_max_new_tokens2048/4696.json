  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state vector. We investigate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix, applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) throughout the timeline?",
  "Explanation": "The interpretation of interventions leading to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be ambiguous because different sequences and combinations of transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) can mimic each other's effects when they work concurrently with the system dynamics under matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The non-unique effects of matrix exponentials further complicate the unambiguous determination of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
