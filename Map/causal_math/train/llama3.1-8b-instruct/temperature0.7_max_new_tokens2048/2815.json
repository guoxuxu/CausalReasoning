  "Problem": "We consider the scenario of an electrical circuit with a complex impedance function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain, where \\\\(s\\\\) represents the complex frequency. The causal relationship between voltage input \\\\(V(s)\\\\) and current output \\\\(I(s)\\\\) is given by \\\\(I(s) = \\\\frac{V(s)}{Z(s)}\\\\). We explore the transformations introduced by connecting an additional impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) in parallel and series configurations within the circuit.\n\nIf at a specific point a new impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) is added in parallel to the existing \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), will the resulting impedance of the circuit depend only on \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) and not on \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Connecting a new impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) in parallel fundamentally modifies the total impedance of the circuit. The resulting impedance can be calculated as \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{Z(s)} + \\\\frac{1}{Z_1(s)}}\\\\). The contributions from both \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) and \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) determine the new impedance, making it depend on both components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
