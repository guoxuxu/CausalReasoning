  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is different from \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the final transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) be affected solely by the new \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not by the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) will reflect both the impact of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the new \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). The transformation accumulates contributions from both intervals: from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T governed by \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Thus, it is dependent on both values.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
