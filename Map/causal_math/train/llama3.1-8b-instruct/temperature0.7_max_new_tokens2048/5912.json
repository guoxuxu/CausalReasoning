  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function z on an integral transformation defined by the integral operator T, where \\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\) over a contour \\( \\\\gamma \\) in the complex plane. Here, z is a complex number and \\( f(t) \\) is a function of the complex variable t.\n\nAfter observing an output from \\( T[f](z) \\) and knowing an intervention modified f(t), can we exactly pinpoint what the initial function f(t) was and the type of intervention applied solely based on the output?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple functions or different interventions could yield the same or similar output for a given z in the transformation \\( T[f](z) \\), particularly because the nature of complex exponential functions can mask unique characteristics of initial conditions in the integration, leading to indistinguishable results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
