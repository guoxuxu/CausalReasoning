  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = ze^{z} \\\\) and its Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation and its ability to highlight causality within the calculations.\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after observing the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without additional data on whether a preliminary modification like \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the initial modification \\\\( g(z) \\\\), we cannot unequivocally determine the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Multiple functions can share the same or similar transformations, particularly when changes to the function occur before transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
