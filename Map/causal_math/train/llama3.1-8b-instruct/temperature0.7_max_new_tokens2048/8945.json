  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a complex constant vector. This scenario investigates the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{iBt}w \\\\) where B is also a real constant, and how it modifies the system's dynamics over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(w) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(w) \\\\) modifies the initial vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\), influencing the vector's phase and potentially its magnitude depending on B and the initial vector orientation. This alteration changes the starting conditions of the dynamics brought forth by \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\). The resulting state at any t = T would differ unless B and A are specifically aligned or proportional.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
