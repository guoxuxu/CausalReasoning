  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\}(s) = F(s)\\\\). We evaluate how a convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) impacts the transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nGiven only the transformed output \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\), the exact recovery of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) becomes impossible because the shift induced by \\\\( a \\\\) in the transform cannot be accurately inverted to regain \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
