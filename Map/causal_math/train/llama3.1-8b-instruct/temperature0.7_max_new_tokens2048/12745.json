  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, defined by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T(u)(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\) used in the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) cannot be precisely determined from \\\\( T(u)(t) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\), as \\\\( s \\\\) influences the modes and weights captured by the integral transformation, affecting the inverse operation's accuracy and specificity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
