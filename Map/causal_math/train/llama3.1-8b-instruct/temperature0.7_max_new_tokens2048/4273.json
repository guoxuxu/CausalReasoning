  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\(L[z] = z' + az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{ct}z\\\\) on this system, where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(L[z]\\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be unaffected by the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) modifies the initial condition, changing the trajectory of the system. Since the transformation \\\\(e^{ct}\\\\) scales the function, this alteration will influence the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time \\\\(T\\\\), resulting in a state that depends on both \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
