  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the flow (\\\\( f(x) \\\\)) through a nonlinear system is described by a complex function \\\\( f(x) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z = Ax + B \\\\), and A, B are matrices. We examine the impact of an integral transformation applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\): (\\\\( T[g(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ixt} g(x) dx \\\\)), for a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\).\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(x) = F(x) \\\\), defined as the standard transformation of \\\\( x \\\\) by \\\\( F \\\\), a linear operator, is used initially and then \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is subject to \\\\( T \\\\) without further modification, will the transformation outcome \\\\( T[f(x)] \\\\) be the same as applying \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( F(x) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The nonlinear transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{iz} \\\\) will modify the input \\\\( x \\\\) in a way that changes the features of the function, making \\\\( f(F(x)) \\\\) substantially different from \\\\( F(f(x)) \\\\). Therefore, the integral transformation applied afterward will yield different results due to the nonlinearity introduced.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
