  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. We are interested in the causality implications of an integral transformation applied to initial conditions given by some function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) related to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a Laplace transform.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing it to \\\\( v(t) = t u(t) \\\\), does \\\\( h(v(t)) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) for all \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and not on the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to be transformed, which directly affects the result of \\\\( h(v(t)) \\\\). The dependency on \\\\( t \\\\) introduced by the intervention means the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\) is altered, reflecting both the original function and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
