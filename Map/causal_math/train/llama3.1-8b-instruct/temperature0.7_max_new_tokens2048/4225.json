  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformation affect the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T?",
  "Explanation": "The differential equation continues to govern the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) independently of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), which only impacts how the historical values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T are integrated and weighted. The transformation doesn't modify the ongoing evolution according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
