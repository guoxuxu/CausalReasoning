  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = f\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\), with \\\\(f\\\\) representing a source term. This domain undergoes a transformation \\\\(T\\\\) that maps it to a new domain \\\\(D'\\\\). The transformation changes how the system responds over time.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(u\\\\) in the transformed domain \\\\(D'\\\\), can we exactly infer the solution in the original domain \\\\(D\\\\) without knowing the specifics of the transformation \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise information about the transformation \\\\(T\\\\), reversing the effects to deduce the original solution in \\\\(D\\\\) is impractical. The transformation could involve complex geometric alterations affecting how \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = f\\\\) is resolved, making exact inference problematic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
