  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number frequency parameter. This function represents a complex exponential oscillation. Analyze the transformation with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), will the resulting Fourier transform be dependent solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alters the original function to \\\\( e^{i (\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)} \\\\). Although the dominant frequency in the Fourier spectrum will still be \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the phase shift introduces a complex multiplier \\\\( e^{i \\\\phi} \\\\) affecting the entire transformed function by shifting its phase, hence it depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
