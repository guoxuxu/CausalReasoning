  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex square matrix, binding the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of a complex variable. We analyze the behavior when applying a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the output from the Laplace transform, can we determine whether the matrix was initially \\\\( A \\\\) or changed to \\\\( B \\\\) during transformation, just by examining the result?",
  "Explanation": "The result of a Laplace transform, especially if the system matrix was changed during transformation, can correspond to multiple potential scenarios with different matrices. Without additional context or constraints, the output alone does not suffice to determine the specifics of the matrix used during transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
