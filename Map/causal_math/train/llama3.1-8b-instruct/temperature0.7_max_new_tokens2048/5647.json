  "Problem": "Consider an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = -ky(t) + \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\lambda (t-s)} y(s) ds \\\\), where k and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. This models a system where the rate of change of \\\\( y \\\\) depends on both its current state and a weighted integral of its history.\n\nIf an intervention changing the parameter \\\\( k \\\\) to a new constant \\\\( k' \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( k' \\\\) and not on the previous parameter \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( k' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will alter the future dynamics of the system, but the solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) beyond this point still depends on values from its past as integrated by the exponential kernel, which is influenced by both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The entire history and the change in parameters collectively influence the solution post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
