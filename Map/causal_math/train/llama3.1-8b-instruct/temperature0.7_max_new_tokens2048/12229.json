  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of signals transformed by the Laplace Transform S defined as \\\\( S[f(t)] = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). Consider the impact on a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} + ax = b \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants. Examine scenarios where the signal is either altered by a modulation or operation defined as \\\\( g(t) = t f(t) \\\\) and then further transformations.\n\nIf the transformed representation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) from the Laplace Transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is observed, can we uniquely infer the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t f(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) alone without clear information whether it is derived from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) = t f(t) \\\\), makes it impossible to uniquely infer \\\\( f(t) \\\\). This is due to the additional derivative term in \\\\( G(s) = -F'(s) \\\\), making the recovery of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and thus \\\\( f(t) \\\\) uncertain without further context.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
