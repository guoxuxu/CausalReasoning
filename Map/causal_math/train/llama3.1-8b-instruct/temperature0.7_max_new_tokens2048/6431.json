  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex vector. The function is subject to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[w(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}w(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix.\n\nIf an intervention is performed by applying another transformation \\\\( U[v(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct}v(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be solely determined by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) not considering matrices \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the intervention \\\\( U[v(t)] \\\\) introduces additional dynamics to the system, thus the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) will be influenced by the matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\), due to their respective roles in shaping the function's evolution and the resultant transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
