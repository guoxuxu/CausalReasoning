  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int \\\\frac{f(w)}{w - z} dw \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is an analytic function defined on a complex domain excluding the point z. The integral is calculated over a closed contour enclosing z. We want to infer changes and effects of applying transformations based on the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nAfter observing the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine whether the contour was transformed by the function \\\\( h(w) \\\\) prior to integration?",
  "Explanation": "Since the rotation of the contour does not change the value of the integral for an analytic function within the contour, it is impossible to infer whether such a transformation by \\\\( h(w) \\\\) occurred just by analyzing the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
