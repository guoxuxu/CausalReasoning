  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is a constant vector. We evaluate the impact of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) at time t, where E is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on D and not on E or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces additional modifications, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on E, F, as well as D. The interactions between these transformations can change the trajectory and endpoint distinctly due to possible non-commutative properties among the matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
