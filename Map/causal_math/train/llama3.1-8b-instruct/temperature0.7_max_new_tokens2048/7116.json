  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the influence of a transformation characterized by the function \\\\( t(x) = \\\\int e^{sx} ds \\\\) on spatial variable x, where s represents a parameter.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we explicitly determine the interventions used (whether \\\\( t(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) could potentially result from different combinations of transformations and interventions due to the complex interplay and overlap in their effects. This complicates the ability to uniquely backtrack to specific interventions without additional context or constraints on their application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
