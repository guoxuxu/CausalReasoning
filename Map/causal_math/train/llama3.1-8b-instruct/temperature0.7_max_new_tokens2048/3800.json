  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 2 \\\\) and its Laplace Transform, which transforms the function into the s-domain as \\\\( F(s) \\\\). We explore whether the transformed system under differently parameterized transformations still retains causal relationships.\n\nKnowing the final transformed function in the s-domain, can we discern whether the transformation was purely \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or included the intervention \\\\( G(s) \\\\), solely based on the outcome observed in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of transformations in the s-domain and potential equivalence in outcomes from different pathways or interventions (such as linear additions like \\\\( G(s) = s \\\\)) make it impossible to definitively conclude the presence or absence of specific interventions without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
