  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation applied is \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) only by knowing the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) contains intricacies from potential combinations of both transformations and original trajectory. The same final state could result from different timing, intensities, or even types of interventions, rendering precise identification of the specific transformations used impossible based solely on \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
