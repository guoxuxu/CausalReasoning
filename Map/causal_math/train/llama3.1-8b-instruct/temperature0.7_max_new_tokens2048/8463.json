  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of linear operators \\\\( L \\\\) on this system, defined by matrix multiplication on complex numbers in the form \\\\( Lz = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another linear operator \\\\( L' \\\\) defined by \\\\( L'z = Nz \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The series of transformations and evolution means that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) besides \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Specifically, the state at time T will be \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega (T-t_1)}N e^{i\\\\omega t_1}Mz_0 \\\\), which depends on the interplay between \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and the evolution operator.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
