  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a continuous function on the interval [0, T], and s is a complex scalar. We are interested to determine how transformations to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) like \\\\( f(x) = f(x) + g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is another continuous function, impacts the resulting function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) as \\\\( f'(x) = f(x) + g(x) \\\\), and then we compute \\\\( z'(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} f'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), will \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if computed from original \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) changes the function being integrated. This modification alters the values of the integral of the function over time, leading to a different outcome for \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) in comparison to the original \\\\( z(T) \\\\) computed without the addition of \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
