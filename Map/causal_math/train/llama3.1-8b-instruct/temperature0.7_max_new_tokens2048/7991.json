  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which represents a unit circle in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer, on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying another function \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\) at time t_1 is made, will this affect the fundamental nature of the trajectory as a circle in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "This subsequent transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\), applied after an initial \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), results in \\\\( z(t) = (e^{int})^m = e^{imnt} \\\\) for t > t_1. While this changes the frequency by multiplying the original frequency by m, the inherent geometric nature as a unit circle remains unchanged. Thus, the trajectory remains a circle, though its frequency of traversal changes again.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
