  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant, is applied.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\), can we ascertain exactly what modifications (original transformation \\\\( F \\\\), differential modification \\\\( Cz \\\\), or both) were performed, solely based on the outcome at T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integrated and compounded nature of the transformations (both initial transformation \\\\( F \\\\) and differential intervention \\\\( Cz \\\\)), multiple combinations of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) can potentially lead to similar or indistinguishable outcomes at \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\). This overlap makes it impossible to uniquely determine the specific interventions applied throughout the interval solely based on the endpoint result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
