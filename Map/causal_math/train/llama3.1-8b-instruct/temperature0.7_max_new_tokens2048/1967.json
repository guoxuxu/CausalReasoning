  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) refers to time. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the function and consider intervention through an inverse Laplace transform at different times.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) corresponding to multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) is applied after performing the Laplace transform and before applying the inverse Laplace transform, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) still be recovered normally?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the system through the multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), which modifies the Laplace transform to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\). The resulting function from the inverse Laplace transform will then be \\\\( e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha) t} \\\\), not the original \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "time t → function z(t); constant ω → function z(t); Laplace transform → transformed function; transformation γ → modified transformed function; inverse Laplace transform → function z(t); α → transformation γ; α → modified transformed function; γ → function z(t)"
