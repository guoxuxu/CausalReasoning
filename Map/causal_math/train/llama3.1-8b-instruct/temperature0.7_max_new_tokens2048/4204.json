  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or both), strictly from knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after the application of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from endpoint values is complicated by the overlapping effects of the transformations and the underlying dynamics. Even if \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is known, the non-commutative nature of the employed transformations (integral and additional matrix sum) renders the deduction of specific interventions ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
