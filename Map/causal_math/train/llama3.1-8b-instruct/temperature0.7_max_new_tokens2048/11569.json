  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = L(h(t))  = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). We analyze the effect of modifying this system by convolution with another function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to form \\\\( y(t) = (h * g)(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural properties without further intervention, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), be the same as if \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was not convolved with \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) results in a transformed function whose Laplace transform is based on a product: \\\\( Y(s) = H(s-b) \\\\). This shift in the domain by \\\\( b \\\\) alters the characteristics of the transformed function, making it fundamentally different from \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
