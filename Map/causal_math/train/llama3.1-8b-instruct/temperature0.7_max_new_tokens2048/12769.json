  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and s is a complex parameter. We explore the causal inference between varying the parameter s and its effect on the transformed function F(s).\n\nIf we observe that the value of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) increases, can we conclude that s was decreased from a higher to a lower value without any permutations in f(t)?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) indicates that the suppression factor \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) weakens, which can only occur if s decreases, making it less repressive and thus increasing the integral value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
