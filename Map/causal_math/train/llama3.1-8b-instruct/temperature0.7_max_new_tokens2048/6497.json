  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) a complex vector. We explore how the system evolves under the operation of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition is transformed by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) without further interventions, will the final transformed state be equivalent to transforming the system at a later time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alters the initial state, and under the Laplace transform, the system will take on properties of both the evolutionary dynamics and the structure of A, deviating significantly from a situation where the initial state is simply evolved to time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
