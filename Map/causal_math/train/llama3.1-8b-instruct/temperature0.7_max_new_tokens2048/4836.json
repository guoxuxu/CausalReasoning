  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Analyze the impact of the Laplace transform on this function, particularly when modified by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{st}z(t) \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, can we determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by examining the transformed function?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, particularly with overlapping exponential interventions (like \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{ut} \\\\)), can result in similar transform outcomes for different parameters s and u. This overlap makes it inherently challenging to uniquely decipher which interventions occurred or their exact parameters, given only the transformed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
