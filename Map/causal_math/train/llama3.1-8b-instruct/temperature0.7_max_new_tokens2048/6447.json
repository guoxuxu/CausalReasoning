  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where the function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\) represents the transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The impact of a linear operator \\\\( A \\\\) acting on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(t) = A f(t) \\\\) is being analyzed, where the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t))(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by another operator \\\\( B \\\\) is applied at a specific time converting \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) = Bg(t) \\\\), will the final Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\( B \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, making the final transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The actions of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) in the time domain collectively influence the resultant s-domain representation, demonstrating the dependency on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
