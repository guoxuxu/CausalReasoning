  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Examine the influence of introducing an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int k(x, y)u(y)dy \\\\) where \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based on the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) without further details is challenging due to the overlapping influences of the integral transformations. The alterations induced by kernel k and m might produce similar or indistinguishable effects on u(T), thus obscuring the clarity of which transformations were actually applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
