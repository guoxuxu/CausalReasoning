  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We study the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Ce^{Bt}z \\\\), where B and C are also complex matrices.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the vector is evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without any further modification, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T differ from direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially modifies the vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\) before its evolution, making the path of the vector dependent on matrix C as well as B through its exponential influence over time. This results in a trajectory that cannot be obtained by merely evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
