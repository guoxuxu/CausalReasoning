  "Problem": "Investigate a system under the effect of a linear transformation expressed through the matrix exponential. The system is defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, and the impact of transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), by only observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations or timing of interventions due to the properties of matrix exponentials and their non-commutative nature affecting the resulting trajectories. The overlap in potential states resulting makes it impossible to unequivocally deduce the history of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
