  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was merely subjected to evolution until t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially modifies the complex variable, thus altering the trajectory of the function. The influence of \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) can change the dynamic behavior of the system depending on how \\\\( Q \\\\) interacts with \\\\( P \\\\), leading to a different complex number at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
