  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-s^2} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) represents an input function. We study the role of transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) on input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and observe its impact over the interval [0, a].\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( y(a) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) influences the outcome of the integral transformation in such a way that the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved from the result \\\\( y(a) \\\\) without additional information about the usage of \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
