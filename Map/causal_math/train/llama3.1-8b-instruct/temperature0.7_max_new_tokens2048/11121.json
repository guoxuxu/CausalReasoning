  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an inductor L and resistor R in series connected to an alternating voltage source given by \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The voltage across the inductor is described by the equation \\\\( V_L = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} \\\\) and the resistor by \\\\( V_R = RI \\\\). We study the effect of altering the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the source on the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) in the circuit.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the voltage source is increased from \\\\(\\\\omega_0\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega_1\\\\), without any intervention, will the amplitude of the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) enhances the reactance of the inductor, \\\\( X_L = \\\\omega L \\\\), which increases the overall impedance \\\\( Z = \\\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\\\omega L)^2} \\\\). Higher impedance reduces the amplitude of the current, \\\\( I_0 = V_0 / Z \\\\), thus decreasing the current amplitude as frequency increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
