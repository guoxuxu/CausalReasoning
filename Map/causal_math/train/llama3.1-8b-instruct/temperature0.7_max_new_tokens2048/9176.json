  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit where the input voltage \\\\(V_{in}(t)\\\\) is related to the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) via a transfer function defined by \\\\( I(t) = K \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(s-t)} V_{in}(s) ds \\\\), where K and A are constants.\n\nCan we precisely identify what changes were made to A (with or without constant \\\\( C \\\\)) based solely on the observation of \\\\( I(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral in the transfer function results in a state dependent on the entire history of both \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) and parameter changes in A. Disambiguating the influence of modifications to A merely from the final current at \\\\( I(T) \\\\) is not feasible without additional information about the input voltage history and all parameter changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
