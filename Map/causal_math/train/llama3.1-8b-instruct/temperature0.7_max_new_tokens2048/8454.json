  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Assume \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and x is a constant vector. Let the impact of an operational matrix B be scrutinized via the transformation \\\\( h(s) = B \\\\cdot g(s) \\\\) where B commutes with A.\n\nGiven \\\\( h(s) \\\\), and knowing it resulted from an operation on the Laplace transform of some \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) by matrix B, can we conclude the specific structure or elements of B without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of specific detail about the Laplace transform and the general form of B and A—other than their commutative property—makes it impossible to reconstruct the exact characteristics of B. The transformation via commutative matrices leaves multiple possibilities open.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
