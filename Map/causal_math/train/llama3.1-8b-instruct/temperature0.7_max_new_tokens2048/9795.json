  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\(dz = Pz \\, dt\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. Investigate the implications of applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\) over time \\(t\\), with \\(Q\\) also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), we apply another intervention \\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\) (where \\( R \\) is another constant matrix), does the resulting state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) rely only on \\( P \\) and not \\( Q \\) or \\( R \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventional application of \\( h(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces an additional altering vector flow. Consequently, the final state \\( z(T) \\) will be a function of \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), and \\( R \\). The transformations \\( e^{Qt} \\) and \\( e^{Rt} \\) affect the system's trajectory, imparting dependency from all matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
