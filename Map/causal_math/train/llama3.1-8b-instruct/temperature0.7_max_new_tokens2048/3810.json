  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the integral transformation \\\\(Y(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} y(t) dt\\\\), where y(t) is a complex function and s is a complex variable. We explore the effects of a differential operator \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\) and how it acts on y(t) before and after the transformation.\n\nIf the transformed function \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) is given, can we accurately determine \\\\(y(0)\\\\) without additional information about the pre-transformation state of y(t)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) provides comprehensive encoding of y(t) in the Laplace domain, extracting precisely \\\\(y(0)\\\\) requires inverse transformation and knowledge about the behavior of y(t) near t=0, which cannot be definitively resolved just from \\\\(Y(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
