  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its related complex function transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). We examine the impact of these transformations on the integration path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the integral result of \\\\( \\\\int_C g(f(z)) dz \\\\) for some contour C, can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or the original path without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's not possible to accurately trace back to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or the original integration path, as \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could dramatically alter the characteristics and path of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
