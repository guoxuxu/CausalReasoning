  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, resistor, and capacitor arranged in series (RLC circuit). The voltage across the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L, R, C \\\\) are constants and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is the input voltage function. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to the input voltage function.\n\nGiven the observed current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine the form of intervention on \\\\( V(t) \\\\) (specifically, if \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) or its inverse was applied), based solely on the current observation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity introduced by transformation and inverse transformation in the Laplace domain, multiple modifications to \\\\( V(t) \\\\) could result in the same or similar current paths. Therefore, it is not possible to uniquely identify specific interventions on \\\\( V(t) \\\\) only based on the current measurement.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
