  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its influence on a real function defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}F(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex variable. We analyze how transformations and interventions using a separate complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) affect the output of g(x).\n\nIf a separate transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^z \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at a specific \\\\( z_1 \\\\) during the computation of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will the final result of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) depend solely on the application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) without considering the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces a non-trivial transformation of the input, affecting the integrand in \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Since \\\\( e^z \\\\) can significantly alter the behavior near poles and essential singularities, the resultant computation will indeed depend on both the function \\\\( F \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
