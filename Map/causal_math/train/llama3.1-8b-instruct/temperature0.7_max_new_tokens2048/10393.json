  "Problem": "Consider a discrete-time system governed by the equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\\\), where \\\\( f(x) = A x \\\\) with A being a square matrix. We also use a linear operator \\\\( T(x) = B x \\\\), where B is another square matrix, to transform the initial state.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( T(x) \\\\) to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and subsequently let the system evolve according to \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x_N \\\\) at time step N be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to step N under the same system equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( B x_0 \\\\). The new trajectory starting from \\\\( B x_0 \\\\) is evolved by repeated applications of A, resulting in \\\\( A^N B x_0 \\\\). This differs from \\\\( A^N x_0 \\\\) unless A and B commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
