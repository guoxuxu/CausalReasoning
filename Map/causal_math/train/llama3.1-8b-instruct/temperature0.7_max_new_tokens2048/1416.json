  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to periodic external force, modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = f(t)\\\\) where p and q are constants and \\\\(f(t)\\\\) represents the forcing term. We examine the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Ax^2 \\\\) to the state x, where A is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can it be inferred with certainty which transformations (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were initially applied, just by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specifically which transformations were applied based solely on the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is generally impossible due to the non-linearity introduced by the transformations and potential similarities in the resultant states from different initial applications. Without additional constraints or information, the final state can be reached from varying initial transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
