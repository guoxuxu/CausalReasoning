  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We study the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) being another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nFrom observing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine if the original system evolved naturally from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) had been applied without previous knowledge of the use of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial control (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied or not) purely from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible because different parameters \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and commencements \\\\( t \\\\) of transformation application could lead to similar end states, particularly given the complex exponential nature of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
