  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an unknown time-domain function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its image in the complex frequency domain. The effect of a complex function \\\\( G(s) = s^2 + 1 \\\\) is to transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) into \\\\( G(s)F(s) \\\\) representing a modification in the frequency domain.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( G(s)F(s) \\\\) is applied to the original transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and then it is left to evolve without additional transformations, will the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{G(s)F(s)\\\\} \\\\) at time t be equivalent to the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( G(s) \\\\) alters the Laplace image, resulting in a different time-domain function when taking the inverse transform. This change reflects as a modification in the behavior or characteristics of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
