  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transformation. Analyzing the behavior between the Laplacian and Fourier transformations of the function as it manifests in the complex domain.\n\nSupposing an additional operation is performed on the function after the Fourier transform—say a convolution with another function in the time domain—will the outcome in the s-domain still directly reflect the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) processed by these transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution modifies the function's characteristics by integrating another function's influence, changing the outcome in the s-domain significantly. This transformation does not preserve the original properties encoded by \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
