  "Problem": "Examine the causality in a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are considering the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an operation described by another transformation, such as a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on L and not on the Fourier or Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The interventional application of the Laplace transform introduces a new complexity to the system, remodeling the state's spectrum and making the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) dependent not only on L but also on the specific characteristics of both the Fourier and Laplace transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
