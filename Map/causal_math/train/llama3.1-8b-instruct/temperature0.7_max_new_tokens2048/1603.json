  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\) based on a fixed complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number. This dynamic is influenced by performing different integral transformations on \\\\( z \\\\) over time.\n\nIf an intervention defined by another integral transformation \\\\( S \\\\) where \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^2 z e^{-t} dt \\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_0 > 0 \\\\), will the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\) depend only on the function \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the characteristics of \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S \\\\) alters the trajectory of the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) imposed by the first transformation \\\\( T \\\\), and thus the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) depends on both transformations, \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), in addition to the influence of the complex function \\\\( f \\\\). This results in a compounded effect, influenced by each transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
