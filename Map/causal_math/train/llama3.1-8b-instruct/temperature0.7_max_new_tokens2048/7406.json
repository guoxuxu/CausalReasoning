  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how the convolution of another function, \\\\( h(t) \\\\), impacts g(t) in terms of their transforms. Assume both functions are well-behaved and their transforms exist.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the convolution \\\\( L[g(t) * h(t)] \\\\), can we accurately determine the individual functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the product of the Laplace Transforms of two functions does not uniquely identify the individual functions due to potential multiple factorizations, particularly without additional information on g(t) or h(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
