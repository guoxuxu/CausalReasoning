  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represent a complex function governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Consider the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then exploring the causal relationships between different transformations applied to \\\\( z \\\\) at various times.\n\nCan we revert to the precise initial form \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by inverse transforming \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) back to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), without knowing the specifics of the transformation applied (e.g., the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform requires knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to accurately reconstruct the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Without this, the phase and frequency characteristics embedded in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) hinder accurate reconstruction of the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
