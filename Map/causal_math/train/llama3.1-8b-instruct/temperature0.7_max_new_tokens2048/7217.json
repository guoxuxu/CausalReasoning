  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over the interval from 0 to T without further intervention, will \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) be equivalent to simply integrating \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over the same interval without applying \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) effectively alters the function to be integrated by weighting it with \\\\(e^{-i\\\\omega s}\\\\), which is a modulation of the frequency. This changes the result of the integral, specifically neutralizing the effect of the exponential term present in \\\\(z(t)\\\\), and is not the same as the unweighted integral of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
