  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\( g(x) \\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely recover \\( x_0 \\) just from \\( x(t) \\) at t = T. The transformation \\( Q^{-1} \\) could have modified \\( x_0 \\) to a new state that evolves differently under \\( K \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
