  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{1} e^{tz} dt \\\\) is applied, which modifies subsystem behaviors dynamically.\n\nGiven the final transformed state post-intervention, can we accurately determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and the specific transformations (whether K, M, or both) used?",
  "Explanation": "Given the compounded transformations first by K and then by M, and further modified by the integral operation, tracing back to the exact sequence and types of interventions (K and M) from the final state involves resolving multiple non-linear mappings, which is typically not unique. The multiple layers of complexity in calculation prevent a precise inverse mapping from the final state to the initial states and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
