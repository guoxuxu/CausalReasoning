  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is a given kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is the input function. Analyze the behavior when applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is another function.\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the input was originally \\\\( x(s) \\\\) or \\\\( g(x(s)) \\\\), without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) was applied, the observed output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to distinctly infer whether the original input was \\\\( x(s) \\\\) or altered via \\\\( g(x(s)) \\\\). Both inputs could potentially yield the same observed outcome depending on the form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
