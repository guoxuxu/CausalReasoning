  "Problem": "Explore the system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with a given constant matrix M. Consider the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and how different initial conditions affect the system. We assume M and s are such that all operations and the inverse transform are well-defined.\n\nIf an intervention changes the matrix M to a new matrix N at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), and we continue to observe \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), does the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depend only on the initial condition, independent of the change in the system matrix?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that changes M to N modifies the system dynamics. The effect of the matrix change alters the resultant state trajectory, thereby making \\\\(z(T)\\\\) dependent on the properties of both M and N, not solely on the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
