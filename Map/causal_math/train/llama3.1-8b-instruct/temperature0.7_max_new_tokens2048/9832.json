  "Problem": "Consider a system where the evolution of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The impact of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied to reach \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging without additional information about the intermediate states or exact knowledge of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The endpoint could potentially be achieved through various combinations of transformations and adjustments, making it ambiguous and indecipherable just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
