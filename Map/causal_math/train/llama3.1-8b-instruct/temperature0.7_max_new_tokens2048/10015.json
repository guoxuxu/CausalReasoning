  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on the solution, specifically, the operation defined by the function g(u) = F(u), where F denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(u) = F^{-1}(u) \\\\) (the inverse Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the initial application of F or F^{-1}?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(u) = F^{-1}(u) \\\\) changes the state back to the time-space domain, which reintroduces the initial dependencies on the Fourier transform properties and L. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is influenced by the transformations F and F^{-1}, together with how L operates in different domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
