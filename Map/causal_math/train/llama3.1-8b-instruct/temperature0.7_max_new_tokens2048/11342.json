  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x + iy) \\) that maps complex numbers \\( x + iy \\) to other complex numbers where \\( f \\) is a complex analytic function. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform of a derived real function \\( u(x, t) = \\text{Re}(f(x + it)) \\) over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\text{Re} \\) denotes the real part of the function.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( T(\\lambda) \\), can we retrieve the exact functional form of \\( u(x, t) \\) and hence \\( f(x + it) \\) without prior knowledge of boundary or initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(x, t)\\} \\), encodes the function into a different domain (s-domain) that aggregates the effect of \\( u(x, t) \\) over all times. However, retrieving the original \\( u(x, t) \\) (and consequently, \\( f(x + it) \\)) requires inverse transformations that generally also depend on knowledge of the boundary and initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "prior knowledge of boundary or initial conditions → knowledge of functional form of u(x, t); knowledge of functional form of u(x, t) → knowledge of functional form of f(x + it); Laplace transform of u(x, t) → T(λ); T(λ) → u(x, t); f(x + it) → u(x, t); knowledge of functional form of u(x, t) → retrieval of functional form of u(x, t)"
