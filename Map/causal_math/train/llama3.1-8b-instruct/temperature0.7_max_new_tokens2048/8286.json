  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), with \\\\( F(z) = Az + C \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and C is a constant vector. We analyze the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and its inverse \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) applied to this system over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from observing the transformed system \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(T) \\\\) at T without knowing the transformation applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation to the s-domain via \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) obscures the original time-domain characteristics of \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Without specifically knowing the transformation was the Laplace Transform, one cannot reliably reconstruct \\\\( z(0) \\\\) just from knowledge of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(T) \\\\) due to lack of information on how to properly revert the modifications imposed by the Laplace Transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
