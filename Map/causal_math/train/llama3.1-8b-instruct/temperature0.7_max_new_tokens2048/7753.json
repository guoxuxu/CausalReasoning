  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. Suppose an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt'} z(t') dt' \\\\) is applied, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is initially applied to the state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t be identical to a system which was not subjected to \\\\( T(z) \\\\) but just evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by integrating over the trajectory influenced by matrix N. The resulting state path depends on both M and N, causing divergent behavior from an untransformed system which evolves exclusively under M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
