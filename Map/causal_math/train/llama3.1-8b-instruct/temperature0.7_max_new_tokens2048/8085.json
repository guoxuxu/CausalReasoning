  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. The system's behavior is further explored through the application of a transformation represented by \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by a factor of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), affecting the trajectory over time. The evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) will then proceed from a modified initial state, deviating from the trajectory of an untransformed initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
