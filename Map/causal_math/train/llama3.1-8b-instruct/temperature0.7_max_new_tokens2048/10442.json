  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation modeled by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu(X_t, t) dt + \\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t\\\\), where \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) are functions of the state \\\\(X_t\\\\) and time t, and \\\\(W_t\\\\) represents a standard Brownian motion. We explore the effect of modifying the initial state by a deterministic transformation given by \\\\(h(X) = X + k\\\\), where k is a fixed constant.\n\nCan the original state \\\\(X_0\\\\) be precisely determined after observing the state \\\\(X(t)\\\\) at time t without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(X)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirming the application of the transformation \\\\(h(X)\\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\(X_0\\) because the shift by k could have altered the initial conditions. Knowledge of whether the transformation was applied is crucial to reconstructing the original state, as the differential terms also depend on the state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
