  "Problem": "A physical system's temperature distribution, u(x,t), satisfies the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + Ce^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where C and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants, is studied to evaluate its effect on the system.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 and letting it evolve under the heat equation change the temperature distribution at a later time t = T compared to just letting \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) evolve under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding \\\\( C \\\\) which evolves exponentially with time. This impacts the distribution, making it deviate from the path it would follow under the heat equation alone, accounting for the integration of the transformation over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
