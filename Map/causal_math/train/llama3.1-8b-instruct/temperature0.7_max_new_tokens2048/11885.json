  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the temperature \\( T \\) of a substance is related to its electrical resistance \\( R \\) through the equation \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( R_0 \\) are constants. An additional thermal experiment involves the application of a function \\( g(T) = T + \\Delta T \\), where \\( \\Delta T \\) is a constant temperature change.\n\nGiven \\( R(T) \\) at a time \\( T \\), can we accurately deduce the initial temperature without knowing if \\( g(T) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty regarding the application of \\( g(T) \\), the actual change in temperature \\( \\Delta T \\) remains unknown. This uncertainty directly affects the determination of the original temperature due to the exponential relationship in \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
