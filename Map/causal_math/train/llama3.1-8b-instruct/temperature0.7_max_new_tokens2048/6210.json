  "Problem": "Consider a functional analysis setting where a complex function \\\\(z(s) = e^{sZ}\\\\) transforms a variable \\\\(s\\\\), and \\\\(Z\\\\) is a complex matrix. The system then undergoes an integral transformation via the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt\\\\).\n\nBased on the outcome of \\\\(L\\\\{z(t)\\\\}\\\\), can the original transformation variable \\\\(s\\\\) be uniquely determined without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform produces a result dependent on the structure of \\\\(Z\\\\) and the integration process, but it does not inherently reveal the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) used in the transformation \\\\(z(s)\\\\) prior to undergoing \\\\(L\\\\). Retrieving \\\\(s\\\\) solely from \\\\(L\\\\{z(t)\\\\}\\\\) without additional constraints or data is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
