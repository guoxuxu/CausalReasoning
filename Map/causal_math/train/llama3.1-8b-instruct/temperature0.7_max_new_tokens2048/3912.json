  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation given by \\\\( z = F(x) \\\\) where \\\\( F \\\\) is an integral operator defined as \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\), and A is an exponent matrix. We are exploring the effect of a secondary operator \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} B(t)x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( B(t) \\\\) is another matrix function controlling the transformation's behavior.\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specifically identify whether the transformation was affected by \\\\( G(x) \\\\), by the penalizing matrix \\\\( C \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might come from various combinations of transformations and interventions. The non-linear and superimposing effects of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B(t) \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) make it infeasible to uniquely ascertain the specific influences or interventions made merely based on the endpoint result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
