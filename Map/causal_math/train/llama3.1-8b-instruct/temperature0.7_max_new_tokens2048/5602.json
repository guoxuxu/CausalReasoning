  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + u \\\\), with D being a constant matrix and u representing external control influences. We study the system behavior under the intervention of a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), where F is another constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 if it is unknown whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) can potentially alter initial states in ways that are not recoverable from observing the final state alone. The transformation could correspond to multiple possible initial conditions due to differences in how F interacts with D, making it impossible to unique back-calculate without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
