  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the complex variable. Determine how transformations by function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) at specific instances influence the behavior of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) over the complex plane.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at a final position \\\\( z_4 \\\\), is it possible to precisely deduce which transformations (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied at earlier positions?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects of the matrices when exponentiated and applied to different segments of z, multiple combinations of transformations could yield the same final state at \\\\( z_4 \\\\). This inherent ambiguity in complex transformations precludes determining the precise intervention sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
