  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\right) + q(x)y = \\\\lambda w(x)y \\\\), where \\\\( p(x), q(x), w(x) \\\\) are given functions and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is the eigenvalue. An integral transformation \\\\( T[y](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} k(x, t)y(t)dt \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T[y](x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) adhering to the Sturm-Liouville boundary conditions and then the function is evolved under the same Sturm-Liouville problem, will the transformed function still be a solution?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[y](x) \\\\) may not preserve the boundary conditions or the structure required by the Sturm-Liouville problem, altering how the function satisfies the differential equation. The eigenfunctions corresponding to \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) will likely change unless \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\) has specific properties related to the operators in the equation.",
