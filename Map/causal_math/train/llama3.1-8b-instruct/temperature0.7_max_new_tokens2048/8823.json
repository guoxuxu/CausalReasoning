  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the continuity equation \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) is the fluid density and \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is the velocity field. We examine the effect of a transformation represented by a complex function, \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\), on this flow over time period t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(\\\\rho) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\rho \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the same constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint density \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original continuity equation and not on the transformations \\\\( f \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(\\\\rho) \\\\), introducing a counter-phase to \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\), does not reset or negate the cumulative effect of the earlier velocity field transformation. Thus, the final density \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\) reflects the complex developments under both transformations, not merely the initial conditions or native dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
