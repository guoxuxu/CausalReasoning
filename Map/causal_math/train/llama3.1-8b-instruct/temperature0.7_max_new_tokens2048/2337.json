  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation where a signal x(t) is first converted to X(s) using the Laplace transformation. The transformed signal X(s) is then modified by a multiplicative function H(s), which acts as a system's transfer function. Finally, the modified signal Y(s) = H(s)X(s) is converted back to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transformation to yield y(t).\n\nIf the original signal x(t) changes slightly, will the resulting output y(t) after processing also exhibit a change?",
  "Explanation": "Since Y(s) is directly affected by X(s) through the relation Y(s) = H(s)X(s), a change in x(t) leading to variation in X(s) will necessarily modify Y(s), and subsequently, y(t) will change. The linear nature of both the Laplace transformation and the system's multiplication rule ensures that output variations are causally connected to input variations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
