  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nIf \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) as a change of basis, and then we solve the eigenvalue problem for \\\\( A \\\\) without altering \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( P \\\\), will \\\\( v(t) \\\\) still be an eigenvector of \\\\( A \\\\) under this new basis?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) merely represents a change of basis and does not alter the inherent properties of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) or its eigenvectors. The transformed vector will still align with the eigenspace of \\\\( A \\\\), just expressed in a different basis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying transformation g(v) → change of basis; change of basis → new eigenvectors; new eigenvectors → v(t) still an eigenvector of A; Matrix A and P not altered → no effect on eigenvalue problem; g(v) applied to v0 → new v; new v → new eigenvalue problem; new eigenvalue problem → solution v(t); solution v(t) → v(t) still an eigenvector of A"
