  "Problem": "Consider a function space in which solutions to the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 f = 0 \\\\) are investigated, and let \\\\( g(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 \\\\) be a transformation applied to any function \\\\( f \\\\) in this space. Examine the impacts of applying another transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(f) = f + \\\\lambda xy \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a given point an intervention by another transformation \\\\( k(f) = f - \\\\lambda xy \\\\) is applied to the function resulting from \\\\( h(f) \\\\), will the outcome still represent a harmonic function for any arbitrary \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(f) \\\\) effectively negates the added non-harmonic term \\\\( \\\\lambda xy \\\\) introduced by \\\\( h(f) \\\\). Therefore, the original harmonic property of \\\\( f_0 \\\\) is restored, making it satisfy the Laplace equation again, regardless of the specific value of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
