  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a function's domain and range are controlled by differential equations \\\\(dx/dt = Px\\\\) and \\\\(dy/dt = Qy\\\\), where P and Q are constant matrices. We investigate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T[x(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Rs}x(s) ds\\\\) on x(t), where R is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T[x(t)]\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(x_0(t)\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(dx/dt = Px\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(x_0(t)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(dx/dt = Px\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T[x(t)]\\\\) initially alters the state of the system by integrating the function multiplied by the exponential matrix \\\\(e^{Rs}\\\\). This integration changes the initial condition from that of simply evolving under \\\\(dx/dt = Px\\\\), resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
