  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(du/dt = Au\\\\) and \\\\(dv/dt = Bv\\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) is applied, where C is a constant scalar.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions used is infeasible solely based on the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), because different combinations of transformations and parameters (C and D) could result in the same final state due to the properties of exponential functions and their potential to compensate or exacerbate each other's effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
