  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(\\lambda+i\\omega)t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) are real constants representing growth and oscillation parameters respectively. We will explore the impacts of applying a Laplace transform to this function and its inverse.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) resulting in \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), then we consider the impact over time without any other operation, does recovering \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) via inverse Laplace transform provide the function in its original form?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are designed to be inverses of each other, assuming all conditions for existence are met. Thus, applying the Laplace transform and then the inverse Laplace transform to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) should return the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
