  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. Examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + ke^{Mt} \\\\), where k is a constant vector and M is a constant matrix, on the solution u(t) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition, altering the trajectory of the solution. The additional term \\\\( ke^{Mt} \\\\) introduces a different growth dynamic influenced by M, leading to a solution at time T that differs from that obtained by merely evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
