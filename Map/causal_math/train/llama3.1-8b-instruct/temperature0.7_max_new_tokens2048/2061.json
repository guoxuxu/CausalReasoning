  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of replacing a matrix A in a linear system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) with a new matrix \\\\(A' = A + B\\\\), where B introduces a perturbation. Let the initial condition be \\\\(x_0\\\\) and consider the effect of operator \\\\(f(x) = e^{Bt}x\\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) without additional perturbations, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if only the original system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) acted on \\\\(x_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\(e^{Bt}x_0\\), and its subsequent evolution under system \\\\(Ax\\\\) divergence from that of an unperturbed system To discern the dynamics, \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{At}\\\\) handle contributions differently, thus differing from an untransformed evolution at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
