  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant angular frequency and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) applied to this function.\n\nGiven the function \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\), can the original function \\( z_0 \\) and frequency \\( \\omega \\) be uniquely determined without knowing whether the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The nature of \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\) is such that both the magnitude and phase vary with \\( \\omega \\) in a deterministic manner. Therefore, from \\( z(T) \\), both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( z_0 \\) can be uniquely retrieved regardless of the application of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
