  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit system modeled by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where Z represents impedance as a function of the complex variable s. We are analyzing the impact of a Laplace transform on an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( X(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of the time-domain signal.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we precisely trace back to the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) knowing only the impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), without knowing if the transformation through \\\\( X(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the explicit inverse process or knowledge about the initial transformation of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through \\\\( X(s) \\\\), it is infeasible to retrieve \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solely based on \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The transformation might alter properties critical for exact retrieval in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
