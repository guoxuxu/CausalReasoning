  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a system's state over time. The Laplace Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the effect of applying an input function \\\\( u(t) = e^{st} \\\\) to this system, particularly considering how intervention could impact temporal dynamics.\n\nIf the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied to the system at t = 0 and the system evolves under its natural dynamics without additional intervention, will the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a later time t = T reflect only the natural dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( u(t) = e^{st} \\\\) as an initial condition modifies the system's response, potentially altering the terms in \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The Laplace Transform of the resulting function will contain contributions from both the natural dynamics and the initial conditions set by \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
