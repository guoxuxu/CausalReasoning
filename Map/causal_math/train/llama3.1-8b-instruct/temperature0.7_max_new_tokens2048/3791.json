  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a complex constant, and its application in an integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We investigate how changes in the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) influence the transformation output.\n\nIf an intervention alters the complex constant \\\\( c \\\\) to a new value \\\\( c' \\\\) at a midpoint during the transformation process, will the final value of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be influenced exclusively by the new \\\\( c' \\\\) and not the original \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( c \\\\) to \\\\( c' \\\\) at a midpoint introduces a discontinuity in the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The final output \\\\( F(s) \\\\) becomes a combination integral involving both phases of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( c' \\\\), resulting in an output influenced by both values rather than exclusively by \\\\( c' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
