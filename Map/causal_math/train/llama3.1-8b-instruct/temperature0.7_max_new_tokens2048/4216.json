  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = C e^{At} \\\\), where A is a skew-symmetric matrix and C is a constant matrix. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transform given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact form of any added perturbation matrix \\\\( D \\\\) just by comparing the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and the new \\\\( F'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although changes in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) indicate alterations in the system's dynamics, pinpointing the exact nature or form of \\\\( D \\\\) merely from these transformations might not be feasible due to potential non-uniqueness in the matrix logarithm and lack of additional context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
