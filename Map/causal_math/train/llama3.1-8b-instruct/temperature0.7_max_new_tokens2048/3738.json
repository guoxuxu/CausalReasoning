  "Problem": "Consider a system dynamics where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle in a one-dimensional space is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t) + F(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) a positive constant representing damping and \\\\( F(t) \\\\) an external force function. The study involves the introduction of a sudden force impulse \\\\( F(t) = I \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\), where \\\\( I \\\\) is the impulse magnitude and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nCan the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) be unequivocally determined by observing the position at some \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\) without knowing the impulse was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the impulse, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the original position since the additional component introduced by \\\\( I \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\) affects the trajectory in a way that cannot be accounted for from merely observing the later state.",
