  "Problem": "Consider a setup where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time in accordance to two linear systems \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Qy \\\\), with P and Q being constant matrices. The impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\), where R is another constant matrix, is examined.\n\nKnowing only the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely which transformations were applied during the evolution, whether just \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), multiple scenarios could lead to the same endpoint due to the properties of matrix exponentials and their non-unique effects on the system’s trajectory, particularly when S, R, P, and Q are involved. Thus, identifying the exact transformations used is not feasible without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
