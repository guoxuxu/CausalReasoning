  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) and let \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform over the spatial variables, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t) \\), on the solution's behavior.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system by adding a function \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), such that the new initial condition at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is \\\\( u(x,t_1) + v(x,t_1) \\\\), and then the system evolves, will the heat equation's dynamics from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T depend solely on \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the initial condition and thus affects the system's subsequent evolution. The introduced function \\\\( v \\\\) adjusts the state variables, leading the future states to depend on both the original and the intervened conditions. Therefore, dynamics from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T will reflect inputs from both \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
