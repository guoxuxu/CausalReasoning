  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At} x \\), where \\( x \\) is a complex vector and \\( A \\) is a complex square matrix. Evaluate the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another complex matrix, on this function over a period \\( T \\).\n\nIf \\( I(z) \\) is computed after \\( z(t) \\) has evolved up to time \\( T \\) without any other operations, does the result solely depend on the initial vector \\( x \\) and the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\( I(z) \\) under these circumstances is directly influenced by \\( x \\), \\( A \\), and \\( B \\) through the integration and matrix exponentials. The linearity and continuity of the integral and exponential operators ensure that the influence of \\( x \\), \\( A \\), and \\( B \\) is straightforwardly propagated through \\( z(t) \\) to \\( I(z) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
