  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\) is the wave function and H is the Hamiltonian operator. We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iK} \\\\psi \\\\), with K being a constant operator, is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) requires knowledge about the transformation applied due to the potential phase shift introduced by \\\\( e^{iK} \\\\). Without this information, multiple initial states (differing by a phase factor) could feasibly evolve to the same final state, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
