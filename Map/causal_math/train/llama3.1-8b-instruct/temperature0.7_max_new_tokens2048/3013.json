  "Problem": "Consider a time-varying complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We look at the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and then the result is analyzed without further transformation, will \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equal to a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) directly results in a delta function concentrated at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This is due to the property of the Fourier transform in transforming pure exponential functions into delta functions, reflecting the frequency of the oscillation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
