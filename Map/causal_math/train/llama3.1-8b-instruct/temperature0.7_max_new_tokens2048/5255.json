  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the behavior of the transformed function under a translation operation in the time domain, i.e., \\\\( g(t) = f(t-a) \\\\) with a positive a, represented by \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation, represented by multiplying the original transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( e^{-bs} \\\\), is introduced after the initial shift, will the new transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) represent the Laplace transform of the function resulting from both transformations applied consecutively?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the additional transformation by multiplying the already shifted transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) equals \\\\( e^{-bs} e^{-as}F(s) = e^{-(a+b)s}F(s) \\\\). This correctly represents the Laplace transform of the function initially shifted by \\\\( a \\\\) then further by \\\\( b \\\\), confirming that consecutive shifts add together in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "translation → shift in time domain; shift in time domain → multiplication by e^(-as); multiplication by e^(-bs) → multiplication by e^(-bs); F(s) → G(s); G(s) → H(s)"
