  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the system's state at time t. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform, designated as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), a complex function in the s-domain.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) is taken at t = 0 and then put under analysis to deduce properties in the time domain, does the analysis directly affect the subsequent time evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The process of taking the Laplace transform is a mathematical operation that, by itself, does not alter the real system's dynamics described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T remains dependent solely on the original system's equations and initial conditions, separate from the analysis conducted in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform of z(t) at t = 0 → analysis of L{z(t)}; analysis of L{z(t)} → properties in the time domain; analysis of L{z(t)} → z(t) from t = 0 to t = T"
