  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), which is a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Assume \\\\( z(t) \\\\) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Let an intervention be defined as a multiplication by matrix \\\\( P \\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the transformed function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without any knowledge of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The calculation of the Laplace transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) involves an integration which loses some information about the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without additional constraints or knowledge about the structure of M, recovering \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is not guaranteed to be unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
