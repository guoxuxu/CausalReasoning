  "Problem": "Assume the eigenvalues of a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) are being tracked over time within the context of the characteristic polynomial \\\\( p_A(t) = \\\\text{det}(A - tI) \\\\). We consider the intervention of a matrix function \\\\( f(t, A) = A + tB \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix that commutes with \\\\( A \\\\).\n\nGiven the characteristic polynomial \\\\( p_A(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used, whether \\\\( f(t, A) \\\\), \\\\( g(t, A) \\\\), or both, solely based on the polynomial?",
  "Explanation": "The similar effects of matrix interactions and eigenvalue modifications by exponential components in both interventions \\\\( f(t, A) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t, A) \\\\) yield a non-unique set of characteristic outcomes. Therefore, it's impossible to precisely trace back and single out the interventions used based only on the polynomial at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Polynomial p_A(T) → T; B → f(t, A); f(t, A) → A + tB; p_A(T) → g(t, A) if p_A(T) ≠ p_A; g(t, A) → A; A → p_A; B → p_A if B ≠ 0"
