  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) only depend on the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the initial amplitude \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is \\\\( Z(s) = x\\frac{1}{s-i\\omega} \\\\), which clearly shows the dependency on both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The amplitude \\\\( x \\\\) scales the transformed function, indicating its effect on the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
