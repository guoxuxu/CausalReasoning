  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\), can we decipher whether only a Fourier transform, only a Laplace transform, or both were applied during the evolution, solely based on observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the Fourier and Laplace transforms modify the system's representation in different but complementary domains (frequency and complex frequency), making it challenging to distinguish separately their effects based solely on the outcome at time T. Multiple paths through these transformations could yield similar end states, complicating causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
