  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, describing an oscillator in the complex plane. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, applied at different times.\n\nBased on observing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied solely from the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible without additional data about initial conditions or values of constants like \\\\( a \\\\). The effects of the transformation and the original oscillator equation's dynamics can yield similar endpoint characteristics under different initial scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
