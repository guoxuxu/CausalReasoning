  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relations in a linear system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We then consider the impact of invoking transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) on vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and on the time evolution described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf we observe the output state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), can we determine precisely if transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) was applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the output state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be reached through various initial conditions which could result either from different \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or modifications caused by applications of different transformations \\\\( B \\\\), it is impossible to precisely determine the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) based solely on the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\). Multiple possibilities exist, illustrating the scenario's non-deterministic nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
