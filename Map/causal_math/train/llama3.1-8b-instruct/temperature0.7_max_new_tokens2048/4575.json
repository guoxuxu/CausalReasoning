  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the state of the system and c is a constant wave speed. Consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the interval [0,T], an intervention changing c to a different constant wave speed \\\\( c' \\\\) is applied, will the state of the system \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on the original wave speed c?",
  "Explanation": "The new wave speed \\\\( c' \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward alters the propagation characteristics of the system, and hence the state at T would be dependent on both c and \\\\( c' \\\\), indicating a dependency on both the initial conditions manipulated by \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and modified propagation characteristics due to the change in wave speed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
