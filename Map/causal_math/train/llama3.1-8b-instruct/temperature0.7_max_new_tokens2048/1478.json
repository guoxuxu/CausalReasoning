  "Problem": "Consider a function $u(x, t)$ that satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) $\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu$, where $L$ is a linear differential operator. This scenario examines the effect of an integral transformation $T(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(x,t) \\\\, dt$, which corresponds to the Laplace transform with respect to time $t$.\n\nGiven $T(u)$ at a specific $s$, can one uniquely recover $u(x,0)$, the initial condition of the PDE, without additional boundary or initial value information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides information concerning the entire function over time $t$ rather than at a specific instant. Without the inversion of the transform or specific conditions throughout the domain such as boundary values or full knowledge of $u$ for all $t$, the initial state cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
