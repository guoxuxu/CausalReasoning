  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex domain. We assess the effect of applying a Laplace Transform, indicated by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to a transformed function \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and validate that \\\\( f(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without prior knowledge of whether a transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the properties of the Laplace Transform output match those expected from \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) (i.e., having poles at specific locations in the s-plane), it indicates the original function. The uniqueness properties of the Laplace Transform in terms of convergence ensure this inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Laplace Transform → Function g(t) is defined; g(t) = f(t) → Function f(t) is defined; Applying Laplace Transform → Laplace Transform of g(t) at time T; Laplace Transform of g(t) at time T → Time T; g(t) = e^{it} → f(t) = e^{it}"
