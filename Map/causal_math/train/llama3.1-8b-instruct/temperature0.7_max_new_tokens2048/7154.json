  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at a particular frequency range, can we ascertain the exact initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) used in the differential equation without knowing the specific value of \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the constant \\\\( A \\\\) in the differential equation, reconstructing the precise initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from the Fourier transformed function is ambiguous. The constant \\\\( A \\\\) affects the growth rate and frequency modulation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), both crucial for accurately determining \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from the frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
