  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be accurately determined what interventions were used (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) solely from the final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different sequences or types of transformations due to the intertwining effects of squaring (increasing magnitude and affecting phase) and shifting (translating the trajectory). These interactions make it challenging to distinguish between and backtrack the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
