  "Problem": "Examine a complex function's behavior under transformation with the Laplace Transform, where the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). Consider the transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nCan we accurately determine the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) only from its Laplace transform \\\\( f(s) \\\\) without additional information about the transformation process?",
  "Explanation": "If the Laplace transform of a function is known, the original function can typically be accurately determined by applying the inverse Laplace transform, under standard assumptions such as causality, linearity, and region of convergence considerations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
