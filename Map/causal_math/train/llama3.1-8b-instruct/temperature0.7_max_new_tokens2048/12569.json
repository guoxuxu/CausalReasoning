  "Problem": "Imagine a system of differential equations given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = Kz(t)\\\\), where K is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}z(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the transformed state \\\\( h(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely infer the original initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) based solely on the knowledge of K?",
  "Explanation": "The initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be unambiguously inferred from \\\\( h(z(T)) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of the integral transformation and the matrix M because the transformation integrates the system's behavior over time, potentially obscuring or altering information about the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
