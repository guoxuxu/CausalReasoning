  "Problem": "Consider a quantum system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system. We examine changes due to the operation of the unitary transformation \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iH't} \\\\), where \\\\( H' \\\\) is another Hamiltonian.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping mathematical effects of the unitary operations, which depend on potentially non-commuting Hamiltonians \\\\( H, H', \\\\) and K, make it impossible to uniquely backtrack from \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) to determine specific interventions used. Multiple combinations of \\\\( U(t) \\\\) and \\\\( V(t) \\\\), with different timing and Hamiltonians, could lead to the same or indistinguishably close final states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
