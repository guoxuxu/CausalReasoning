  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), which maps a function in the time domain to a function in the complex frequency domain. Investigate the effect of modifying this transformation by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), where a is a real number.\n\nGiven the modified transform \\\\( F(s)e^{-as} \\\\), can we unambiguously determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\), the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved as the shifting effect in the time domain is unknown. Any of a range of functions shifted by different amounts could yield the same modified transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
