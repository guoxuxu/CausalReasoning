  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system's state over time t. An integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) characterized by the kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\) is applied, influencing the evolution according to the formula \\\\(Tz(t) = \\\\int K(s, t) z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(Tz(T)\\\\), is it possible to discern precisely which transformations (either \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(U\\\\), or both) were applied throughout the evolution, based solely on the end state and without historical transformation data?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(Tz(T)\\\\) can potentially result from various combinations or sequences of transformations, rendering it infeasible to exactly pinpoint the specific transformations used without additional data on the history and nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
