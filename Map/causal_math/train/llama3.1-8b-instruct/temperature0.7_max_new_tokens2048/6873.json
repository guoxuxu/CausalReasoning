  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and K is a complex constant matrix. Let the transformation function be \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial conditions by modifying the trajectory via the transformation \\\\( e^{At} \\\\). This change in initial conditions, especially due to the nontrivial component A, affects the solution path, leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
