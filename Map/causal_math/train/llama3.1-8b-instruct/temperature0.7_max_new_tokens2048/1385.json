  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)](s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) + i\\\\mathcal{L}[v(t)](s) \\\\). We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = az + b \\\\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) before taking its Laplace Transform, does the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) change compared to directly computing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t) \\\\)] and then applying the transformation in the s-domain (applying equivalent transformation on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before the Laplace transform changes the function to which we apply the transform, yielding \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[az(t) + b](s) \\\\). This is different from computing \\\\( aZ(s) + b/s \\\\) if directly transforming after. The operations in the time domain and frequency domain do not commute.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
