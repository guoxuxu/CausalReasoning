  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p(t)y = \\\\int_0^t k(s) y(s) ds \\\\), where p(t) and k(t) are given functions of time. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), with a transform function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} y(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) post-intervention, can we determine precisely what the intervention was (re-calculation of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), application form, etc.) solely by the knowledge of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output at \\\\( T > 0 \\\\), even post an intervention, is a cumulative effect of both the original and the modified dynamics imbued by the integro-differential equation. Given the complex interaction between the integral terms and the dynamic terms \\\\( p(t) \\\\), it becomes infeasible to uniquely determine the nature or even the occurrence of the intervention solely based on \\\\( y(T) \\\\), due to the multiplicity of potential paths and interventions that could have led to the same outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
