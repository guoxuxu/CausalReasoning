  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( z(t) \\) is a complex function and \\( s \\) is a complex parameter. Analyze the Laplace transform's effect on \\( z(t) \\) modified at \\( t = 0 \\) by \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) and impacted by \\( h(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nIf at time \\( t = 0 \\) \\( g(z) \\) is applied, and then at \\( t = t_1 \\), \\( h(t) \\) intervenes, will the final Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\), \\( f(z) \\), be solely determined by \\( g(z) \\) and not \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) influence \\( z(t) \\). The squaring of the initial condition and the exponential function \\( e^{at} \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\) alter \\( z(t) \\)'s nature both initially and progressively. The Laplace transform \\( f(z) \\), being an integral transform, encapsulates these cumulative changes, and hence depends on both \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(t) \\).",
