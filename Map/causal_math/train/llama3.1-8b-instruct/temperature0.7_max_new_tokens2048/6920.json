  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined in the complex plane, which represents a rotation as a function of time. Analyze how the Laplace Transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\)) of this function, given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}e^{it} \\\\, dt \\), affects the original function's behavior under various conditions.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed result, can we isolate and identify the influence of the specific intervention \\\\( f(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), separate from the original function's impact?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integral and exponential nature of the Laplace Transform, differentiating the effects of the original function and the intervention from just the transformed result is complex. This complexity arises as transformations typically encode combined effects into a single expression without clear ways to separate these contributions post-transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
