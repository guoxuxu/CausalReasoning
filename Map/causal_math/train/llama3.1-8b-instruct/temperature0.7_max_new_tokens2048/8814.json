  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) on a real signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(s) z(t-s) ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we precisely recover the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) (the transformation function) is not feasible. The convolution alters critical information about phasing and magnitude that cannot be uniquely deciphered without precise knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
