  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), applied to this function over variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is directly used in the Laplace transform without modification to \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s) \\\\) be equivalent to transforming a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\neq \\omega \\\\))? ",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the Laplace transform is highly sensitive to the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) in function \\\\( h \\\\) results in a different transform, specifically \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\omega} \\\\) and \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\omega'} \\\\), assuming \\\\( s \\) has a real part greater than \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega' \\\\), which are clearly distinct unless \\\\( \\omega = \\omega' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
