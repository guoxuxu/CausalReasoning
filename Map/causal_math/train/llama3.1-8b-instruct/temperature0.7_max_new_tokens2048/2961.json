  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the temperature distribution over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the influence of a spatial transformation given by \\\\(g(x) = ax+b\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants, on this temperature distribution.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) is applied to redefine the spatial coordinates at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the heat equation is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to the situation without applying \\\\(g\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) changes the spatial configuration of initial temperature distribution. This initial modification influences the heat flow and the distribution over time under the heat equation, leading to a different temperature profile at any later time \\\\(t = T\\\\) compared to if \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was not applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
