  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation given by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. We explore the effect of an integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) for time T, can we unequivocally determine the specific interventions applied (whether initial conditions or the introduction of \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Fourier transform at time T can arise from various initial conditions and possible interactions with added terms such as \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\). Different combinations of these factors can lead to the same Fourier transform, making it challenging to distinguish precisely which interventions were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
