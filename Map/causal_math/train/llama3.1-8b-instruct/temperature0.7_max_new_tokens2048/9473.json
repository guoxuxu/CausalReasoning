  "Problem": "Consider a model described by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function. An external influence is introduced by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which affects how the solution evolves. Specifically, the exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) scales the magnitude of \\\\( z \\\\), thus altering the trajectory from what it would be under the natural evolution according to \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
