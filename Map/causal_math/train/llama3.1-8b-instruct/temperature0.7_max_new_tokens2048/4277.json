  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor R and an inductor L in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(V(t)\\\\) denotes the applied voltage. We introduce a transformation \\\\(g(I) = I + ct\\\\), where c is a constant, applied to the current I at time t.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\(g(I)\\\\) to the current at t = 0, when \\\\(V(t) = V_0\\\\) a constant voltage, and allow the circuit to run without further intervention, will the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at time T differ from the untransformed system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(I)\\\\) modifies the initial current, altering the differential \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\) by adding the term ct to the current. This shifts the trajectory of the current solution, leading to a different current at any time T compared to the system where no transformation \\\\(g(I)\\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
