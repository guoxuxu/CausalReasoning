  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod varies with time and position, governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider an intervention represented by a heat source term \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) introduced at a position \\\\(x1\\\\) affecting the system.\n\nIf the heat source \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) is introduced at time \\\\(t1\\\\) affecting only a local region near \\\\(x1\\\\), will the final temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t1\\\\) be solely dependent on the properties and initial state of the system without considering the effects of \\\\(S\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the localized heat source \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) fundamentally alters the system dynamics at and around \\\\(x1\\\\) post \\\\(t1\\\\). This change will affect the entire system's temperature distribution over time due to the diffusion, making the end state dependent on both the system’s initial state and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
