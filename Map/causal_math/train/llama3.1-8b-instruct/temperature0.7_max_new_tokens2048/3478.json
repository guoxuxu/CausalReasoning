  "Problem": "Consider a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) that is governed by the Schrodinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). An integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = \\\\int h(x) \\\\psi(x,t) dx \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a fixed function.\n\nCan the original wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) be exactly deduced at t = 0 after observing the transformed wave function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at any future time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) is an integral that may involve loss of information (not necessarily invertible), and the wave function evolves according to the Schrodinger equation, it is generally not possible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) from \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at a later time t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
