  "Problem": "We examine a signal transformation using the Laplace transform in an electrical circuit. The input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is studied in the Laplace domain by applying \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), respectively.\n\nIf an additional filtering process characterized by \\\\( F(s) = e^{-sT} \\\\) where \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) is applied to the system at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will this intervention affect \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) independently of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) for all \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the introduced filtering is not independent of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The new system behavior would be described by \\\\( Y'(s) = H(s)F(s)X(s) \\\\), clearly intertwining the effects of the original system's impulse response with the filter. The resulting output depends on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
