  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and x is a constant vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We explore how different transformations influence the behavior of function z over time using the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to simplify the analysis.\n\nAfter observing the output of z at time T, can we distinctly identify if any transformations (either \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, considering we only know the structure of z and the timing of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The ability to identify specific interventions based solely on the output at time T is hindered by the nature of exponential matrix transformations, which may yield the same endpoint from different initial or intermediate states. The overlapping effects of matrices B and C make it impossible to ascertain the exact nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
