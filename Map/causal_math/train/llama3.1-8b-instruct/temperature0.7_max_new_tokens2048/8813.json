  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) on a real signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(s) z(t-s) ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nWill the convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) result in a signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) that retains the original frequency components of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any alteration?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\), which introduces modulation by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) and scaling by \\\\( t \\\\), fundamentally alters the frequency components of the signal. The result is a frequency-shifted version of the original signal combined with additional components due to multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
