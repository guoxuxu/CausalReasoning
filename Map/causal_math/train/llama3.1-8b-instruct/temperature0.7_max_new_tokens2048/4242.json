  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant scalar and \\\\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. We study the effect of the Laplace transform on this function over time interval \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function, can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) only determines the pole at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\), but without additional information about the imaginary part of \\\\( s \\), \\\\( \\omega \\\\) cannot be uniquely resolved due to ambiguities in possible frequencies reflecting the same transform behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
