  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) in the complex plane where \\( A \\) is a non-scalar constant matrix. Examine the evolution of the function under different mappings and their compositional effects.\n\nGiven the output \\( w \\) from \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), can we uniquely deduce \\( z \\) knowing that a linear transformation \\( T \\) might have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\( w = e^{Az} \\) or \\( w = e^{ABz} \\) (where \\( B \\) is unknown), the lack of information about \\( B \\) and the non-invertible nature of exponential functions in complex matrices hinder establishing a unique \\( z \\). The ambiguity due to matrix commutativity also adds complexity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
