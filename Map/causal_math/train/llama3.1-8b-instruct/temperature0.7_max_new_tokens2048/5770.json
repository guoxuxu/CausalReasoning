  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being scalar constants. The system is analyzed using a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another scalar constant.\n\nIs it possible to determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, if the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), or \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) at the beginning, the analysis of the progression from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) would lack critical information about the phase and amplitude adjustment made by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), leading to potential multiple original states that could have evolved to the same endpoint under different scenarios.",
