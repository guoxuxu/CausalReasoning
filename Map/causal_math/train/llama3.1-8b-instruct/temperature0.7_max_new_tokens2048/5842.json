  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution condition.\n\nFrom observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively infer the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) if it was transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) without knowing it?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) changes the base frequency spectrum of the distribution, and these changes evolve in time due to the heat equation. Without knowledge of the use of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), one cannot accurately back-calculate the precise original distribution from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
