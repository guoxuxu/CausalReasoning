  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{kz} \\\\), where k is a complex constant. We examine the implications of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-iwz} dz \\\\), where w is a real constant representing frequency.\n\nDoes the transformation \\\\( H(w) \\\\) perfectly recover the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) from its transformed form when applied without any alterations or interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( H(w) \\\\) is akin to the Fourier transform of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). For certain values of k, especially when k is not purely imaginary, the exponential \\\\( e^{kz} \\\\) does not satisfy the conditions necessitated for the Fourier inversion theorem to apply directly; it might not decay fast enough or oscillate adequately to allow a perfect reconstruction via the inverse Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
