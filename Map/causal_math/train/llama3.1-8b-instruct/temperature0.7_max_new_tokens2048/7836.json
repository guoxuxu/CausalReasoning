  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\) is mapped using \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. We investigate the function under two scenarios: one driven by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\) with B being another complex constant, and another by a transformation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a third complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the interventions that were applied, specifically if both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or either was involved, using only the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex due to the overlapping effects and possible non-commutative properties of the complex exponential functions involved. The same endpoint could result from varying applications and timings of the interventions, obscuring the causality trail.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
