  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of the Laplace transform on this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to its definition without any intervention, will the Laplace transform at any complex value \\\\( s \\\\) remain \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), assuming \\\\( \\mathrm{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\). Without any intervention, this functional relationship holds at any point in the evolution since the transform is derived directly from the function's time evolution without modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
