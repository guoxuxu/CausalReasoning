  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant parameter. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), particularly focusing on changes over time in the spectral domain defined by \\\\( k \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint in the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether Fourier transform, inverse transform, or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of possible interventions such as transformations or their inverses at any point during the evolution complicates uniquely tracing back to specific operations, especially since the effects of the heat equation alone are reversible in the spectral domain. Multiple transformation scenarios could lead to the same outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
