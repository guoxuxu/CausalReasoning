  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) defined in the complex plane and let \\\\(F(s)\\\\) denote the Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t)\\\\), where \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is a real-valued function that corresponds to the real part of \\\\(f(z)\\\\). We examine behaviors when \\\\(z\\\\) traverses along different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention changes the path of \\\\(z\\\\) at mid-point from linear to exponential toward the endpoint, will this modification in path influence the resulting \\\\(F(s)\\\\) in comparison to a purely linear path?",
  "Explanation": "Switching to an exponential path introduces a different nature of traversal in areas potentially rich in function properties like singularities or essential discontinuities, which can significantly impact the values of \\\\(f\\\\) along the path and therefore alter \\\\(F(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
