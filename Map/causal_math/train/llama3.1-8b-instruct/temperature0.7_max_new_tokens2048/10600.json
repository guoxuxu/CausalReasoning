  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}\\) where \\(f(t)\\) is a time-domain representation and \\(F(s)\\) is its frequency-domain representation. The effect of an impulse response function \\(h(t)\\) on \\(f(t)\\), transformed as \\(H(s)\\), is analyzed through its impact on \\(F(s)\\).\n\nCan the specific change in impulse response function (from \\( h(t) \\) to \\( j(t) \\)) be identified solely from observing the eventual \\( G(s) \\) without prior knowledge of both?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple differing impulse responses could result in the same or similar frequency responses when convolved with \\( f(t) \\). Without prior knowledge of \\( h(t) \\) or \\( j(t) \\), it's infeasible to definitively trace back and identify what specific changes were made.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(t) → H(s); f(t) → F(s); H(s) → F(s); h(t) → f(t); j(t) → J(s); J(s) → F(s); f(t) → G(s); G(s) → H(s) is not a direct causal link; h(t) → H(s) → F(s) and j(t) → J(s) → F(s) are distinct causal paths; therefore h(t) → F(s) and j(t) → F(s) are distinct; h(t) → f(t) and j(t) → f(t) are distinct; therefore the change in impulse response function from h(t) to j(t) can be identified from observing the eventual G(s) if f(t) is known"
