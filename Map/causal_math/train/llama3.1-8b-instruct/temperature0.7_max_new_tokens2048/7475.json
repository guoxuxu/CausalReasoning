  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\) with A and B being constant complex matrices. This scenario explores the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) under the linear transformations \\\\( T_x(x, y) = (x+1, y) \\\\) and \\\\( T_y(x, y) = (x, y+1) \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a change is made to the function to \\( f'(x, y) = e^{C(x+1) + D(y+1)} \\) where C and D are new matrices, will the resultant \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the original matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( f' \\) introduces new matrices C and D into the exponential factors, fundamentally altering the growth rate and pattern of \\( z \\). The state \\( z(T) \\) now depends on the new matrices C and D as well as the initial matrices A and B, and how these matrices interact through the variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
