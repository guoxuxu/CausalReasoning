  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), with a constant complex number \\\\( s \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{qt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) (where \\\\( q \\\\) is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( s \\\\) or \\\\( q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces another varying element, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\), in addition to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The new integral transformation can further modify the trajectory and endpoint of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affected by its own complex exponential factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
