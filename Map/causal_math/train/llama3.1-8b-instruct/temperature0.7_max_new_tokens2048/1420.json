  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of an integral transformation on a function's Fourier transform. Suppose we have a function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) and we apply the transformation \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\). Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) as applied on both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( T(g)(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the final function after applying both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), can you determine precisely which transformations were used, in which order, solely from the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform might reveal alterations suggesting the nature of transformations (integral, polynomial addition), but it does not convey the precise sequence or the specific characteristics of those transformations due to the overlapping effects in frequency domain representations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
