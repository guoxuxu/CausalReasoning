  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), where \\( t \\) is time. We evaluate the integration of this function transformed by a differential operator \\( D \\) such that \\( Dz = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}z \\), for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\) after applying both \\( D \\) for \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( E \\) for \\( m = 1 \\) at different times before \\( T \\), can we precisely determine which operations were applied at what times just by observing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\( z(T) \\) could result from various combinations and sequences of applying \\( D \\) and \\( E \\), especially since both operators for \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\) produce the first derivative but at different times. This makes it difficult to uniquely determine the history of operations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
