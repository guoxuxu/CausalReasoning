  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. The impact of the Laplace transform on this function is analyzed over a variable \\\\(s\\\\) in the complex domain.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to \\\\(f(z)\\\\) without any intervention, will the resulting transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\) be solely dependent on the structure of matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) directly results in \\\\(F(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}\\\\), where I is the identity matrix and the result only depends on A. Hence, the output is solely determined by the matrix A without any external interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
