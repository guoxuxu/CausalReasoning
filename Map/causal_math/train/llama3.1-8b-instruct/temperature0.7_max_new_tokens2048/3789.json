  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a complex constant, and its application in an integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We investigate how changes in the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) influence the transformation output.\n\nIf the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) in the transform is changed from \\\\( s_0 \\\\) to \\\\( s_1 \\\\) without any intervention, will the transformed output \\\\( F(s_1) \\\\) be the same as the output given initially by \\\\( F(s_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different values of \\\\( s \\\\) modify the factor \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) in the integral, which fundamentally affects the integration result due to the influence on convergence and the weighting of the complex exponential \\\\( z(t) = e^{ct} \\\\). Changing \\\\( s \\\\) alters the decay rate in the exponential, thus influencing the integration output differentially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
