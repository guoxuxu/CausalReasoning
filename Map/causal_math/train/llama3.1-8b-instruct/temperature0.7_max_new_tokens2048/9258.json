  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine the changes introduced by performing a Laplace transformation on \\( z(t) \\), denoted as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial state \\( z_0 \\) purely by observing \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\) without knowing if it was transformed before or after the evolution according to \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "It’s challenging to reverse-engineer \\( z_0 \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\) without knowing the timing of the transformation, due to the fact that transforming before or after the solution impacts how \\( s \\) and \\( \\omega \\) relate and interplay in the transformed function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
