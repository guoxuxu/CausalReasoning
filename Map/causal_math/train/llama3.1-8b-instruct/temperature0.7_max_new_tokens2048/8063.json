  "Problem": "In a quantum mechanical system, an operator \\\\( P(x) = -i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) is employed to measure the momentum of a particle in state \\\\( \\\\psi(x) \\\\). We consider how changes to the quantum state through different transformations influence measurements. One such transformation involves the function \\\\( F(\\\\psi) = e^{ikx} \\\\psi(x) \\\\), where k is a real number representing a shift in momentum.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( G(\\\\psi) = e^{-ik'x} \\\\psi(x) \\\\) is applied at time t1 as an intervention, will the momentum measurement of the state at time T > t1 depend only on the original operator \\\\( P(x) \\\\) and not on both transformations \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of both transformations \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\) introduces additional phase shifts that alter the momentum spectrum of the wave function. The net effect on the momentum measurements at time T will depend on both k and k', as these shifts can compound or negate each other depending on their values and the dynamics between t1 and T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
