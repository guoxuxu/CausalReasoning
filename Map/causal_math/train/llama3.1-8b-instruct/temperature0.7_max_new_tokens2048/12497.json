  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane. The function is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\), implying a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at some \\\\( z \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the pre-transformation complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is difficult to trace back to the original value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( h(z_0) = iz_0 \\\\) could potentially yield various results under \\\\( g \\\\), depending on the characteristics of \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
