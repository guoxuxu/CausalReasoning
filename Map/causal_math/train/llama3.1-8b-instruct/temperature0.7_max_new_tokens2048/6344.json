  "Problem": "Examine a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), affects the system's evaluation over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\), can we ascertain precisely whether the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), or both were used during the process just by examining \\\\(u(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) could potentially be achieved from different pathways involving either one or both transformations due to their different but overlapping influences in their respective domains. The potential to reach the same endpoint from different transformation processes precludes definite identification of the specifics of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
