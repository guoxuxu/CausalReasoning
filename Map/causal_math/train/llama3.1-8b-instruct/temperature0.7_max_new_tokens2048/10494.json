  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nCan we uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) if no additional information about applying the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) is given?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is bijective (invertible) under reasonable signal conditions, such as \\\\( z(t) \\\\) being piecewise continuous and satisfying certain integrability conditions. Therefore, even without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( D \\\\), the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
