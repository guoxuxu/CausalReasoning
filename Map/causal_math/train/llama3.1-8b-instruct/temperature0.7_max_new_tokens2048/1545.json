  "Problem": "Assume a linear system of equations represented in matrix form \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is an invertible matrix. Analyze scenarios applying the Laplace transform to the function \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), with \\\\( x_0 \\\\) being the initial conditions, over the time domain.\n\nBy applying the Laplace transform to the system \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and evolving under linear dynamics without further intervention, does the Laplace transform of the solution differ from if it was applied directly to the evolved state at a later time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{At}x_0)(s) = (sI - A)^{-1} x_0 \\\\) is independent of the specific instance of t when applied, thus transforming the initial state or the state at any later time T results in the same expression due to the properties of the exponential matrix function and linearity of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
