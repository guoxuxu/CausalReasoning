  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system where the rate of growth of a population \\\\( p \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\), representing unrestricted quadratic growth. We consider alterations to this model through a transformation function \\\\( h(p) = p e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant decay factor.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(p) \\\\) is applied to the initial population \\\\( p_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to grow according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\) without further intervention, will the population \\\\( p(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( p_0 \\\\) had been directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(p) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial population to \\\\( p_0 e^{-kt} \\\\), which affects the growth trajectory significantly. The decay factor \\\\( k \\\\) causes an exponential decrease in the initial population, altering the quadratic growth process and leading to different population values at any subsequent time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
