  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az + B\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and the system is left to evolve under \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\(t = T\\\\) using the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation alters \\\\(z_0\\\\) by applying \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). The resulting trajectory will consequently evolve from this new initial state, resulting in a final state of \\\\(Az(T) + B\\\\) rather than just \\\\(C e^{i\\\\omega T}\\\\), which would have been the result without the transformation. The constants \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) introduce shifts and scaling that alter the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
