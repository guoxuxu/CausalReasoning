  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u + iv \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + cz^2 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are constants. We explore the behavior when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), and then the function is allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > t be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the differential equation alone?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a decaying exponential which modifies its original path. The alteration of the integral path changes the conditions under which the differential equation operates, thus affecting the function at any subsequent time T.",
