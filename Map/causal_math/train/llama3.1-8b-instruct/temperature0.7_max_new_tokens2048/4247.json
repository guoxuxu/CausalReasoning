  "Problem": "Imagine a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. Consider the application of a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex constant, to investigate integral transformations and their effects.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( R \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied, will the system's response at some later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be influenced only by the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) and not by \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the system, making the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on \\\\( Q \\\\), \\\\( R \\\\), and \\\\( P \\\\). The interplay of these transformations can significantly alter the path and endpoint of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
