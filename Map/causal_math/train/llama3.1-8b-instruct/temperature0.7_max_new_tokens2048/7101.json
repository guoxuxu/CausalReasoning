  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time t under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( Lz = z' + az \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z' \\\\) denotes the derivative of \\\\( z \\\\) with respect to t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied.\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) alters the initial condition by integrating the past states with exponential weighting, leading to a different trajectory under the operator \\\\( L \\\\) than the trajectory from simple evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the convolution-like effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
