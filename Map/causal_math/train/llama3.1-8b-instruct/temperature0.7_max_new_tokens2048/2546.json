  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator L, which transforms functions based on the equation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} k(s) x(t-s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(s) \\\\) is a kernel function. An intervention is applied by modifying the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to a new function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at a certain point after the initial condition.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) be recovered uniquely from the output at t = T assuming no intervention was made if the kernel function k is known?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion of integral transformations generally depends on the properties of the kernel function k, such as its invertibility or the Tikhonov regularization conditions. Without knowing these properties, or if k does not satisfy the required conditions for unique inversion, \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) cannot necessarily be recovered uniquely from the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
