  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) applied to \\\\(u\\\\), defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the ultimately transformed state by both \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) at some \\\\(s\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\), can we discern if either just \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), just \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), or both transformations were applied, knowing the described dynamics under \\\\(L\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compounded transformations by both \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) render the original causal pathway ambiguous, as the effects of each transformation can overlap or mask each other, thereby confounding clear inference about which transformations were applied from the endpoint back to initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
