  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the effects of introducing function transformations and boundary perturbations on the solution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we accurately identify what changes were made to the boundary conditions or if any changes occurred, knowing only the solution profile at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) could originate from several potential modifications in boundary conditions or might even reflect the natural evolution of the system under untouched conditions. Without additional information, precise identification of boundary changes from the solution alone is unattainable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
