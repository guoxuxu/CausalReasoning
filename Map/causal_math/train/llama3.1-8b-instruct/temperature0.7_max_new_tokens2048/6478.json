  "Problem": "A vector field $V(z)$ in the complex plane behaves according to the equation $V(z) = z^n$ where $n$ is an integer. We examine the consequences of applying a transformation $f(z) = e^{i \\theta}z$ where $\\theta$ is a constant angle.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector $z_0$ after observing $V(z(t))$ at $t = T$ without knowing whether $f(z)$ was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether $f(z)$ was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine $z_0$ since any rotation by $f(z)$ could lead to the same end result $V(z(t))$ for different starting points $z_0$, due to the multiplicative nature of complex exponentiation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
