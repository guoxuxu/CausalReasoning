  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving via the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Qz \\\\), with Q being a complex constant. Analysis includes the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\), where P is also a complex constant, representing an operational transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then it evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Qz \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Qz \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially transforms the state by \\\\( e^{Pt} \\\\), changing the trajectory from that of the unaltered equation. The properties of the complex exponentials and their influence on phases and magnitudes will result in a distinct trajectory at time T, influenced by both P and Q.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
