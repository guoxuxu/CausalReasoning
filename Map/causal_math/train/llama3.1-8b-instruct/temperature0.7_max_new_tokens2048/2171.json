  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied to examine the system behavior.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{D\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is used as an intervention at a particular time t1 < T. Does the resulting state at t = T depend solely on the original dynamics A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new transformation \\\\( S(z) \\\\) introduces a compound effect, mixing with the potential previous transformation by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and fundamentally altering the trajectory. As such, the endpoint at t = T also depends on matrices C and D, alongside matrices A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
