  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant. We analyze the influence of performing an inverse Laplace transform under the scenario of differentiating the impulse response associated with H(s).\n\nIf an external function \\\\( \\\\gamma(t) \\\\) is applied as a convolution to the original impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) before differentiating, will the resultant function depend only on 'a'?",
  "Explanation": "When an external function \\\\( \\\\gamma(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( h(t) = e^{at}u(t) \\\\) before differentiation, the resultant form of the function changes based on the properties of \\\\( \\\\gamma(t) \\\\). Although 'a' remains a factor in shaping the response, \\\\( \\\\gamma(t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics, hence the final form isn’t governed solely by 'a'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
