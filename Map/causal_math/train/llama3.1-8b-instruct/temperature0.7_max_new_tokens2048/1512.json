  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H \\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is the Hamiltonian operator. We examine the effect of a unitary transformation \\\\(U(t) = e^{-i At}\\\\) on the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a Hermitian operator.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions occurred (whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), or both) solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions used based only on the end state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the non-commutative nature of the exponentials of different Hermitian operators. Multiple combinations of \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) can lead to the same or indistinguishably similar final states, confounding the identification of the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
