  "Problem": "Let's consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time in the complex plane. We investigate the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to definitively conclude whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Observing just the end value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not allow us to definitively trace back whether the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied because both \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{2it} \\\\) could potentially produce the same observed output for specific values of \\\\( T \\\\), such as multiples of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
