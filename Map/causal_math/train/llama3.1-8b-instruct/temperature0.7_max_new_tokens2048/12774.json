  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax + B} \\\\) with matrices A and B. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) to analyze its properties in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an additional linear transformation represented by matrix C is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) prior to the Fourier transformation, will the resulting transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) be independent of B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new matrix C creates additional interactions with matrices A and B when being transformed. The resultant Fourier transform will be affected not only by C but also by the original terms A and B, displaying combined effects in the frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → B; C → z(x); z(x) → Fourier transformation; Fourier transformation → \\hat{z}(\\omega); \\hat{z}(\\omega) → independence from B"
