  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which ensures that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analytic. Further, suppose a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied, producing \\\\( L[z(t)] = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) changes at t = 0 due to a multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\), can the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) developed from t = 0 to T still be considered only a scaled version of the original Laplace transform if no further system information is given?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\) alters the original function, which changes the rules of superposition and scaling inherent in the Laplace transform. Hence, the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) won't simply be a scaled version of the original; it incorporates the effects of \\\\( c \\\\) altering both amplitude and phase components separately.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
