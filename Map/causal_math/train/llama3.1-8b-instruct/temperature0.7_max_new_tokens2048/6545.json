  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator to produce an output \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nDoes modifying the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) directly affect the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) if the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) remains unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) alters the integrand in the transformation expression, directly impacting \\\\( y(t) \\\\). As long as the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) stays constant, any changes in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) translate to corresponding changes in \\\\( y(t) \\\\) due to the linearity of the integral operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
