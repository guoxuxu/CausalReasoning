  "Problem": "Assume we have a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The system is subject to different treatment functions, specifically \\\\( f(x) = Sx \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) = Tx \\\\), where S and T are constant matrices. Consider how the transformations affect the system's state vector over time.\n\nIs it possible to infer the initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from the observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) = Sx \\\\) was initially applied, deducing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is inherently uncertain. The application of S alters \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Sx_0 \\\\), leading to different evolution paths and outcomes at time T, making it difficult to trace back to the original without certainty of the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
