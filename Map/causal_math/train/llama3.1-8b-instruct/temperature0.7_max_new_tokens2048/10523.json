  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. This function models a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). Additionally, analyze the impact of a Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), and its implications on causality inferences.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Laplace transform calculated at any \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) exclusively reflect this new \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) and not the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) results in a new system function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function will reflect the new value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), indicated by the pole of the transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\), effectively overwriting the earlier behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
