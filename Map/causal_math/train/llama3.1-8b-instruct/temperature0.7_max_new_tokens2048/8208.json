  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) defined on a complex domain, and a transformation h(z) where \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\). We analyze the effect of applying this transformation to various complex numbers and observing the results over the domain.\n\nKnowing the outcome of f(z) after interventions by h(z) and g(z), is it possible to discern the sequence or the specific nature of interventions applied (whether h(z), g(z), or both) from the final output alone?",
  "Explanation": "Both h(z) and g(z) are complex operations that can result in changes to the input of f which are difficult to reverse engineer uniquely. The exponential function and squaring of complex numbers can lead to multiple possible pre-images, making it impossible to definitely ascertain the interventions used just from the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
