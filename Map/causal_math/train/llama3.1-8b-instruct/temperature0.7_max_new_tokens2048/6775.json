  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + q(x)y = \\\\lambda y \\\\), with boundary conditions \\\\( y(0) = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(1) = 0 \\\\). Here, \\\\( q(x) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how transformations \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) (where k is a constant multiplier) affect the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this system.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) is applied as an intervention to an eigenfunction \\\\( y_0(x) \\\\) of the system, and then the system is evolved under altered conditions \\\\( -\\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + (q(x) + h(x))y = \\\\lambda y \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a new function added to the potential, will the resultant function still be an eigenfunction of the original operator without \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to the potential changes the differential operator governing the system, thus altering the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Even if \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) retains linearity, the presence of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the original conditions, making it unlikely for the transformed function to solve the original Sturm-Liouville problem.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
