  "Problem": "Assume a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform on this function over the variable t.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a certain time t1 to change the frequency from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), upon taking the Laplace transform, does the resultant function at s still reflect only the initial frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Therefore, the new Laplace transform will reflect this new frequency yielding \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega'} \\\\). As a result, the transform will contain information about the modified frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not just the initial \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
