  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) is considered for modeling the effect of time-dependent rotations on this system.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately deduce whether transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, intervention \\\\( S(z) \\\\) was implemented at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), either, or both, solely based on the endpoint data?",
  "Explanation": "Due to overlapping effects of the transformations (rotations in this case) that could logically lead to the same endpoint depending on the values of \\\\( t \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), it is undeterminable from endpoint data alone the specific sequence or type of transformations applied. The potential for numerous equivalent pathways to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) complicates unique identification.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
