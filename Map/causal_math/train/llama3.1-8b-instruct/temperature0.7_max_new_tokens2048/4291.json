  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial conditions and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces an additional rotational factor, affecting the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Both the initial transformation with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) contribute to the final state through their respective impacts on the phase of the complex number, resulting in a dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), and the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
