  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where z is a complex number. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on the function over various scenarios.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed for a complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the Laplace transform \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(t) = e^{t^2} \\\\) without further intervention, does the Laplace transform at \\\\( s = z_0^2 \\\\) reflect the direct computation of \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{t^2} \\\\) does not generally equal \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\) evaluated at any particular point because the transformation involves an integral that aggregates effects exponentially across all t, significantly altering the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
