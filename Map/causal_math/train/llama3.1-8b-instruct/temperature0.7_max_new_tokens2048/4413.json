  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We investigate the role of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\(F(u)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\), applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed system's state \\\\(F(u)(k, t)\\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to simply transforming the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and allowing evolution under L will affect the system differently than directly transforming at a later time. The evolution of u under L and its interaction with different wavenumbers k, determined by the Fourier transform, will generally produce different outcomes when comparing these two processes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
