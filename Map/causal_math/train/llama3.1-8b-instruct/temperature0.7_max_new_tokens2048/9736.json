  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We investigate the behavior of this system when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the end result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we accurately determine whether or not an intervention occurred altering \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without prior knowledge of system parameters or history?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) alone does not provide sufficient information to conclude definitively about the presence or absence of interventions such as changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The accumulation of effects through integration and lack of direct visibility into the instantaneous state at any time such as \\\\( t_1 \\\\) prevents backtracking to infer interventions accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
