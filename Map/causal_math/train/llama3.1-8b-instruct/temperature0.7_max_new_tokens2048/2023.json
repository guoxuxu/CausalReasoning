  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed using \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to analyze its behavior over time.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory by further scaling the amplitude of \\\\( z \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). As a result, the final trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) (affecting the phase) and the combined effects of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) on the magnitude, not just solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
