  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) is defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix, impacts the system over a period of time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix, is applied at a time \\\\( t_2 > 0 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_2 depend only on the original function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "This kind of intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the system's evolution. It means that the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on how both transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) interact with the base function \\\\( h(x) \\\\). Each matrix exponential affects the overall trajectory, making the endpoint highly dependent on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
