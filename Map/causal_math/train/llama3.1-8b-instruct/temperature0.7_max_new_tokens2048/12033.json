  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by a Laplace transform of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), leading to \\\\( Z(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is the system's transfer function. We analyze the effect of applying a convolution transformation \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\) directly on the time-domain signal, where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) in the time domain under the transformation \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\), can we deduce the original input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the convolution was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Deducing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) directly from \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) without knowing the convolution was applied is problematic since the transformation alters the frequency components of the input. Not knowing about the convolution means any reconstruction of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) would likely misinterpret the effects of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) as inherent features of the original signal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
