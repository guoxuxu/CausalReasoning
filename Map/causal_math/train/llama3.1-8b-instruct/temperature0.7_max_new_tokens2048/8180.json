  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A+B)s}z(s) ds \\\\) on z over the time interval [0, T].\n\nGiven the final function \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations or interventions were applied (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might be achievable through various combinations of transformations \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(z) \\\\), influenced by different matrix settings (A, B, and C). The nonlinear and overlapping nature of the integral and matrix exponential effects makes it challenging, if not impossible, to uniquely backtrack and precisely determine the interventions from the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
