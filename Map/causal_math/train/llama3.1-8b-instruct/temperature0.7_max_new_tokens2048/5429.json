  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\( \\\\Delta T \\\\) in a body is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We examine the effect of an external heating process described by \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}\\\\Delta T_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature difference.\n\nIf the external heating process \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied initially and then the system is allowed to evolve under the natural cooling process without further intervention, will the temperature difference \\\\( \\\\Delta T(t) \\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to just cooling the body from \\\\( \\\\Delta T_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The external heating process modifies the initial state by increasing the temperature exponentially at the start, hence changing the trajectory of \\\\( \\\\Delta T(t) \\\\) over time. The effect of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) essentially re-scales the initial condition, resulting in a different temperature at time T compared to natural cooling only.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
