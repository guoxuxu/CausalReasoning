  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nIf \\(z(t) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\) is transformed at \\(t = 0\\) and then evolved under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) without any further intervention, will \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > 0\\) still mimic the dynamics of \\(z(t) = e^{Ct}z_0\\) in the original, untransformed system?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\) significantly changes the frequency components of the initial vector \\(z_0\\). When evolved under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), the altered frequency components will result in different dynamics, leading to a system state at \\(T\\) that differs fundamentally from \\(e^{Ct}z_0\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
