  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation system given by \\\\( y = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. We investigate the change in outcome when a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is applied to the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform output, can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the Laplace transform result?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects in the s-domain where the transform of a convolution is a product, it is not possible to uniquely determine which functions were convolved with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) based solely on the final Laplace transform result. Different combinations of convolving functions can lead to the same s-domain output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "input_function x(t) → Laplace transform output; convolution with h(t) → change in Laplace transform output; convolution with g(t) → change in Laplace transform output; a (constant) → h(t); h(t) → Laplace transform output; Laplace transform output → interventions (convolution with h(t), convolution with g(t))"
