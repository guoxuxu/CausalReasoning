  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit with an impedance represented by the function \\( Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s + c} \\) in the Laplace transform domain, where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants. The input to the circuit is a voltage \\( V(s) \\), and the output is current \\( I(s) \\). The response of the circuit is also influenced by an operational amplifier with a Laplace transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\), which can be switched into the circuit as an intervention.\n\nCan we deduce the exact input voltage \\( V(s) \\) from the observed output current \\( I(s) \\) without any additional information about whether an operational amplifier was engaged?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the operational amplifier \\( H(s) \\) was engaged, it's unclear if the output current was directly influenced by \\( V(s) \\) or also modified by \\( H(s) \\). Since \\( H(s) \\) affects the output and its presence could significantly alter the computed \\( V(s) \\), exact deduction isn't possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
