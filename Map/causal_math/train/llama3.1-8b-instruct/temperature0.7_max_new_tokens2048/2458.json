  "Problem": "Consider a closed system involving a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a pole. The input signal is \\\\( x(t) = e^{st} \\\\). We study the system's behavior under Laplace transforms and analyze the effects of introducing an interrupting signal \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the step function.\n\nCan the specific original \\\\( s \\\\) value of the input \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) be uniquely concluded after witnessing the output in the absence of any alteration or additional detail about the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without the exact response or additional auxiliary conditions, multiple inputs could theoretically lead to similar outputs due to the complex behavior in the Laplace domain. The lack of intervention details and inherent properties of Laplace transformations create ambiguities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
