  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) describing heat distribution along a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) with constant diffusivity k. Investigate the implications of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x, t)e^{-i\\\\omega x}dx \\\\) applied to this model.\n\nCan the specific intervention \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) be determined from the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), given knowledge of the heat distribution at T and the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Deciphering \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) alone is impossible because different interventions might produce similar transformations of heat distributions at time T. The overlap in possible spectral effects from various filters obfuscates direct inference of specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
