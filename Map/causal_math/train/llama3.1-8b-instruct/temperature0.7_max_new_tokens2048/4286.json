  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of the Laplace transform on this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nAfter obtaining the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), can we uniquely identify the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is uniquely determined by the pole of the Laplace transform at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\), which indicates the specific frequency used in the original function. No additional information is required to deduce \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the transform outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
