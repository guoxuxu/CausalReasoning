  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a periodic input signal \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the signal frequency. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + a y = bx \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n\nAfter observing a change in the output response \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine whether this change was due to an alteration in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), 'a', or 'b', or any combination of these, just by analyzing the output signal?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple factors including changes in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), 'a', and 'b' can yield similar changes in the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Without additional information such as real-time intervention records or the ability to independently manipulate and test each variable, it's not possible to uniquely attribute the observed change in output to a specific cause or combination of causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
