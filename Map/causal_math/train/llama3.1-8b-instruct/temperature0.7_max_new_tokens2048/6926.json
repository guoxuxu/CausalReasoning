  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = c(t) + id(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven only the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we exactly recover the original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under reasonable conditions (e.g., \\\\( z(t) \\\\) being sufficiently smooth and decaying at infinity). Thus, knowing \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) allows recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
