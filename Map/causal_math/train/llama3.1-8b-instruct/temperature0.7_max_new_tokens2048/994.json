  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. We examine the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) to the system, where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time t, can we determine unequivocally whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and given \\\\( z(t) \\\\), we cannot definitively backtrack to ascertain whether the transformation was applied because the original condition has been exponentially modified in a way that merges naturally with the dynamics of \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
