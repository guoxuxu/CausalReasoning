  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is initially governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is introduced where C is a complex constant.\n\nConsidering the observed final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of interventions due to the general non-commutativity of complex exponential operations in the dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\). Multiple scenarios could lead to similar effects at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), rendering it infeasible to pinpoint the exact interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
