  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the behavior of the transformed function under a translation operation in the time domain, i.e., \\\\( g(t) = f(t-a) \\\\) with a positive a, represented by \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is shifted by \\\\( a \\\\) units in time to become \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and then transformed to Laplace space without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( e^{-as}F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation of a time-shifted function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\) units directly results in \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\). This is a standard property of the Laplace transform, demonstrating how a temporal translation affects the transform domain by a multiplicative exponential factor depending on the shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
