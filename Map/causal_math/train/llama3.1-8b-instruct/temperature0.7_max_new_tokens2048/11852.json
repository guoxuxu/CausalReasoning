  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governing complex oscillations, defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyzing the effect of a Laplace Transform applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the potential recovery of original conditions.\n\nGiven initial value \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), and applying a Laplace Transform on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from \\\\( t=0 \\\\), then letting it evolve under the given differential equation, is the transform at \\\\( t = T \\\\) the same as if calculated directly from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the original conditions without the Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform alters the nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by converting it from a time domain to a complex frequency domain, fundamentally changing the manner in which the function evolves according to the differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
