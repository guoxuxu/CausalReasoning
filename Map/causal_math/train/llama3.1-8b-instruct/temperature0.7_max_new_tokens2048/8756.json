  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We analyze how this function transforms the input \\\\( z \\\\) over iterative applications, particularly under the Mandelbrot set conditions.\n\nGiven an observed stable, finite endpoint after many iterations and an unknown intervention, can we conclude definitively that the original function without intervention would have otherwise diverged?",
  "Explanation": "Because the intervention could substantially influence the series' behavior, a stable, finite endpoint does not guarantee that the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without the intervention would have diverged. The intervention may have been critical in achieving the observed stability.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
