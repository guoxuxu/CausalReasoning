  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Suppose the transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after inverse transformation of \\\\( f(z) \\ applied on Z(s), can we certify the exact original Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without evidence about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) since the transformation introduces a modification that can't be resolved solely based on the modified signal \\( x(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
