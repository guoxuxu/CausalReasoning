  "Problem": "A system is governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + Az\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We explore the role of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is a different constant matrix influencing the trajectory over time t.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the matrices B and C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further introduces a distinct transformation, making the trajectory and final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) heavily dependent on B, C, and interactions with the nonlinear elements of the equation. The evolving dynamics hence rely on the compositions and particular characteristics of both B and C as well as the original matrix A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
