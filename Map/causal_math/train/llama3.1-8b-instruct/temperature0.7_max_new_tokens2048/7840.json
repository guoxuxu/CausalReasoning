  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant, and an integral transformation \\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\). We study how the transformation influences the properties of function \\( f \\) over complex domain.\n\nKnowing the result of \\( T[g \\circ f](s) \\) for a specific \\( s \\), can one determine whether \\( g \\) was applied to \\( f \\) before \\( T \\), or if \\( T \\) was applied directly to \\( f \\) without \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple functional forms of \\( f \\) and types of \\( g \\) can yield similar transformation outcomes under \\( T \\), it is generally non-trivial to backtrack uniquely to the application sequence. Moreover, the effects of \\( g \\) influencing \\( f \\) become entangled in the transformation results, leaving ambiguity without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
