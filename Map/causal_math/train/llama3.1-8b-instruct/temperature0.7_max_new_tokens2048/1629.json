  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Sx} \\\\) where S is a constant matrix, used to solve the complex function equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}z = Pz \\\\), with P as another constant matrix. The effect of transformations using additional operator \\\\( T(x) = e^{Qx} \\\\) over variable x, where Q is also a constant matrix, is studied.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}z = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( z(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to x = X under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}z = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(x) \\\\) changes the initial condition of the system. As \\\\( e^{Qx} \\\\) potentially modifies how the system evolves depending on the relation between P and Q, this can lead to a different system state at x = X.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
