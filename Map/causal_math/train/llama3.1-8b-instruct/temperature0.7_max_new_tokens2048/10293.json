  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s) u(s, t) ds \\\\) on the solution u(x, t), with K being a kernel function.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) undergoes the transform \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), will the form of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > 0 be equivalent to that obtained by evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under \\\\( Lu \\\\) without the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( T(u) \\\\) changes the initial condition effectively and alters how the solution evolves under the operator L. Depending on the properties of K and how it interacts with L, the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) may be significantly different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
