  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = c(t) + id(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) after convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we precisely determine both the interventions and the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the convolution results in a multiplication in the frequency domain, it generates ambiguities — multiple functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) could result in the same product, \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). This indeterminacy prevents uniquely identifying the interventions and the original signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
