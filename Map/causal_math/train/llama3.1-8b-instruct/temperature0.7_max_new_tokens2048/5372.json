  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the vector field is governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L \\{ v(t) \\} = sV(s) - v(0) \\), with \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\) where A is a constant matrix. We'll examine the effects of perturbing this system with another transform \\( f(v) = e^{Bt}v \\) where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( v(T) \\), can we precisely determine what interventions were applied (whether \\( f(v) \\), \\( g(v) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( v(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( v(T) \\) could potentially result from various combinations of applications of \\( f(v) \\) and \\( g(v) \\) due to the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials. The trajectory can converge to the same endpoint from different initial states and interventions, obscuring the exact nature of any transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
