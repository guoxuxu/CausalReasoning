  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of an inductor and a resistor in series, subjected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The mathematical model is governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and V(t) is a sinusoidal source voltage. To investigate the response, we apply a Laplace transform on the system.\n\nIf we introduce a time-dependent change in resistance \\\\(R(t)\\\\) as an intervention, will the transformed current \\\\(I(s)\\\\) solely depend on the original input voltage and not on the varying resistance?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a time-varying resistance changes the differential equation governing the circuit by adding a time-dependent term, affecting how the current responds. This means that \\\\(I(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain will be a function not only of the original \\\\(V(t)\\\\) but also of the changes in \\\\(R(t)\\\\), reflecting this additional complexity in the response.",
