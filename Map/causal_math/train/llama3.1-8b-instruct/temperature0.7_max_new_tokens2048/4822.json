  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where f(t) represents a time-dependent function and s is a complex number. An input signal f(t) is being studied for its transformation and response properties under different conditions and manipulations.\n\nBy observing the Laplace transform output \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information about modifications or conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific form of \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), it uniquely corresponds to \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) under standard Laplace transform assumptions. The characteristic form of the output makes it possible to directly deduce the form of the input signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
