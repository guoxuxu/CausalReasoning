  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the elliptic partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = -\\\\lambda u(x, y)\\\\) in a region \\\\(D\\\\). We explore how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which converts functions into their frequency components, influences our understanding of the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\).\n\nBased on the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_{new})\\\\) in the frequency domain, can we precisely identify both the original function \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) and the intervention \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\), knowing only \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying both the original function and the intervention uniquely from the frequency domain information is complex because the Fourier transform of the sum \\\\(u(x, y) + h(x, y)\\\\) creates a combined effect where individual components \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(h)\\\\) are superimposed. Without additional spatial domain information or constraints, this decomposition into original components is not uniquely resolvable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
