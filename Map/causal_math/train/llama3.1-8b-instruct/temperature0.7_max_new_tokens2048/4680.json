  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), a complex exponential where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real parameter representing frequency. We inspect the behavior of this function under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) over domain \\\\( x \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(X) \\\\) after an intervention, can the specific type of intervention (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both) be determined solely from observing \\\\( z(X) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature of interventions (scaling by \\\\( M \\\\), application of \\\\( T \\\\), or both) from the outcome \\\\( z(X) \\\\) is unclear. The transformations can produce overlapping effects, and without additional data about the parameters or the progression of the function across the domain, the source of change remains indiscernible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
