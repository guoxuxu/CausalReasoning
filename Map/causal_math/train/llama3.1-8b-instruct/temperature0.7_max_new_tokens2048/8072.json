  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) that maps real numbers x, y into the complex plane. The function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\), where A and B are fixed complex numbers. We are interested in examining the effects of applying a Laplace transform to x and a Fourier transform to y, and how these transformations influence the calculation of an integral over a defined region.\n\nGiven the value of the integral obtained after transformations and interventions, can we identify precisely whether changes in coefficients occurred, and what the values of A, B, A', and B' were?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting integral after applying the Laplace and Fourier transforms and then altering the coefficients partway can yield values that might correspond to several different scenarios of coefficient adjustments. The transformations obscure the direct linkage and commutation effects between coefficients, making exact identification of changes impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
