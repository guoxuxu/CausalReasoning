  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We examine how manipulating the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) through multiplication by \\\\( t^n \\\\) affects its transform and the inverse process.\n\nFrom the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether it was obtained from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( t^n f(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without extra context such as the order \\\\( n \\\\) or the original function, multiple forms of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) could correspond to the same \\\\( F(s) \\\\) due to the variations introduced by the multiplication by \\\\( t^n \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "multiplication by t^n → F(s) changes; f(t) → F(s); F(s) → uniqueness determination"
