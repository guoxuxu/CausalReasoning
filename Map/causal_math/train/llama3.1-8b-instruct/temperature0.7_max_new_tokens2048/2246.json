  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\) acting on a complex function \\( x(t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We examine the consequences of applying an Integral transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) over time t.\n\nAfter observing the transformed output \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\), can we deduce the original function \\( x_0(t) \\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\( z(t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The observed output \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) gives information about the modified state \\( z(t) \\) rather than directly about \\( x_0(t) \\). Without certainty whether \\( z(t) \\) was applied, the original function \\( x_0(t) \\) cannot be accurately deduced due to the frequency shift introduced by \\( z(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
