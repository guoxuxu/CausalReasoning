  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex variable function described by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{st}z^s ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real numbers, in an integral transformation context.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), altering \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Ct}z \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant, will the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), depend only on the original function without considering the alteration made by \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the variable \\\\( z \\\\) to a new function which in turn changes the integration pathway of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Hence, the outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) directly depends on the intervening factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), altering both the base and exponential component of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
