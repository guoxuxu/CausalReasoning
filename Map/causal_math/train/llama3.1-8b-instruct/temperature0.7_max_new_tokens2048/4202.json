  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately determine the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\), it's impossible to reliably trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the integral transformation could have significantly altered the trajectory in a manner that is irrecoverable from final observations alone, especially if matrix C does not explicitly relate to A or B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
