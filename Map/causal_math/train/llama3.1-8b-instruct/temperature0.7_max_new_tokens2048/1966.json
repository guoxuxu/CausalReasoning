  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) refers to time. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the function and consider intervention through an inverse Laplace transform at different times.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined from its Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) uniquely specifies \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) due to the one-to-one nature of the Laplace transform for functions of this specific form, assuming initial values and boundary conditions typical in causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
