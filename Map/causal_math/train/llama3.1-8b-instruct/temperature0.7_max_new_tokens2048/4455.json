  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We look at how the Laplace transform affects this function over the variable t, focusing on the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we alter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a different value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) and continue evolving the function, will the function's Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z')(s) \\\\) still depend only on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the function to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), thus altering its Laplace transform to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\). The final Laplace transform depends on the new \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), showing dependence on the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
