  "Problem": "In a controlled heat transfer system, the temperature function, \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution according to the function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), introducing another function \\\\( g(x) = e^{-bx} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant), will the temperature profile at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be dictated solely by the initial thermal diffusivity constant \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention via \\\\( g(x) \\\\) further modifies the temperature distribution, thereby affecting subsequent heat propagation. The final temperature state will depend on both the effects of \\\\( k \\\\), and the combined influences of the transformations introduced by \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
