  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is to be considered.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\exp(i\\\\theta)z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant, real number) is applied as an intervention and then allowed to evolve, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and ignore effects of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the angle of the complex number at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), but since the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) also affects the state’s magnitude, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on both changes. Therefore, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) won’t solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the effects of the initial squaring and the rotational transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
