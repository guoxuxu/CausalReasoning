  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\) used to solve differential equations. Assume the system is initially impacted by a function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\), and later, an intervention using the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(\\\\omega)\\\\) applied to the result.\n\nDoes the application of the Fourier transform as an intervention to the system, after the Laplace transform of \\\\(g(t)\\\\), ensure that the final status of the system in the frequency domain solely depends on \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using the Fourier transform on the result of the Laplace transform introduces additional complexity. The nature of the Fourier transform affecting the modified output from the Laplace domain alters the final outcome in the frequency domain, now dependent on both transformations and not just on \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
