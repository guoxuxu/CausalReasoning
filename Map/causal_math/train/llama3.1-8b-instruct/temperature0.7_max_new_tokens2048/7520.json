  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) defined in the complex plane and let \\\\(F(s)\\\\) denote the Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t)\\\\), where \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is a real-valued function that corresponds to the real part of \\\\(f(z)\\\\). We examine behaviors when \\\\(z\\\\) traverses along different paths in the complex plane.\n\nGiven \\\\(F(s)\\\\), can we definitively distinguish if the path modified at mid-point to an exponential one or remained linear throughout, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting \\\\(F(s)\\\\) could potentially converge to similar outcomes for different paths especially if these paths do not diversely alter the function's behavior within its domain of definition. Additional path-specific markers or direct observations of the path are required for clear distinction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
