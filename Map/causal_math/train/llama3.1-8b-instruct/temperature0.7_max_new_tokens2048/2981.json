  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) and A is a complex matrix. The function undergoes a Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{iAx}\\\\}(s) \\\\. Furthermore, an intervention by a matrix operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied intermittently, transforming \\\\( z(x) \\\\) into \\\\( Mz(x) \\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be affected solely by the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "Because \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{iAx}\\\\}(s) \\\\) explicitly depends on the behavior of \\\\( e^{iAx} \\\\), the resulting transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is directly determined by the matrix A without any other influences under these conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
