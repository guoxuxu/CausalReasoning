  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a transformation given by \\\\( g(u) = (Tf)(u) \\\\), where \\\\( Tf \\\\) represents a Fourier transform over a function f modifying u.\n\nGiven \\\\( u(t) \\\\) observed at t = T, can we deduce precisely whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 solely from this observation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) could have altered the frequency composition of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) in a way that is non-recoverable just by observing the resultant state at t = T under L, especially without additional information on the specifics of L relative to the Fourier components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
