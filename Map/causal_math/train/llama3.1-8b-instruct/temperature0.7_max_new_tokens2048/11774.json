  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem involving an initial matrix \\u0027X\\u0027. The function \\u0027f(X) = e^{At}X\\u0027 transforms \\u0027X\\u0027 over time \\u0027t\\u0027, where \\u0027A\\u0027 is a constant skew-symmetric matrix. This explores changes under the integral transformation using the Laplace Transform of \\u0027X\\u0027.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\u0027t_1\\u0027, the matrix is further acted upon by a function \\u0027g(X) = e^{Bt}X\\u0027 (where \\u0027B\\u0027 is another constant matrix), will the eigenvalues of \\u0027X(T)\\u0027 for \\u0027T > t_1\\u0027 depend exclusively on \\u0027A\\u0027 and not on \\u0027B\\u0027?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent transformation by \\u0027g(X)\\u0027 introduces changes dependent on the matrix \\u0027B\\u0027. This affects the eigenvalues of \\u0027X(T)\\u0027 due to the potential non-commutative nature of \\u0027e^{At}\\u0027 and \\u0027e^{Bt}\\u0027, making the final eigenvalues dependent on both \\u0027A\\u0027 and \\u0027B\\u0027.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
