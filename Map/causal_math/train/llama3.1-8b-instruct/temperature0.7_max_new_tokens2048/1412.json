  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. This function is integrated over time using the transformation \\\\(F(z) = \\int_0^T f(t) z(t) dt\\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of this integral transformation when a parameter adjustment, represented by function \\\\(g(z) = ze^{i\\theta}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant, is either applied initially or during the process.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(F(z)\\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both), strictly from knowing the result at T?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(F(z)\\\\) could arise from a variety of combinations of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) and \\\\(h(z)\\\\), including possible different timings for applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\). Due to the integral properties and the linear phase additions, different paths could lead to equivalent results for \\\\(F(z)\\\\), obscuring the exact sequence or presence of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
