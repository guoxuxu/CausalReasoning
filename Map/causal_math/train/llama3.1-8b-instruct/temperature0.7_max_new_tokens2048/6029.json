  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the input voltage \\( V(t) \\) is transformed by a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) resulting in \\( V(s) \\). The transformed system is characterized by the impulse response function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s + R} \\), where \\( R \\) is a resistance in the circuit. The transformation represents an operation over the input voltage.\n\nIf a step function voltage \\( V(t) = u(t) \\) (unit step function) is applied to the circuit at \\( t = 0 \\) and allowed to evolve under \\( H(s) \\) without further intervention, will the output voltage \\( V_{out}(s) \\) at \\( s = R \\) be the same as if \\( V(t) = u(t) \\) was directly applied to \\( H(s) \\) under the conditions of the impulse response?",
  "Explanation": "The step function voltage transformed by \\( H(s) \\) results in an output \\( V_{out}(s) = H(s) \\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\frac{1}{s(s+R)} \\). When \\( s = R \\), \\( V_{out}(s) \\) evaluates consistently under the scenario described, indicating that the transformation via \\( H(s) \\) accurately represents the input effect without deviation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
