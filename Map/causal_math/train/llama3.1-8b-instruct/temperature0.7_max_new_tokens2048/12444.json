  "Problem": "We consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real variable and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex number. The function is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) along with the application of a scaling and phase shift operation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{a+ib}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be identical to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by an exponential scaling and phase shifting factor, changing the amplitude and phase of the solution. The resulting trajectory will differ and not coincide with the untransformed system, as \\\\( e^{a+ib} \\\\) introduces a permanent modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
