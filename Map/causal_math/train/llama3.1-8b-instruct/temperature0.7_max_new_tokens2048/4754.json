  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the heat distribution over a rod with length L is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where u is the temperature function, k is the thermal diffusion coefficient, and subscript denotes partial derivatives. The Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{f}\\)) is used to analyze conditions and interventions on the temperature profile.\n\nCan we exclusively determine the initial temperature distribution of the rod after observing the temperature distribution at time T without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier transform or another transformation was initially applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the original temperature distribution. The transformation could have modified the heat profile's base conditions, obscuring the direct relationship between final and initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
