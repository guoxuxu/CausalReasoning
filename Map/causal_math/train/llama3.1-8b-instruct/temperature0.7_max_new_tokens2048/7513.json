  "Problem": "Examine the effects of altering the matrix in the linear transformation \\\\(T(v) = Av\\\\) on vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix. Consider the new transformation given by \\\\(f(v) = (A+D)v\\\\) after a perturbation matrix \\\\(D\\\\) is added. Assume both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nIf \\\\(f(v)\\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\(v_0\\\\) and the system evolves under the original transformation \\\\(T(v) = Av\\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\(v(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(v_0\\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\(t = T\\\\) under \\\\(T(v)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The perturbation matrix \\\\(D\\\\) alters the original transformation dynamics by changing the initial transformation. Because \\\\((A+D)v_0\\\\) generally differs from \\\\(Av_0\\\\), the trajectory and thus the final state of the system at \\\\(t = T\\\\) will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
