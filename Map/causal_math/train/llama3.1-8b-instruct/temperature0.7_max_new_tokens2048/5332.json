  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency parameter. We study the effect of the Laplace transform and its inverse in the system, given by the transformations \\\\( f(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(z) \\\\).\n\nGiven only the final state after transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and an unknown intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we detect exactly which interventions (through parameters like \\\\( k \\\\)) were applied by only observing the end state after inverse transforming?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention parameters could lead to indistinguishable final states due to the overlapping effects in transformation and the non-linear characteristics of combining such operations, making it infeasible to uniquely determine the intervention solely from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
