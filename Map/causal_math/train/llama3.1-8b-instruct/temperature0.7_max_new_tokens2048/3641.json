  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that represents the temperature distribution over a rod, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We analyze the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to the initial distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), and then the system evolves according to the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was evolved directly under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) by adding \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) changes the initial condition, thus altering the evolution of the temperature distribution as dictated by the heat equation. The sinusoidal term does not dissipate uniformly under the heat equation, resulting in a different temperature distribution at any time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
