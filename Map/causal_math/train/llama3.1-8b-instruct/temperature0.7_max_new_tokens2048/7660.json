  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine precisely if an intervention by multiplying \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) was applied to the input signal, just by analyzing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) itself, without additional information about the transformation \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) or the nature of alterations applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\), doesn't provide sufficient information to uniquely determine whether the specific intervention \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) was used. Various combinations of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and alterations could result in the same output spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
