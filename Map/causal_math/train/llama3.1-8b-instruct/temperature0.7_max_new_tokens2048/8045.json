  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation on the state vector described by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is computed from initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and then the system evolves under control input \\\\( u \\\\) without further transformation, will the resultant state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be independent of the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) computes an integral over the past trajectory but does not alter the state directly. The future evolution of the system depends only on the dynamics \\\\( Ax + Bu \\\\) and the current state, not on computations derived from past states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
