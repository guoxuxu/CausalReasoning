  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) on a vector space equipped with a linear operator \\\\( L(v) \\\\). The transformation alters vector \\\\( v \\\\) over time via \\\\( v(t) = e^{Mt}v_0 \\\\). The operator's behavior on transformed vectors is given by \\\\( L(v(t)) = e^{Nt}L(v_0) \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an initial vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( M \\\\) without further intervention and then \\\\( L \\\\) is applied, will \\\\( L(v(t)) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) necessarily reflect direct action of \\\\( N \\\\) on \\\\( L(v_0) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although \\\\( L(v(t)) = e^{Nt}L(v_0) \\\\) directly applies \\\\( N \\\\) to \\\\( L(v_0) \\\\), the initial transformation by \\\\( M \\\\) changes \\\\( v_0 \\\\), and the effect of \\\\( M \\\\) can indirectly influence the final state given the dependency of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) on \\\\( M \\\\). This means \\\\( L \\\\)'s output can carry implicit effects of \\\\( M \\\\), albeit transformed through \\\\( N \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
