  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nGiven the final complex number after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can one determine if the interventions were applied in the sequence \\\\( f \\\\) then \\\\( g \\\\), or if they were used in reverse or not used in conjunction?",
  "Explanation": "The non-trivial interplay between adding a constant in the exponential function's phase (via \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) and the sequence of applications (whether \\\\( f \\\\) then \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\) then \\\\( f \\\\) or both at once) results in different paths that could lead to the same outcome. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively ascertain the sequence of interventions solely by the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
