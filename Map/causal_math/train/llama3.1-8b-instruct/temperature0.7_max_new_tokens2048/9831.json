  "Problem": "Consider a system where the evolution of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The impact of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-kt}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) counteracts or modifies the effects of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a result of interplay between \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( -k \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The system's endpoint at T is influenced by both the rotational dynamics introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the scaling adjustments made by \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( -k \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
