  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are complex constants. We evaluate the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z + S \\\\), where R and S are also complex constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is not known, it's impossible to trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately because the transformation could have altered initial conditions in a non-reversible manner, especially when R and S are non-zero or not directly invertible due to their complex nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
