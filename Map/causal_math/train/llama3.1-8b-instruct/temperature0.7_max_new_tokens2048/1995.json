  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Sz \\\\), where S is a constant matrix. The study focuses on the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) implemented at various times t, with D being another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention via a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on S, irrespective of D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) brings another layer of complexity, meaning that the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the matrices D, F, and S. The new transformation \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) impacts the trajectory along with any previously applied transformations, causing a dependency beyond just S.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "D → g(z); S → z; F → h(z); t_1 → h(z); h(z) → z; g(z) → z; t → z; S → z(T); D → z(T); F → z(T)"
