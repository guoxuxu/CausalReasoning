  "Problem": "Consider a signal process represented by a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = L\\{z(t)\\} \\), where \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of an input signal modified by the transformation \\( h(t) = e^{Bt} \\) on the system's response over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention with a new function \\( g(t) = e^{Ct} \\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied, will the system's state \\( z(T) \\) for T > t_1 be influenced by only A and not by B or C?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention with \\( g(t) \\) adds an additional dynamic to the system, affecting the final state \\( z(T) \\) dependent on B, C, as well as A. The transformations \\( e^{Bt} \\) and \\( e^{Ct} \\) alter the system’s trajectory, impacting the outcomes at time T due to their compound effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
