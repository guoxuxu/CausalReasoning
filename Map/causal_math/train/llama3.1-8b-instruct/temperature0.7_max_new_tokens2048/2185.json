  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( L\\{y(t)\\} = Y(s) \\), where \\( y(t) \\) is a function in the time domain and \\( Y(s) \\) is its corresponding representation in the complex frequency domain. Assume an initial condition \\( y(0) = y_0 \\) and study the effects of an impulse response \\( h(t) \\) applied to this system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( H(s) \\).\n\nIf the initial function \\( y(t) \\) is transformed by applying \\( L\\{y(t)\\} \\) and then evaluated under a convolution with \\( h(t) \\) without any interventions, does \\( Y(s)H(s) \\) at \\( s \\) represent the system's state accurately at any time t?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. The system's behavior represented by \\( Y(s)H(s) \\) correctly reflects the system's state after the effect of the impulse response over any time t, demonstrating the linear time-invariant (LTI) property of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
