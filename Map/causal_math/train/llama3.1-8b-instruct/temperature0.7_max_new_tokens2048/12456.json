  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of the function over time t.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) is calculated and then the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) is applied without any intervention, will the resultant function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be the same as the original? ",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform and its inverse form a pair that, when applied consecutively without any alteration or intervention, theoretically reconstruct the original function exactly, provided there are no singularities or convergence issues.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
