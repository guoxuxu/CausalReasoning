  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to a periodic function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Analyze how different types of interventions (applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) depending on a parameter matrix \\\\( P \\\\)) affect the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of a sine wave, can we accurately determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original sine wave without any additional information or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a sine function, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\), uniquely determines the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the sine wave. Since the parameters \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) provide sufficient information to solve for \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), we can recover the frequency directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
