  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then modifying the function using another transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a transfer function in the s-domain.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we conclusively determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original complex exponential \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be deduced from the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The poles of the transform in the s-domain are directly related to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), thereby allowing precise calculation of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
