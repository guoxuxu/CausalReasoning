  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\\\) where A is a matrix and v is a complex constant vector. The system is then subjected to a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\) (where C is another matrix) is imposed at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will this intervention leave the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) unaffected for all times t > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by an additional exponential factor related to the matrix C, impacting how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves past \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and thus altering the outcome of \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). The frequency domain representation will reflect these changes, showing dependencies on both A and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
