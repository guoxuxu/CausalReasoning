  "Problem": "Assume we have a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex square matrix that represents the system's dynamics. Assume further that we can apply a transformation function \\\\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( D \\\\) another complex matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the initial state's derivation from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes complex due to the unknown effects of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\). The transformation may have significantly altered \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and without this knowledge, recovering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is indeterminable.",
