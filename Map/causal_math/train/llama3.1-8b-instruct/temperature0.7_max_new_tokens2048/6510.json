  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is the temperature at a point \\\\((x, y)\\\\). We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions, defined by the function \\\\(g(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(x, y)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) describes initial temperature distribution along the boundary.\n\nCan we deduce the original boundary function \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) after achieving steady-state solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) without any additional information about the Fourier transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) from \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) without knowledge of the specific Fourier components used in \\\\(g(s)\\\\) is infeasible, as many different boundary conditions could lead to similar steady-state distributions inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) due to the loss of information in transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
