  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} =  L u \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We inspect the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} u(x, t) \\\\, dt \\\\), which is the Laplace transform of \\\\( u \\\\) with respect to time.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( F(u) \\\\), can we unequivocally reconstruct the original function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) when \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) compresses the time-domain information into the s-domain, and while inverse transformations exist, precise reconstruction of the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( F(u) \\\\) alone is not guaranteed without further constraints or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
