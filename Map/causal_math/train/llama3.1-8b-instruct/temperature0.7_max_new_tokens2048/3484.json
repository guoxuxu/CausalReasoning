  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We study the implications of modifying this integral using a linear transformation of the variable x given by the function \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nConsidering the final calculated value of \\\\( F(cx + d) \\\\) at T, can we determine precisely which transformations (either \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied based solely on \\\\( F's \\\\) outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Since integral transforms like \\\\( F \\\\) are highly sensitive to changes in their argument's structure and given the overlapping effects of additive and multiplicative constants on transformation and subsequent integration, it's impossible to distinguish uniquely between transformations or a combination thereof just based on the outcome of \\\\( F \\\\). Multiple transformation sequences could lead to the same end result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
