  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), on this function and analyzing its impact on the system's dynamics.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified by a scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\), specifically \\\\( k \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\), does this affect the detected frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) modifies the amplitude of the Laplace Transform but does not affect the location of the pole, which determines the frequency component. The frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) remains discernible and unchanged as it still corresponds to the imaginary part of the pole position in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
