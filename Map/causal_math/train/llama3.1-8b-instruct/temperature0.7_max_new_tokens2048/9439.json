  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u(x, t), resulting in \\\\(U(k, t)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applying an inverse Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) is performed at some time t = t_1 and subsequent evolution proceeds under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), will the system's state at t = T be predictable solely by the knowledge of L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) modifies the state in the original function space, hence the system's subsequent evolution will depend on this altered state as well as the operator L. The dynamics are influenced by both the initial modifications and the natural progression under L, making the outcome dependent on more than just L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
