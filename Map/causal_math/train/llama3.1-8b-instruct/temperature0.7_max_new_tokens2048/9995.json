  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant thermal diffusivity. An external heat source modifies this equation by a term \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\), making it \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + v(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the thermal diffusivity from k to a new constant \\\\( k' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final temperature distribution at time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still be affected by the initial diffusivity k?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of thermal diffusivity part-way through the system's evolution impacts the way heat diffuses through the rod, but the system’s state up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is influenced by the original diffusivity k, and hence the final state at time T will still reflect the effects of both k and \\\\( k' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
