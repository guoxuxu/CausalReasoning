  "Problem": "Analyze the integral transformation \\\\( F(p) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(x) = cos(x) \\\\), where p represents a complex number. We study how changing the parameter p affects the transformation and the resulting function.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) at \\\\( p = 2 \\\\), can we infer the original function's form to be \\\\( cos(x) \\\\), assuming no knowledge about the transformations made by \\\\( p \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether and how p was manipulated, the resulting transformation \\\\( F(p) \\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\( f(x) \\\\), as different functions could yield similar transformations under different p conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
