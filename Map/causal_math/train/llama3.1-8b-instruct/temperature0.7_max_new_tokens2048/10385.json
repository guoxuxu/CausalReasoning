  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system's evolution is governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a positive real constant.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) is given and the system evolves according to the differential equation without any intervention, will the magnitude \\\\( |z(t)| \\\\) remain constant for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z \\\\) corresponds to a simple rotation in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since the rotation preserves the magnitude, \\\\( |z(t)| \\\\) remains constant equal to \\\\( |z_0| \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
