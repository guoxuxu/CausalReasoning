  "Problem": "Consider a system subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse being applied under different scenarios. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes an oscillatory behavior \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an alteration is made in the Laplace domain where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is multiplied by \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\), and then the inverse transform is applied, will the resulting time function reflect only the change due to the intervention, independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\) corresponds to a time-domain shift of the function. The resulting function, \\\\( f(t-1) \\\\), keeps the dependency on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) since it transforms to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega (t-1)} \\\\). Thus the effect is not independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
