  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\(\\\\Delta T(t)\\\\) in a material is governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T\\\\), where \\\\(k > 0\\\\) is a constant related to the thermal conductivity of the material. We examine the effect of an external heating function \\\\( h(t) = H e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant heat input.\n\nIf the external heating function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied from t = 0 and the system evolves according to the given differential equation, will the temperature at time T be the same as if no heating function was applied and only the natural cooling process took place?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the heating function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) significantly alters the system's temperature trajectory. The external heat input modifies the initial rate of temperature change, leading to a higher temperature at any time T compared to the scenario with just natural cooling.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
