  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represent a complex function governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Consider the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then exploring the causal relationships between different transformations applied to \\\\( z \\\\) at various times.\n\nWith an additional exponential damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive real constant) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time T > t_1 be influenced solely by the damping factor, independent of the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the damping factor modifies the original function and its Laplace transform, resulting in a resultant \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) that reflects the impact of both the initial conditions (encoded by \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) and the damping factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The final state at any time T > t_1 is thus a compounded effect of these parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
