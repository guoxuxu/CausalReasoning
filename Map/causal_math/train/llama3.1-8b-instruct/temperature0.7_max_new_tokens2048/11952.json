  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( g(z) \\) defined on the complex plane as \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number. The function is studied under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) which transforms \\( g(t) \\) from the time domain to the complex \\( s \\)-domain.\n\nIf \\( g(t) \\) is transformed using the Laplace Transform without any modifications, will the resulting function \\( G(s) \\) in the \\( s \\)-domain solely depend on the parameter \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\) results in \\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-c} \\), which directly depends on the parameter \\( c \\). The transformation properties ensure that the outcome in the \\( s \\)-domain is uniquely determined by \\( c \\) without requiring any additional intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
