  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(t) = t^ne^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( n \\\\) is a non-negative integer. We investigate causal relations by manipulating this function with and without interventions in the complex function plane.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can the presence of the intervention (damping factor) and the specific values of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( n \\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of the modified function is \\\\( \\\\frac{n!}{(s-(a-b))^{n+1}} \\\\), this form cannot conclusively distinguish whether a damping factor \\\\( b \\\\) was used or if the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) was originally differently valued. There could be a multitude of combinations yielding identical forms of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), hence there’s ambiguity in pinpointing what transformations or interventions occurred solely based on \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
