  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{X} = AX + BU \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and U is a control input. We study the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-Cs}X(s) ds \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on the behavior of the process.\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( T(X) \\\\) at time T and knowing an intervention was made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the nature of the intervention on U?",
  "Explanation": "The output at time T is the result of complex interactions between the response of the system to the initial conditions set by A and B, and the modification by U altered through intervention, against the backdrop of transformation by C. Since various different interventions (differences in U’s change) could lead to similar outputs after transformation, precisely deducing the nature of intervention only from the endpoint is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
