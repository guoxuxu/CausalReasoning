  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time is investigated.\n\nIf during the observation time a multiplicative function \\\\( g(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)g(t)\\\\} (s) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t)g(t) = e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of the new function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha)t}\\\\} (s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\), showing dependence on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
