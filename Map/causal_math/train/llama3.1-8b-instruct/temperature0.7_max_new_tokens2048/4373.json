  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex plane, described by the relation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Consider the effect spatially shifting this function using another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + Ce^{Bt} \\\\), where B and C are constant complex numbers.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 + Ce^{B*0} \\\\). This addition of \\\\( C \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the outset; hence, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ from the trajectory of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) subjected to \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
