  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of t. The Laplace Transform of z is defined as \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). Consider the impact of the differential operator D on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( Dz(t) = z'(t) \\\\) and its effect on the transformed function.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) + w(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is another differentiable function, and then \\\\( D \\\\) is applied followed by a Laplace Transform, does the final result only depend on the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( w(t) \\\\) alters the function to which \\\\( D \\\\) is applied. Consequently, both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) influence the result after the Laplace Transform, producing a final transformed representation that reflects changes due to both functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
