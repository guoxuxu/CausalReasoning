  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process where the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx = Ax \\\\, dt + B \\\\, dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) refers to a Wiener process increment. An operator \\\\( T_t \\\\) defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is constant is considered as a transformation.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( T_t \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the use of the transformation \\\\( T_t \\\\), tracing back to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) becomes ambiguous, particularly because the stochastic element and the potential matrix transformation obscure the path taken by the system starting from the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
