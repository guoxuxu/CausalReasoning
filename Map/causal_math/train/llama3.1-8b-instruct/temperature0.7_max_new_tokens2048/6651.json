  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature dynamics in a reactor is controlled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a rate constant, \\\\(T_e\\\\) is the external temperature, \\\\(T\\\\) is the reactor temperature, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term due to a reaction. The transformation \\\\(f(T) = T^2\\\\) is considered at a time instant to study the impact on the reactor's thermal behavior.\n\nIf an intervention is made at a later time \\\\(t_1\\\\), by applying a new function, \\\\(g(T) = e^{rT}\\\\), where \\\\(r\\\\) is a constant, will the resultant temperature \\\\(T(T)\\\\) be solely dependent on the original dynamics and not on the initial squaring transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention of \\\\(g(T) = e^{rT}\\\\) complicates the system further by introducing a new exponential dependency on the temperature. This change affects the trajectory initiated from either the squared or the non-squared initial state and will interplay in a way that makes the final temperature at \\\\(t = T\\\\) dependent on both the initial transformation and the later intervention.",
