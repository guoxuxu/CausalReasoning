  "Problem": "In a control system analysis, the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) acts on a state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. We explore the changes in state space when applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) at different points in time t.\n\nBased on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine whether initial and subsequent transformations (from \\\\\\\\( g(z) \\\\\\\\) and/or \\\\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\\\) respectively) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The ability to determine specific interventions solely from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is limited due to the potential overlap in effects that the transformations \\\\( e^{tC} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{t+1} \\\\) might have on the trajectory. Multiple trajectories can converge to the same final state, making it uncertain which specific interventions were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
