  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time. The function is transformed by a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We analyze causal inference when altering the frequency spectrum by filtering specific frequency components.\n\nIf a high-pass filter is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention to the frequency-modified signal \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then processed to obtain a time-domain signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\), will the final signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) be independent of the initial low-pass filter applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) will retain the impact of both the low-pass and high-pass filters. The sequential application of these filters influences the frequency components present in \\\\( z''(t) \\\\). Since they focus on different frequency ranges, the aggregation of their effects influences the overall characteristics of the resulting signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
