  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t))(s) \\\\). Furthermore, let \\\\( x(t) \\\\) interact with another function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) through a convolution, resulting in \\\\( y(t) = (x * v)(t) \\\\) which transforms to \\\\( Y(s) = X(s)V(s) \\\\) in the s-domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is altered to \\\\( x(t) + w(t) \\\\) where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is another function with a known Laplace transform, and allowed to evolve under convolution with \\\\( v(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the s-domain still be \\\\( Y(s) = X(s)V(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by adding \\\\( w(t) \\\\) modifies its Laplace transform to \\\\( X(s) + W(s) \\\\). Therefore, the resulting transformation after convolution with \\\\( v(t) \\\\) becomes \\\\( (X(s) + W(s))V(s) \\\\), which is different from the original \\\\( Y(s) = X(s)V(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
