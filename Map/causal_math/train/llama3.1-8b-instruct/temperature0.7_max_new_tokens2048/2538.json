  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. We investigate how the function affects solutions to the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\), where M is another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) at z = Z, can we determine the original vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at z = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) has been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it would be ambiguous whether the observed \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) resulted from a direct application of the differential equation or was modified by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\). The effect of K on the differential path might completely mask the contributions of the original state unless K is a zero matrix.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
