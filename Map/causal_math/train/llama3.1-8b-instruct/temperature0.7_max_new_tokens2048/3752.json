  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix. The transformation of this function under a Laplace transform is investigated.\n\nKnowing the result of a Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we determine whether an intervention with a matrix B was applied to the original matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "From the result of the Laplace transform alone, \\\\( F(s) = (sI - C)^{-1} \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine if this results from A, or A + B (where C can be A or A+B), without additional information about the presence or absence of B. Multiple combinations of A and B can result in the same transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
