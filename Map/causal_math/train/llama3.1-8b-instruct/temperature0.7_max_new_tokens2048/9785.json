  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively. Here, A and B are real constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is considered in the analysis.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is calculated for the original function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) starting at t = 0 to T, and then allowed to evolve naturally under the combined differential equations, will \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at any later time T' > T be identical to the calculation made directly at T' without the initial calculation at T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) involves an integral that accumulates effects over time and thus depends explicitly on the path from 0 to T. Calculation at a different interval, even with the same end time, does not necessarily repeat, due to potential differences in the trajectories of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) over altered time spans.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
