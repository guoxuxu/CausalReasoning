  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyze how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can we deduce the exact form of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) significantly affect the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thereby influencing its Laplace transform. Without knowing these parameters, it is impossible to precisely backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) due to the influence of both the oscillatory term \\\\( i \\\\omega z \\\\) and the linear term \\\\( k \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
