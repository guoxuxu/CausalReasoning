  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\} = U(s, x) \\\\) and the subsequent inversion to the time domain.\n\nIf given \\\\( U(s, x) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) for some t > 0, can we determine the original initial function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion process from the Laplace transform domain to the time domain requires knowledge of the entire spectrum of s-values and appropriate behavior at infinity. Additional conditions at boundaries or specifics on singularities would be necessary, meaning \\\\( U(s, x) \\\\) alone is insufficient for a unique determination of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
