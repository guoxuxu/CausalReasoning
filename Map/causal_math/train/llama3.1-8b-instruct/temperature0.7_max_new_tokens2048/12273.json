  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing dynamic states of a system, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. A transformation defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a complex constant matrix is introduced.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), without prior knowledge of transformation application, is it possible to infer solely from the observed dynamics whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) was initially applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) which incorporates the matrix exponential, and without knowing the precise interactions between A, B, and C, the initial application of the transformation cannot be conclusively determined solely based on the final observed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
