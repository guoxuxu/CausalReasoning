  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the system of differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = -v + cu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = u + cv \\\\), where c is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an initial transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf at some instance \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\theta}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the properties of the differential equations, regardless of the initial transformation by \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), essentially a reverse transformation, still makes the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial transformation and the newly applied intervention, along with how these transformations interact with the dynamics prescribed by the differential equations.",
