  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = w(u) \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex function of the complex variable \\\\( u \\\\). Now investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](u) = \\\\int_C f(v)e^{-uv} dv \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( f \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( T[w](u) \\\\) for some contour C, can we fully recover the original function \\\\( w(u) \\\\) without additional information about \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( T[w](u) \\\\) depends on the contour C and the exponential factor in the integral, which generally loses information about the original function, particularly about any local behaviors or isolated features. Inversion or deconvolution would generally require more information about \\\\( f \\\\) or C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
