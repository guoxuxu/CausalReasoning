  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a Hermitian matrix and i is the imaginary unit, defining oscillatory dynamics. We explore the consequences of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) modifies the phase and potentially the magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the skew-Hermitian matrix B, leading to a different trajectory under the dynamics prescribed by \\\\( iAz \\\\). The system's phase space and state at time T will be altered from what would be achieved by direct evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
