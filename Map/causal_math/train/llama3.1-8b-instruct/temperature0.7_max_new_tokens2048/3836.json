  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function impacts a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\\\), with D being a constant matrix.\n\nIf the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is known, can we determine both the original and changed frequencies (\\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)) applied throughout the period?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying both the initial and changed \\omega values solely based on the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is highly challenging due to the integral interaction of frequencies with the system dynamics and the state’s sensitivity to initial conditions and the entire history of frequency variations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
