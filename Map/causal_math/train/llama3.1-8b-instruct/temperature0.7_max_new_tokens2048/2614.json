  "Problem": "Consider the effects of applying a complex transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iw}z \\\\) on a vector field governed by a Laplace equation \\(-\\Delta u = 0\\). We are examining the system's response over time and the causal inference of operations.\n\nIs it possible to determine the original field configuration \\\\( u(z, 0) \\\\) after observing the field at time T, \\\\( u(z, T) \\\\), without knowing whether the complex transformation was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without this key initial-state information on whether the transformation was applied, one cannot reverse-engineer the field configuration to its original form due to the phase shifts introduced, which affect boundary conditions and other physical characteristics of the field.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
