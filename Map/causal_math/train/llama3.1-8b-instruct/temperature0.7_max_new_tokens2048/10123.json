  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\), which operates in the complex plane. The impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\\\) is investigated, where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at a certain point to \\\\(f'(z) = f(z) + g(z)\\\\), where \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is a new function, will the resulting Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f'\\}(s)\\\\) be a direct addition of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity property of the Laplace Transform implies that the transform of a sum is the sum of the transforms, i.e., \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\{f'(z)\\}(s) = ∇\\mathcal{L}\\{f(z)\\}(s) + ∇\\mathcal{L}\\{g(z)\\}(s)\\\\), assuming both transforms exist and are well-defined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
