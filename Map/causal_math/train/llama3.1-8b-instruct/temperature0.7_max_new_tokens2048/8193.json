  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex number. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) transforms the system at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T equal the state if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the trajectory by scaling and potentially rotating the initial condition based on the value of \\\\( Q \\\\). This leads to an altered state trajectory that will not typically be the same as directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
