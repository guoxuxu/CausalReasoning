  "Problem": "Consider a function space in which solutions to the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 f = 0 \\\\) are investigated, and let \\\\( g(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 \\\\) be a transformation applied to any function \\\\( f \\\\) in this space. Examine the impacts of applying another transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(f) = f + \\\\lambda xy \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the final harmonic function post several transformations and interventions, can we precisely determine the sequence and type of transformations (whether \\\\( g(f) \\\\), \\\\( h(f) \\\\), \\\\( k(f) \\\\), or their combinations) applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The properties of harmonic functions and the transformations that can either preserve, alter, or restore these properties mean multiple combinations of transformations could result in the same final harmonic function. The overlap in effects, and the spectral nature of these transformations, make it challenging to backtrack exactly which operations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
