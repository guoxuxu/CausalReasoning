  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates over time. We study the effect of a Laplace Transform \\\\( F(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(p) \\\\) which transforms the complex-valued function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) after the sinusoidal intervention, can we precisely infer the amplitude \\\\( A \\\\) of the external force used?",
  "Explanation": "Although the spectral characteristics introduced by the sinusoidal force affect \\\\( F(p) \\\\), precisely inferring the amplitude \\\\( A \\\\) just from \\\\( F(p) \\\\) is challenging due to potential overlaps with intrinsic characteristics of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), as well as dependencies on the system's response characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
