  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the input and output of an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The input function is \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the output function is defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^T K(t,s)x(s) ds \\\\). Here T is a constant and the transformation is observed up to time T.\n\nWill the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) be identical if we replace the original kernel function \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\) with \\\\( K'(t,s) = e^{B(t-s)} \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a different constant matrix, assuming \\\\( x(t) \\\\) remains unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the kernel from \\\\( e^{A(t-s)} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{B(t-s)} \\\\) fundamentally alters the interaction of the input function through time effects, likely leading to a different output function \\\\( y(T) \\\\). Matrix A encapsulates specific rates of change and inter-variable relationships which are not necessarily preserved in matrix B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
