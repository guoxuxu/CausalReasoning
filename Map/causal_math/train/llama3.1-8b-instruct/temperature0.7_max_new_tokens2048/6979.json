  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant frequency parameter. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by an additional function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) that adjusts its amplitude, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T > t_1 demonstrate solely the effect of the original \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\) frequency component?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies the amplitude, and potentially the phase, thereby altering the original frequency components present in \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T > t_1 reflects the new characteristics introduced by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), alongside the original frequency determined by \\\\( i\\\\omega z \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
