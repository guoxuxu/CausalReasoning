  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) is initially transformed by applying \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\). We examine how this transformation impacts the integration over a continuous function under different operational conditions.\n\nGiven the integral of a transformed function from x = 0 to 2, can we deduce whether the original function was \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without knowing if transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the integral result and not whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\) was applied does not permit back-calculating to find the original function form due to the exponential change introduced, which obscures the original function's structural properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
