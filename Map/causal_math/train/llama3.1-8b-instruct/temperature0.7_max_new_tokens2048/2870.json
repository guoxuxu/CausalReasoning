  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\) in two dimensions, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential. The complex function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) is applied to the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), with \\\\( w \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nCan the original boundary conditions of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) be deduced after observing the potential function \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) in the domain without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation could have modified the boundary conditions in a complex manner, making it difficult to recover the initial conditions uniquely especially given the influence of the complex exponential on boundary values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
