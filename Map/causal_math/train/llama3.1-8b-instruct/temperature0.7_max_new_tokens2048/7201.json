  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We will explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with A being a real constant, influences the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nIf we transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0 and allow it to evolve naturally without further transformations, will the resultant complex function at any time T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly processed for the same duration without \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) integrates the effect of \\\\( e^{sA}z(s) \\\\) from 0 to T, changing the dynamics from the original \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). This modification fundamentally alters the trajectory, resulting in a distinct function at any time T compared to the unaltered evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
