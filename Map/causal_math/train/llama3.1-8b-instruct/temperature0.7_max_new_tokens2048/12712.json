  "Problem": "Examine the steady-state behavior of a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real valued function satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) for a constant matrix A, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. Consider the Fourier transform applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and its interactions.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves without any external intervention, does the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) differ from the Fourier transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) multiplied by the Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the Fourier transform of the product of two functions (\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\)) is the convolution of their Fourier transforms. Here, the Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) acts like a delta function shifting the spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Thus, the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) equates exactly to the shift of the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
