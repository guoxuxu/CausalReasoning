  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\), and A is a complex number. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( Tz = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another complex number.\n\nIf the function \\\\( Tz \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( Tz \\\\) changes the initial condition influenced by the integral transformation, which integrates the modified behavior over the interval from 0 to T. This will impact the trajectory and ultimately the end state at t = T due to the contribution of \\\\( e^{B(t-\\\\tau)} \\\\) across all previous points.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
