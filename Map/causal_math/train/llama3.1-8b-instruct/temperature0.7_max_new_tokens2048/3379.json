  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent real function and \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the influence of this transformation where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function having both amplitude modulation and phase shift properties based on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by applying a scaling function \\\\( h(y) = ky \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant scaling factor) is made, will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( w \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 dependent not just on the behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) but also significantly influenced by the factors \\\\( w \\\\) (due to the initial transformation) and \\\\( k \\\\) (due to the scaling at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
