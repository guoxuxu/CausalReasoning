  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region \\\\(R\\\\). We study the behavior under a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) and analyze the system's response over a boundary \\\\(S\\\\) conditional on a function \\\\(v = e^{kt} u\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state observations of \\\\( u \\\\) on the boundary at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely the intervention used (whether \\\\( v = e^{kt} u \\\\) or some other function), solely based on \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) on the boundary can result from different transformations due to the potential variety in boundary conditions and interventions. Hence, without further information, it is generally impossible to uniquely deduce the exact nature of the intervention applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
