  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then modifying the function using another transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a transfer function in the s-domain.\n\nIf \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after the Laplace transform and before the inverse transform is computed, will the resulting time-domain function solely depend on the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without being influenced by \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifies \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by potentially amplifying, attenuating, or shifting components of the spectrum of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), thereby altering the resulting time-domain function from its original form. The outcome depends on both the characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
