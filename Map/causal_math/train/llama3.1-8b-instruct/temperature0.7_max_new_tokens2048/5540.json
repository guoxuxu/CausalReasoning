  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis problem where the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is transformed using an integral along a contour \\\\( C \\\\). The contour \\\\( C \\\\) is specified to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Assume that the variable transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to modify the path of integration.\n\nBased on the observed outcome of the integral after transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( i(z) \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied, only by knowing the integral's final value?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral value can result from various combinations or forms of transformations due to the wide-ranging effects transformations can have on the integration path and function values. Without explicit knowledge of the transformations' specifics, especially in complex analysis, it's unfeasible to reverse-engineer accurately which transformation led to the observed outcome. Multiple transformation sequences could result in identical or similar final valuations, reducing identifiability.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
