  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and analyze its effects over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a later time T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied as the initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the Fourier transform was applied, the changes introduced by different frequency components due to thermal diffusion cannot be uniquely reversed to retrieve the original distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). The transformation alters specific frequency amplitudes and phases, complicating back-calculation.",
