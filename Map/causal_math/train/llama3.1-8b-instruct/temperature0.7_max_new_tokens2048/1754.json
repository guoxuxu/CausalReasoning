  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapped in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants, over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) could have altered the initial state in a way that isn't uniquely recoverable just through observing the end state after evolving.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
