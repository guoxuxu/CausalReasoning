  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We investigate the role of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\(F(u)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\), applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention via an inverse Fourier transform \\\\(F^{-1}(v)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{ikx} v(k, t) dk\\\\) is applied, would the resulting state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 still retain the influence of the initial Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of an inverse Fourier transform does not negate the effects of the initial Fourier transform. Both transformations and the system's evolution under differential operator L combine, causing the final state at T to reflect modifications from both the initial Fourier action and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
