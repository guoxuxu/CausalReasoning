  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). This transformation is used in analyzing a system's behavior, where s is a complex variable. The function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) is subjected to a transformation where it is multiplied by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, resulting in a new function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}t^2 \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation by multiplying by \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) (where b is a constant) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will the Laplace transform of the resulting function depend only on the initial transformation parameter a?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) results in a compound effect, resulting in a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{(a+b)t}t^2 \\\\). The Laplace transform will then be \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = 2/(s-(a+b))^3 \\\\), which clearly depends on both a and b, not just a.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
