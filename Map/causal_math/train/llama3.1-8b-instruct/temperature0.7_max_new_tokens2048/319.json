  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\} \\\\). We study the behavior under a convolutional operation with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), such that the resulting function is \\\\( u(t) = (g * h)(t) \\\\) with its Laplace Transform \\\\( U(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filtering function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is introduced at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and is convolved with the current system state \\\\( u(t) = (g * h)(t) \\\\), will the final output's Laplace Transform depend solely on the product of \\\\( G(s) \\\\), \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and the new transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of convolving an additional function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) leads to a new final state where its Laplace Transform \\\\( V(s) \\\\) is the product \\\\( G(s)H(s)F(s) \\\\). The linearity and the associative property of the convolution and Laplace Transform ensure this relationship.",
