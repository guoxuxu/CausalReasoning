  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is considered, which affects the function over time span [0, T].\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformations introduce damping and potential phase shifts that can result in similar effects on the function from different initial transformations. This overlap and the lack of one-to-one correspondence between the input functions and the damping effects they apply make it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions from the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
