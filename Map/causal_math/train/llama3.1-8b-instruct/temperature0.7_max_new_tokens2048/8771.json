  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the causal effects using the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), which transforms this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf during the transformation we add a damping factor, modifying the signal to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(-\\alpha + i\\omega) t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\)), will the resulting Laplace Transform shift the pole to the left in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) alters the exponent in the signal to \\\\( -\\alpha + i\\omega \\\\). This results in a shift of the Laplace Transform pole to \\\\( s = -\\alpha + i\\omega \\), moving it to the left in the complex plane due to the real part \\\\( -\\alpha \\\\), indicating a decaying exponential component in addition to the oscillatory behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
