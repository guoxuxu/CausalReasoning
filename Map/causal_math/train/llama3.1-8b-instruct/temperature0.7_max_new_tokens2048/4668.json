  "Problem": "Consider a physical scenario where heat propagation in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity. We analyze the system's response to a time-dependent boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the heat distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a later time T, is it possible to determine which interventions or boundary conditions (initial or at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) were applied specifically, such as \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) and \\\\( \\cos(\\mu t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions from the heat distribution at a given time is infeasible without additional information. Various combinations of boundary conditions and interventions could lead to overlapping or indistinguishable outcomes in the model's response.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
