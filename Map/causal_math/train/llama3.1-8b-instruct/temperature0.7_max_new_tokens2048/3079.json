  "Problem": "In the context of signal processing, consider a system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) passes through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We study the causal inference of output \\( y(t) \\) resulting from the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) applied to \\( x(t) \\) with frequency representation \\( X(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and similarly \\( Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = H(\\omega)X(\\omega) \\), where \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the transfer function of the system.\n\nAssuming an intervention alters \\( x(t) \\) at time \\( t_0 \\) by adding a delta function \\( \\delta(t-t_0) \\), will this modification independently affect \\( y(t) \\) conditioned only by \\( H(\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\( \\delta(t-t_0) \\) translates to an additional component in \\( X(\\omega) \\). Given the LTI property of the system, the new \\( y(t) \\) results solely from the convolution of \\( x(t) + \\delta(t-t_0) \\) with \\( h(t) \\), thereby affecting \\( y(t) \\) conditioned only by \\( H(\\omega) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
