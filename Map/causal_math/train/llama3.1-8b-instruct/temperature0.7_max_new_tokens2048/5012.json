  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We evaluate the role of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Dt}z \\\\) (where R is a rotation matrix and D is another constant matrix) over time t.\n\nGiven information about the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution, with only the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexities introduced by the interactions of multiple transformations and the base system, the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different sequences or types of interventions. This is exacerbated when considering the non-commutative nature of the rotations and exponential matrix functions, making unique determination of the interventions used impossible based solely on the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
