  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its effect on solutions to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and other similar transformations, impact the behavior of solutions over the complex plane.\n\nGiven the solution endpoint \\\\( w(z) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) only by observing the value at \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( w(z) \\\\) can potentially result from various transformations and interventions due to complex function properties where different parameter combinations might yield similar outcomes. Without additional information, the uncertainty in the complex exponential influences denies a unique backward inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
