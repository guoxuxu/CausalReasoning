  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix and x is a constant complex vector, under the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the resulting \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\\\) for different s values, can it be determined precisely whether the matrix A was changed to B at some time t_1?",
  "Explanation": "Although differences in \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\\\) can suggest changes in the underlying dynamics, uniquely confirming a change from A to B at t_1 solely from the Laplace transform results is typically indeterminate without additional contextual information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
