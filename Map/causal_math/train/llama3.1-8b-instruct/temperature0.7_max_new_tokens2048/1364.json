  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a change in the variable s defined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(t) = t^ke^{At} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and A is a non-zero constant.\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at some value of s, can we accurately reconstruct whether the interventions altered k or A without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The final output of \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is a result of complex interactions between the exponential terms and the polynomial terms due to integrations over t. Without precise information on how either k or A were modified during interventions, deducing exact changes or interventions is highly uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
