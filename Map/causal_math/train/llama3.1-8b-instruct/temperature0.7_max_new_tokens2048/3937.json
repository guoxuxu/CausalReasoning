  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the coupled equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). The influence of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is analyzed under different scenarios.\n\nIf the initial conditions of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) evolve under the given differential equations without intervention, does the structure of the resulting Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) solely depend on the constants A, B, C, and D?",
  "Explanation": "Since the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly depends on the matrix coefficients A, B, C, and D, and no external modifications or transformations are applied to the system, the resulting Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is determined purely by these coefficients.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
