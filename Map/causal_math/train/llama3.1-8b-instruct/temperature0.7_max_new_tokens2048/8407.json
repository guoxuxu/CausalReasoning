  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relations in a linear system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We then consider the impact of invoking transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) on vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and on the time evolution described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive transformations alter the path of the system's evolution in a significant way. Starting from \\\\( e^{Bt_1}z_0 \\\\) and then applying \\\\( e^{C(T-t_1)} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will clearly be influenced by the nature of all matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). Each contributes to the trajectory and final form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), indicating a dependency on all involved transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
