  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = w(u) \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex function of the complex variable \\\\( u \\\\). Now investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](u) = \\\\int_C f(v)e^{-uv} dv \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( f \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nIf we modify \\\\( w(u) \\\\) by another transformation \\\\( S[g](u) = \\\\int_D g(v)e^{uv} dv \\\\) at a certain time and then apply \\\\( T \\\\), will the resulting function depend solely on the new transformation \\\\( S \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( w(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transformation, when applying \\\\( T \\\\) after \\\\( S \\\\), would reflect the compositions of the transformations and their respective integrals over contours C and D. As both transformations involve exponential factors with possibly different contours and functions, the final outcome is a complex interplay and cannot depend solely on \\\\( S[g] \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
