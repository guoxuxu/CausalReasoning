  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the role of an operator transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix with complex entries.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through a function \\\\( k(z) = Pz \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) is a permutation matrix, is applied, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( P \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) disrupts the system’s normal progression by rearranging vector components, which influences its trajectory in conjunction with the initial alteration by \\\\( D \\\\). Hence, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the original matrix transformations \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( P \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\), not solely on \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
