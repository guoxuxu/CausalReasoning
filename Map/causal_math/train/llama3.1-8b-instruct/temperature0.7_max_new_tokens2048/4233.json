  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time system represented by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( u(s) \\\\) a varying vector function of time. Study the effect of applying a temporal shift transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\), with \\\\( \\tau \\\\) a time shift constant and \\\\( B \\\\) another matrix.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the input function \\\\( u \\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the system evolves under the integral equation without further intervention, will \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be affected by the transformation \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the transformation \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\), the input function is altered early in the system trajectory, impacting how \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the integral equation. The shift and matrix \\\\( B \\\\) change the integration dynamics and therefore the state output at any time T, dependent on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
