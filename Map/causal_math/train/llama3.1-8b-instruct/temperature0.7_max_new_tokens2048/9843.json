  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the equation \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)](s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) = z(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent complex function.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where the function is modified to \\\\( g(t) = (z_0 + a) e^{kt} \\\\) with constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\), will the resulting function at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) when analyzed through \\\\( L[g(t)](s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the initial condition and the exponential growth factor, thereby affecting the overall function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The resultant Laplace transform \\\\( L[g(t)](s) \\\\) will thus depend on the newly introduced parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\), reflecting changes in both magnitude and rate of growth.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
