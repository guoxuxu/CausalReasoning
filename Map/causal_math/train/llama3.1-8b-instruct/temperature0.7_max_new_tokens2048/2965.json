  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time t according to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf an initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) is used at t = 0 and then evolved under the specified equations without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T exhibit the same behavior as a directly transformed and then evolved function?",
  "Explanation": "The initial integral transformation modifies the time behavior of the function, interacting with the dynamics dictated by A and B. Therefore, starting with \\\\( T[z_0](t) \\\\) and subsequently evolving it under A and B will not yield the same end function as transforming an already evolved function, due to the non-commutative nature of differential operators and integral transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
