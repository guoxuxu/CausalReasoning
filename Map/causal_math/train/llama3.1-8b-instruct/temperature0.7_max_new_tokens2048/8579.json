  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential V(x) in one dimension governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) \\\\). We investigate the effect of a linear transformation of the momentum variable \\\\( p \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(p) = ap \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(p) = bp \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original Hamiltonian H and not on a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(p) \\\\) introduces another scale factor that modifies the momentum again, affecting the kinetic energy and thus the trajectory. Consequently, the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on the values of a and b as well as the original Hamiltonian H.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
