  "Problem": "Investigate the system described by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant. We apply transformations using the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) and study the effect at time \\( t \\).\n\nKnowing the outcome \\( z(T) \\), is it possible to precisely determine if transformations \\( F(s) \\) and/or \\( G(s) \\) were applied, just from \\( z(T) \\), especially when no details of \\( F(s) \\) or \\( G(s) \\) are provided?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the applied transformations from \\( z(T) \\) alone is infeasible without additional constraints or information. Both \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) could individually or collaboratively lead to similar outputs due to the potential overlapping properties in the Laplace transform functions, making it impossible to deduce the interventions used uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
