  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state of the system. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) essentially modifies the baseline condition to \\\\( e^{Bt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0. Consequently, the trajectory of the system evolves differently due to the additional influence of B, resulting in a distinct state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
