  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = T^{-1}e^{Dt}Tx \\\\) is considered, where T is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( k(x) = S^{-1}e^{Ft}Sx \\\\) (where S is a constant matrix and F is a diagonal matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on T, D, or S, F?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( k(x) \\\\) further alters the trajectory of the system. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on the initial transformation by \\\\( h(x) \\\\), the system's dynamics under M, and the later intervention by \\\\( k(x) \\\\). Interactions among these transformations can be highly nonlinear and dependent on the exact forms of T, D, S, and F.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
