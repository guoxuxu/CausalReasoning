  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The function is modified by an integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt}z(t) dt \\\\), with B as another real constant.\n\nCan we precisely identify whether only \\\\( G(z) \\\\), only \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or both were applied by solely examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the end of the period?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the compound and overlapping effects of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) and \\\\( H(z) \\\\) through their respective integral transformations with different constants (B and C), different combinations of these transformations might yield similar or even indistinguishable outcomes at \\\\( T \\\\). This ambiguity prevents uniquely identifying the interventions used without additional information on the system dynamics and initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
