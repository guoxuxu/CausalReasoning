  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in a two-dimensional plane over time t. The transformation defined by the integral \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T without knowing the value of s?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation includes the complex exponent \\\\( s \\\\), which could variably alter the amplitude and phase of each element within \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without the exact value of s, the inverse transformation to retrieve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is not uniquely defined, leading to ambiguous reconstructions of the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
