  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where a system is transformed by the matrix function \\\\( f(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is an invertible matrix. The system's behavior and outcomes are then studied under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is another matrix, to observe the evolution of the system over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(x) = Mx \\\\) was applied, it's challenging to trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely. The transformation by \\\\( M \\\\) could significantly alter \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in ways that are not reversible just by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) evolved under \\\\( g(x) = Nx \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "We cannot deduce the original vector x_0 at t = 0 without knowing whether f(x) was applied because M → f(x) and f(x) → x(T) and x(T) → x_0, but the relationship between x_0 and x(T) is dependent on the application of f(x), which is unknown."
