  "Problem": "Imagine examining the relationship between the continuous applications of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the domain of complex functions and its inverse operations with operators involving complex conjugation. Suppose the complex function is defined as \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and the operation under scrutiny is \\\\( g(f(t)) = \\\\overline{f(t)} \\\\), which takes the complex conjugate of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(f(t)) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves naturally without further intervention, will the resulting function at t = T be the same as if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) had only been transformed directly by the Laplace transform at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(f(t)) = \\\\overline{f(t)} \\\\) shifts the function into its complex conjugate, thereby altering its phase. When this altered function is subjected to the Laplace transform, the path of integration and resulting transform domain will differ from that of the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) transformed directly, generating different outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
