  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t)) \\\\) applied to the spatial component of \\\\( u \\\\) and how it translates through time.\n\nCan the specific intervention (application of H) be definitively determined just by examining \\\\( u(T) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the intervention's details?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the use and nature of H, multiple different interventions could hypothetically produce equivalent outcomes at \\\\( u(T) \\\\). The modification introduced by H in the Fourier space can be mimicked by various other operators, leading to non-unique inference of the applied intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a specific intervention (H) influences the function u, which in turn affects its time derivative u_t, and consequently, the spatial component of u at a later time (u_T)."
