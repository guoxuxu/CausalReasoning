  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\), where s is a complex variable. We advance to analyze the system transformed by the Laplace transform with respect to s, denoted by \\\\( L \\\\{ z(s) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nGiven only the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\{ e^{s^2} \\\\} \\\\), can you infer the exact form of the original function without additional information about the form or features of the function?",
  "Explanation": "Laplace transforms are not generally bijective across all possible functions, particularly for complex-valued functions like \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\), leading to difficulties in uniquely identifying the original function based only on its Laplace transform without specific preconditions or additional boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform → function form; s → complex variable; e^x → exponential function"
