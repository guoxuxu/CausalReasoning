  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\( g(x) \\) defined on \\([0, \\infty)\\) given by \\( G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx \\), often referred to as the Laplace Transform. We are investigating the effects of pre-multiplying \\( g(x) \\) by another function \\( h(x) \\), resulting in \\( H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} h(x)g(x) \\, dx \\).\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is a scaling function (e.g., \\( h(x) = e^{ax} \\)) applied to \\( g(x) \\) at \\( x = 0 \\), and then allowed to evolve under the integral transformation without further intervention, will \\( H(s) \\) at \\( s \\) be the same as if \\( g(x) \\) was directly transformed to \\( s \\) under \\( G(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling function \\( h(x) = e^{ax} \\) will change \\( g(x) \\) to \\( e^{ax}g(x) \\), modifying the Laplace Transform result due to the exponential shift property. Specifically, the transform becomes \\( G(s-a) \\), and thus depending on \\( a \\), \\( H(s) \\) will not simply be \\( G(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
