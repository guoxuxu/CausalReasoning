  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Suppose we apply the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) periodically at times \\\\(t_n = nT\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is an integer and \\\\(T\\\\) a constant interval.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) be the same as without applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) modifies the initial condition, scaling it by \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha T}\\\\). The evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the differential equation from this new initial state results in a different trajectory and endpoint at \\\\(t = T\\\\), due to the exponential factor introduced, which scales the magnitude and rotates the phase of the complex number.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
