  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, obeying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\). We study the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) fundamentally changes the initial condition, making it impossible to reverse engineer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation was applied. The uncertainty in the scaling factor introduced by \\\\( k \\\\) ensures the original state cannot be derived uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
