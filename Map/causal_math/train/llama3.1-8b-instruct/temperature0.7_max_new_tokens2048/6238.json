  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix \\\\omega} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) on the solution.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) perfectly from the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) at t = T knowing that a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier transform is theoretically reversible, the transformation interacts with the evolution under \\\\(L\\\\), potentially altering characteristics of the original function that cannot be exactly recovered without explicit knowledge of the intervening dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
