  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{gz} \\\\) where g is a complex constant. This function is used to transform the path of integration in the complex plane for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_C e^{z^2} dz \\\\), where C is initially the real axis from -∞ to +∞.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( I \\\\) computed along the transformed path \\\\( C' \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the original path \\\\( C \\\\) without any additional information about \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge about the transforming function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the effect it has on the path, determining the original path solely based on the integral's resulting value is not feasible. The function could potentially map multiple different paths to a similar resultant path, or the integral might not provide enough information to infer the specifics of the original path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
