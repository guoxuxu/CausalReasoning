  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation \\\\(L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s)\\) of a function f(t). Assume that the function is multiplied by a time-dependent factor, resulting in a new function \\\\(g(t) = t^n f(t)\\\\) where n is a non-negative integer. Analyze the transformations under various conditions.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by adding an exponential decay factor \\\\(e^{-at}\\\\) (where a > 0 is a constant) to the function g(t), will the resultant Laplace transform be dependent only on the original function f(t) and not the exponent n?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\(e^{-at}\\\\) to g(t) results in the Laplace transform being dependent on both the original function f(t) and the exponent n. This is because the effect of \\\\(t^n\\\\) still significantly modifies how the decay factor integrates into the system, affecting the Laplace domain outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "n → g(t); a → g(t); t → g(t); f(t) → g(t); g(t) → Laplace transform; a > 0 → exponential decay; t → exponential decay; n → exponential term"
