  "Problem": "Analyze the causal effects in a control system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu \\\\) where \\\\(D\\\\) is a dynamics matrix and \\\\(B\\\\) is a control matrix. We study the influence of applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(Cx) \\\\) where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix to the state vector \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the system by transforming \\\\( x_0 \\\\) through a sinusoidal function, which inherently alters the trajectory due to the non-linear transformation effect prior to the influence of \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
