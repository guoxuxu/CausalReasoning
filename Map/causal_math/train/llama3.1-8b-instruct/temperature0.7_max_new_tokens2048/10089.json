  "Problem": "Consider the inversion of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + cz\\\\) where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. We assess the effect of the Laplace transform on the inversion process determined by the equation \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{az}g(z))(s)\\\\) where \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is another function of \\\\(z\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is a direct multiplier of \\\\(e^{az}\\\\) in the domain of the complex function \\\\(z\\\\) from the start, without further modifications or transformations, will the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\) clearly reflect the multiplicative interaction of \\\\(e^{az}\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The properties of the Laplace transform ensure that the multiplication of functions in the time domain results in a convolution in the s-domain. Thus, \\\\(F(s)\\\\) will encapsulate the multiplicative characteristics of \\\\(e^{az}\\\\) with \\\\(g(z)\\\\), directly translating this result without interference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
