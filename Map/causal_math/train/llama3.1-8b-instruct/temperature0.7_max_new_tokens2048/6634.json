  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system is subject to an input function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) affecting the system's state. An integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform, is used to analyze the behavior over time.\n\nBased on the transformed state \\\\( U(s) \\\\), and knowing the system's operator L, can we uniquely determine the original input function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the system's dynamics (L) and the transformed state \\\\( U(s) \\\\), the reverse determination of the input function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) from \\\\( U(s) \\\\) requires the inverse Laplace transformation, which can be non-unique or ill-posed without further constraints or data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
