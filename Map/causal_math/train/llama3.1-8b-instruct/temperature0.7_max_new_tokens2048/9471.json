  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) where \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\), and \\( x, y \\) are real variables. Here, we further explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\( T[f](\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x, y) e^{-i\\omega x} dx \\) on this system.\n\nIf, after computing \\( T[f](\\omega) \\), an intervention modifies \\( f \\) into \\( g(x, y) = x^3 + i\\omega y^2 \\), and \\( T[g](\\omega) \\) is then calculated, will \\( T[g](\\omega) \\) only depend on the new function \\( g \\) and not the earlier \\( T[f](\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T[g](\\omega) \\) is dependent on the new form of \\( g \\), but understanding its deviation from \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) requires knowledge of both the transformation applied and the prior state. The earlier \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) provides context that contributes to an understanding of how the transformation and the original function's contributions evolve over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
