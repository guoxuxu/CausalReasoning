  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output, \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is derived from the input, \\\\( x(t) \\\\), via a complex function and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bx(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential.\n\nCan we determine the exact nature, timing, and formula of an intervention on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) purely based on observing the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some fixed time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and potential similarities in the integrated outcomes of different inputs and interventions over time, it is impossible to uniquely reverse engineer the exact intervention (when, how, and what changes were made to \\\\( x(t) \\\\)) solely from the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation masks specifics due to integration and overlapping effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
