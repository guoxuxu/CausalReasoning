  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) applied on a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Further, investigate the causal relationship when we apply an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\{ G(\\\\omega) \\\\} = g(t) \\\\) on a frequency domain representation \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) using the Laplace transform at t = 0 and then transformed back to time domain using the inverse Laplace transform without any modifications, does \\\\( f(t) \\\\) remain unchanged for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The property of the Laplace transform and its inverse guarantees that if a function is transformed and then inversely transformed without any external modifications, the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is recovered exactly for all t, given the transformations are correctly applied and all necessary conditions are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(t) → F(s); F(s) → f(t) via Laplace transform; f(t) → G(ω); G(ω) → g(t) via Fourier transform; f(t) → g(t) via Laplace and inverse Fourier transform"
