  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) operating on the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. We explore how linear transformations given by matrices affect this function through Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\), characterized as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed frequency function \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\), can we determine the specific matrix \\\\( A \\\\) used to modify \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) before taking the Fourier Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) encapsulates the effect of \\\\( A \\\\) as an integral part of its transformation but abstracts out explicit parameters of \\\\( A \\\\), such that multiple matrices could result in the same or similar changes in \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\). Thus, identifying \\\\( A \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) isn't feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
