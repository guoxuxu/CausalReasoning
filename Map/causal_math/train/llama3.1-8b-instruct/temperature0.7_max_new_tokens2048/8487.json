  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the Laplace transform of a function f(t), given by F(s) = \\\\(\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\). The behavior of the system is also influenced by a Fourier transform transformation, defined by G(ω) = \\\\(\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iωt}f(t) dt\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time t_1 a filtering operation, defined by application of another transform H(t) = t*f(t), is applied as an intervention, will the resulting Fourier transform G(ω) be exclusively dependent on the initial Fourier transform and unaffected by the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the functional transformation H(t) introduces new dynamics, altering both time and frequency domain characteristics of f(t). This change in the source function directly challenges the exclusivity of dependency on either Fourier or Laplace transformations in predicting the final state G(ω).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
