  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation governed by \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative, \\\\( u_{xx} \\\\) is the spatial second derivative, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the heat equation is solved to t = T without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly used to solve to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\) alters the initial state by adding a decaying exponential term, which influences the solution's behavior differently over time as compared to the original equation solved with just \\\\( u_0 \\\\). The additional term dissipates over time but initially affects the heat distribution, leading to a different temperature profile at any later time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
