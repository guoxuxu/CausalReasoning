  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{i\\omega z}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\) are constants, in the context of complex function analysis. The scenario will analyze the impact when \\( z \\) is transformed by different contour integrations in the complex plane.\n\nFrom observing the result of the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over a closed contour, can one definitely infer the value of \\( a \\) without prior knowledge of \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the value of \\( \\omega \\) influences the oscillatory behavior of the exponential in \\( f(z) \\), the final integral result can be the same for different combinations of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\). This leads to ambiguity in determining \\( a \\) without specific knowledge of \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → f(z); z → f(z); a → f(z); z → ∫f(z); ∫f(z) → a; ∫f(z) → ω; z → ∫f(z) is not causal; ω → a is not directly causal; a → ω is not directly causal"
