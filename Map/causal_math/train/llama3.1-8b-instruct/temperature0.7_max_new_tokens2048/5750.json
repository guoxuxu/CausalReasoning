  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system defined by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\), where D is a matrix representing the system dynamics and B is the input matrix controlling the system through input u. We test the effect of a specific integral transformation, defined by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^Te^{Dt}Budt \\\\), on the system's behavior over an interval [0, T].\n\nCan we deduce the initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) or the input u by solely observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after the evolution, assuming no knowledge if the integral transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clarity on the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and the nature of the input u during [0, T], recovery of the initial conditions or the exact input from the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is infeasible; multiple input scenarios could yield the same end state under different initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
