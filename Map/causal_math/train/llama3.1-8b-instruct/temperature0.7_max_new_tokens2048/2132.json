  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t))(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the original time domain function. Investigate the effect of inverse Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s))(t) \\\\) and the influence of multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\) in the s-domain on this relationship.\n\nCan we determine whether \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) was multiplied by \\\\( s \\\\) before applying the inverse Laplace transform just by observing the final time domain result \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information, multiple transformations (like multiple differentiations or integrations followed by transformations) could yield the same or indistinguishably similar functions in the time domain. Hence, we cannot precisely identify if multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\) was the specific intervention used based purely on \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
