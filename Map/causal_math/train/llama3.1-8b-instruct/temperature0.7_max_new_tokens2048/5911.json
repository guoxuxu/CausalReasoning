  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function z on an integral transformation defined by the integral operator T, where \\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\) over a contour \\( \\\\gamma \\) in the complex plane. Here, z is a complex number and \\( f(t) \\) is a function of the complex variable t.\n\nIf an external operation modifies the function \\( f(t) \\) at a specific time t1 within the path \\( \\\\gamma \\), turning it into g(t), and then the integral \\( T[g](z) \\) is computed for the same z, does the result of \\( T[g](z) \\) depend solely on the original function f and z?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function integrated, directly affecting the output. Even with the same z, the transformation result \\( T[g](z) \\) cannot be exclusively linked to the original terms since g(t) alters the integrand significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
