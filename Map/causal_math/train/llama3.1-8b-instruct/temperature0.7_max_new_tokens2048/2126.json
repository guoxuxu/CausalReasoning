  "Problem": "Consider a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( F(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is an initial function. This scenario examines the effects of various manipulations on the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) in terms of how it impacts \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nBased on the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alone at a set of time points, can we uniquely determine which function, \\\\( g(s) \\\\) or \\\\( h(s) \\\\), was initialized if both lead to a possible solution?",
  "Explanation": "If multiple candidate functions, such as \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and \\\\( h(s) \\\\), can lead to viable solutions that satisfy the conditions for the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it would be challenging or impossible to uniquely ascertain the original function without additional information, due to the potential for differing functions to result in the same transformed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
