  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) and A is a matrix. We analyze the causal effect of a matrix intervention \\\\( B \\\\) on function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+B)t} \\\\) and its corresponding transformed function over time.\n\nAfter observing the results of \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) with function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+B)t} \\\\), can we conclusively determine the individual contributions of A and B without knowing the initial function?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation combines the effects of A and B in a way that the resultant function's dependency on individual matrices cannot be deciphered solely from \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\). The transformation effectively blends the impacts of A and B, making them indistinguishable without prior knowledge of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
