  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor R and an inductor L in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(V(t)\\\\) denotes the applied voltage. We introduce a transformation \\\\(g(I) = I + ct\\\\), where c is a constant, applied to the current I at time t.\n\nKnowing the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\(g(I)\\\\) was initially applied, without other interventions or information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the initial conditions or whether the transformation \\\\(g(I)\\\\) was applied, it's impossible to distinguish if the difference in current is due to initial transformation or because of natural variations in \\\\(V(t)\\\\) or other system parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
