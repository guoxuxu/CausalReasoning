  "Problem": "In a study of fluid dynamics, let \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid on a plane, subject to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\). We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nCan we determine what additional terms (like damping) were added during the evolution by merely observing the Fourier transform of the outcome \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, T) \\\\) and knowing the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "Although changes in the Fourier domain hint at modifications in the dynamics, ambiguities due to possible overlap between natural system dynamics and introduced terms prevent exact back-calculation of interventions. There might be multiple valid explanations for observed changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
