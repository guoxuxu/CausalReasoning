  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the initial value problem defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{du}{dx} + q(x)u = 0 \\\\) with initial conditions. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to simplify this differential equation to a form involving complex functions.\n\nIf after applying the Laplace Transform an additional modifying transform, say a Fourier Transform, is used and then invertibly transformed back, will the resulting function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) reflect changes due only to the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional transform such as the Fourier Transform introduces new variables and potentially alters the solutions characteristics. Although the original differential equation governs the behavior of \\\\( u(x) \\\\), the additional transformation impacts the final outcome, modifying the original solution structure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
