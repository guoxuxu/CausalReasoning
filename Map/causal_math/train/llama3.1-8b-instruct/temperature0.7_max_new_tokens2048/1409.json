  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. This function is integrated over time using the transformation \\\\(F(z) = \\int_0^T f(t) z(t) dt\\\\). Let's analyze the behavior of this integral transformation when a parameter adjustment, represented by function \\\\(g(z) = ze^{i\\theta}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant, is either applied initially or during the process.\n\nIf the parameter adjustment \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(0)\\\\) at t = 0, and the function is then left to evolve as \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) over the period from 0 to T, will the result of \\\\(F(z)\\\\) for T > 0 be the same as if \\\\(z(0)\\\\) was not adjusted?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at the initial time t = 0 modifies the trajectory by introducing a phase shift \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\). Consequently, the entire function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is affected by this phase for all t, leading to a different result for \\\\(F(z)\\\\) due to the change in the integral's limits and the properties of complex exponentials.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
