  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a system in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P + iQ)z \\\\), with real matrices P and Q. Examine the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{(C + iD)t}z \\\\), where C and D are also real matrices.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we accurately reverse-engineer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduces complexity due to the possibly non-commuting nature of exponential terms \\\\( e^{(C + iD)t} \\\\) and the differential operator \\\\( (P + iQ) \\\\). Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
