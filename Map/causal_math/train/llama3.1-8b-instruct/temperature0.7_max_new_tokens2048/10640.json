  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex system where the temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The system undergoes an intervention where for \\( t \\geq t_0 \\), an external source \\( S(x,t) = A e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) (where \\( A \\) and \\( \\\\omega \\) are constants) heats the system.\n\nGiven the temperature \\( T(x,T) \\) at a time \\( T \\) post-intervention, can we determine the exact parameters of the source \\( S(x,t) \\) or if such a source was definitely applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of the final temperature \\( T(x,T) \\) alone doesn't allow for the precise deduction of \\( S(x,t) \\)'s parameters or even confirm its application because multiple configurations or initial conditions \\( T_0(x) \\), along with different parameters for \\( S(x,t) \\), could lead to the same \\( T(x,T) \\). The underlying dynamics are too complex for a unique causal inference from effect to cause solely based on the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
