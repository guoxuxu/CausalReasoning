  "Problem": "Analyze a climate model where temperature (T) at time t is given by \\\\( T(t) = T_0 e^{kt} \\\\), where T_0 is initial temperature and k is a growth rate parameter. A study is performed to understand the impact of a carbon emission reduction strategy represented by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-rt}T(t) \\\\), where r is the rate of emission reduction.\n\nKnowing the temperature at \\\\( T(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which intervention was used (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or none), solely based on the observed temperature?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed temperature could be achieved through different intervention strategies due to the exponential nature of the reductions. Without additional data to differentiate the rates of emission reduction, we cannot ascertain which method, if any, was employed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
