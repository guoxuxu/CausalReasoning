  "Problem": "We examine a system governed by the heat equation in a rod, \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(x\\\\) is the position along the rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal conductivity. Consider an initial sinusoidal temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\pi x)\\\\). Suppose an external heating function \\\\(h(x, t) = H e^{-t}\\\\sin(\\\\omega x)\\\\) is applied, modifying the temperature.\n\nGiven a temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) and knowing an intervention occurred, can we specify precisely whether the intervention was the initially described heating function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\), assuming no information on the function form or parameters is available?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the form or parameters of the heating function, it is impossible to conclusively determine that the intervention was exactly \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) and not some other form of heating or modification. The observed temperature could result from various possible interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
