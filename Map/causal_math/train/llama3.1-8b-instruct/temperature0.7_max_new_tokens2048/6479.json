  "Problem": "A vector field $V(z)$ in the complex plane behaves according to the equation $V(z) = z^n$ where $n$ is an integer. We examine the consequences of applying a transformation $f(z) = e^{i \\theta}z$ where $\\theta$ is a constant angle.\n\nIf at a certain time $t_1$, a new function $g(z) = e^{i \\phi}z$ (where $\\phi$ is a constant angle) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint $V(z(T))$ for $T > t_1$ depend only on $n$ and not on $\\theta$ or $\\phi$?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with $g(z)$ introduces another angle of rotation, making the final state $V(z(T))$ dependent not only on $n$ but also on $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. The effects of the transformations $e^{i \\theta}z$ and $e^{i \\phi}z$ cannot be independently negated or isolated, affecting the final output.",
