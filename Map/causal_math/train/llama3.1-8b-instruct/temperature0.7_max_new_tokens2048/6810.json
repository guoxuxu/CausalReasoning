  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the modified function and its interpretation.\n\nGiven the output of the Laplace transform after applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing it was transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform significantly modifies the initial function, making it challenging to revert or deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from the Laplace domain output without explicit knowledge of the transformation applied. The frequency-domain effects complicate the direct inversion to the time-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
