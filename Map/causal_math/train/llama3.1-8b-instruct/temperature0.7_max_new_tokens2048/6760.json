  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bx^2 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy - Dy^2 \\\\) where A, B, C, D are constants. We explore the effects of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\), where E is a constant, applied at various points in time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations or interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) by analyzing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the exponential nature of the transformations, multiple combinations of E and F might result in the same or indistinguishable endpoints at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is insufficient to uniquely trace back and identify which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
