  "Problem": "Assume the eigenvalues of a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) are being tracked over time within the context of the characteristic polynomial \\\\( p_A(t) = \\\\text{det}(A - tI) \\\\). We consider the intervention of a matrix function \\\\( f(t, A) = A + tB \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix that commutes with \\\\( A \\\\).\n\nCan the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) be precisely deduced from observing the characteristic polynomial \\\\( p_{A}(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), without knowing if \\\\( B \\\\) had been added?",
  "Explanation": "Because the functional form of \\\\( f(t, A) \\\\) leaves \\\\( A \\\\) unchanged at \\\\( t=0 \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) commutes with \\\\( A \\\\), the characteristic polynomial \\\\( p_A(T) \\\\) observed at \\\\( T \\\\) would still reflect the eigenvalues of the original \\\\( A \\\\), enabling exact deduction of \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
