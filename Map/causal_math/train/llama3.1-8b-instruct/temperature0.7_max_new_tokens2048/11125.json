  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) \\) modifies the initial state \\( z_0 \\) to \\( e^{Ct}z_0 \\), thus beginning from a different state than \\( z_0 \\). The evolution under \\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) from this altered initial condition yields a path influenced by both A and the properties of C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
