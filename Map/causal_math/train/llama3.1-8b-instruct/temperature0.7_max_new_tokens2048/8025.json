  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in two-dimensional space over time. We analyze how the system behaves under the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( f(z_0) = e^{A(0)}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as time progresses, the evolution according to \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) changes the trajectory based on A's value. This affects the growth rates and rotations of the real and imaginary components differently than if evolving naturally without the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
