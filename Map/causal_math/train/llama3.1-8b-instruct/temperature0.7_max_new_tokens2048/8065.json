  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a dynamic process in the complex plane. The function is initially transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. Then, the system evolves according to the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Bz \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{AT}z_0 \\\\), which then evolves differently under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\) compared to the untransformed initial condition. This transformation and subsequent evolution can alter the trajectory and thus the resultant state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
