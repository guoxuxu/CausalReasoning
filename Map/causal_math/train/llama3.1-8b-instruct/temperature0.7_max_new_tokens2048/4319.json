  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), widely known as the Laplace transform, applied to the function over time.\n\nIf after applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), an intervention modifies the transform by a factor \\\\( (s - a)^{-1} \\\\), will the time-domain behavior of the modified function depend solely on the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the transform, affecting its inverse and thus the behavior of the resulting time-domain function. The final function becomes a convolution of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), making the behavior dependent on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
