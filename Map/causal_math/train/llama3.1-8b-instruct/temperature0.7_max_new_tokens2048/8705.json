  "Problem": "Analyze a transfer function H(s) in the Laplace transform domain. Consider a linear system characterized by H(s) = 1/(s^2 + as + b), where a and b are constants. Let's study the impact of applying a unit step input U(s) = 1/s, and how it influences the system response.\n\nIf a unit step function U(s) is applied as input at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve under H(s) without further intervention, will the response Y(s) = H(s)U(s) at time t = T be the same as directly applying H(s) to any other s-domain input at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying U(s) results in a specific response shaped by the convolution of U(t) and h(t), the inverse Laplace transform of H(s). The response is uniquely due to the impulse response of the system in time domain, different from responses to inputs other than the step.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
