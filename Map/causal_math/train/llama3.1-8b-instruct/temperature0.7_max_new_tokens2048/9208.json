  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), with M being a linear operator. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), applied to the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\), transforming it into the s-domain.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( X(s) \\\\) after interventions, can we precisely determine whether the original or the modified system dynamics (M or N) dominated the behavior, solely by observing \\\\( X(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed endpoint \\\\( X(s) \\\\) results from the collective effect of both M and N. Without additional information about the nature and timing of the interventions, it is not possible to distinguish the relative contributions of M and N from the final state alone. The interaction effects between transformations are not separable purely from endpoint observations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
