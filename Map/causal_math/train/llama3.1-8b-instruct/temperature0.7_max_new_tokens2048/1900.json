  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax^2 + Bx + C \\\\), where A, B, and C are constants. We explore the system's behavior with the initial condition \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\) and a transformation defined by \\\\( f(x) = Dxe^{Et} \\\\), where D and E are constants.\n\nUsing only the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we indicate precisely which transformations and interventions (either \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformation sequences can potentially result in the same \\\\( x(T) \\\\), especially in a nonlinear system where responses might not be uniquely invertible. The ambiguity in transformation types and their timing prevents definitive conclusions about the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
