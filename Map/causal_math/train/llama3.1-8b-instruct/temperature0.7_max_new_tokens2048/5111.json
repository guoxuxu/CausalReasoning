  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, and it evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. Analyze the scenario where a Laplace transform, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(s)) \\\\), is applied, modifying the system's behaviour.\n\nIf an intervention, represented by another transform \\\\( g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(z(s)) \\\\) (inverse Laplace transform), is applied at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the initial function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the system state yet again, reintroducing components or properties removed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Consequently, the final output at time \\\\( T \\\\) is a product of both the original transform and the inversion, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
