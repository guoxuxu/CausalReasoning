  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) defined over time, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We investigate the role of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), representing an integral transformation.\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial transformations (whether Laplace, Fourier, or both) applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), solely by observing the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be achieved via various pathways involving different transformations and their parameters. The overlapping effects and non-trivial relationship between different transformations make it challenging to precisely backtrack the intervention sequence or nature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
