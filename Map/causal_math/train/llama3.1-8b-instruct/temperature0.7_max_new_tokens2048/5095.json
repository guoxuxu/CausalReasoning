  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit comprising an inductor \\(L\\), capacitor \\(C\\), and resistor \\(R\\), governing the charge \\(Q\\) on the capacitor. The dynamics of \\(Q\\) are described by the second-order differential equation \\(L \\ddot{Q} + R \\dot{Q} + \\frac{Q}{C} = 0\\). We examine the effect of a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) introduced into the circuit at different times.\n\nIf an abrupt change in resistance \\(R\\) to a new value \\(R'\\) occurs at time \\(t = t_1\\), does the future behavior of \\(Q(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) depend only on the new resistance \\(R'\\) and not on the initial \\(R\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system’s future behavior depends not just on the instantaneous resistance \\(R'\\) but also on past charge and current conditions, maintained through \\(Q\\) and \\(\\dot{Q}\\) at \\(t_1\\), which in turn are influenced by the earlier resistance \\(R\\), inductor \\(L\\), and capacitor \\(C\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
