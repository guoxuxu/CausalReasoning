  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with conductivity k. An initial heating pattern v(x) is applied as an initial condition and after a time period, a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x,t)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) is a heating function, is introduced.\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution u(x,T), can we accurately determine the initial heating pattern and whether any intervention h(x,t) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The same final temperature distribution u(x,T) could arise from different initial conditions v(x) combined with different forms or absences of the intervention h(x,t). The intrinsic nature of the heat equation and possible functions h(x,t) create multiple possible combinations leading to the same endpoint, preventing unique determination of v(x) and h(x,t) solely from u(x,T).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
