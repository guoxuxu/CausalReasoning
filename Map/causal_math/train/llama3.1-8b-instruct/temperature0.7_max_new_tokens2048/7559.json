  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We study the impact of a transformation performed by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( j(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) (where P is a constant complex matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of N and only rely on M and P?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( j(z) \\\\) introduces another complex transformation, with the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depending on M, N, and P. The pathway and final state can be altered by each matrix's impact and how their exponentials combine, influence each other, and evolve the state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
