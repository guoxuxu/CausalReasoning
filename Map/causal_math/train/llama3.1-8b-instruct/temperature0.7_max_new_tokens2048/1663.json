  "Problem": "In a controlled environment, the complex function \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) is implemented in a system, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a time-parameterized linear function given by \\\\( w = at + bi \\\\), with constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The system's output \\\\( z \\\\) is analyzed before and after the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a fixed time.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within \\\\( 0 \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), an external intervention modifies \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w' = ct + di \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are constants), will the transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) now depend solely on the new parameters \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards?",
  "Explanation": "Although the intervention adjusts the parameters influencing \\\\( z \\\\), the transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) encompasses the behavior of the system from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\), including the interval before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influenced by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Hence, the output depends on both sets of parameters, not solely on \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
