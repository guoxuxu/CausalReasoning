  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the scenario where the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is applied, with N also being a complex matrix.\n\nCan we precisely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if and how \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, determining the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous. The transformation \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) could have changed the starting point in a non-trivial way correlated with the dynamics governed by M, and reversing that effect without precise knowledge of N's impact is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
