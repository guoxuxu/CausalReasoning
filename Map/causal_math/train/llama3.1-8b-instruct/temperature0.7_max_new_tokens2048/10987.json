  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy\\\\), with A and C being constant matrices. Consider the effect of the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is a constant complex matrix.\n\nSuppose at some instant \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention. Will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) but not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reliant on the initial effects from \\\\( B \\\\), the interim dynamics governed by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), and the additional influence from \\\\( D \\\\). These transformations alter the system's trajectory, influencing the final state in potentially non-trivial ways.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
