  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where A is a real constant and x is a complex initial state. Consider the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to \\\\( T \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional time-varying factor \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) is applied as an intervention to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during its transformation, resulting in \\\\( z'(t) = e^{iCt}z(t) \\\\), will the resultant Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z'(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) reflect effects dependent solely on the new factor \\\\( C \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modulates \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the resulting \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) reflects dependencies on the compounded frequencies \\\\( A + C \\\\) and the initial state \\\\( x \\\\). Thus, the Fourier transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) depends on both the altered frequency and the characteristics of \\\\( x \\\\), influenced by both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",
