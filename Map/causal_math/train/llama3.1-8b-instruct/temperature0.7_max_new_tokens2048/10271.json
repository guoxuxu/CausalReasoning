  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) is applied and then \\\\(z\\\\) evolves according to the dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex number acting as a constant multiplier.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is another complex number is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\) introduces an additional complexity to the evolution, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). The effect of \\\\( e^{Cz} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), compounded with the ongoing influence of \\\\( A \\\\), collectively determines the final observed state, thus not solely reliant on \\\\( A \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
