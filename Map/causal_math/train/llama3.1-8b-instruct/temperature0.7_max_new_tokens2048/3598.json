  "Problem": "Examine a convolution integral system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} x(\\\\tau) h(t-\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response, a known function. Changes are made to the input signal via transformation \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\), with a being a constant.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can one determine if the input was \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\) without knowing the exact transformation applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied, and without additional data or constraints, it’s impossible to uniquely infer the form of the input only from the final output due to potential variations in initial adjustments by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
