  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t governed by a set of linear differential equations in a matrix form \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) with M being a constant matrix. We evaluate how an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation, say Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on M, independent of the initial Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Fourier transform introduces a further modification to the system's state which impacts how \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolves. Both the initial Laplace and subsequent Fourier transforms shape the system’s progress by changing its representation in the frequency domain and affecting how the system is reverted to the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
