  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a complex oscillation on the unit circle in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined for any function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function at \\\\( s = i \\\\omega \\\\), can we unequivocally determine that the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform at a specific complex frequency does not uniquely identify a function due to potential contribution from other functions sharing the same transformation characteristics at that frequency. Additional conditions or information about the function's behavior, like initial conditions or boundedness, are required for unique identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
