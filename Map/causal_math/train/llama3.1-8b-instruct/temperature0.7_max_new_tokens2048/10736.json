  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are complex numbers. We analyze the behavior of this function under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = g(z) + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the functional form at any point \\\\( h(z) \\\\), and knowing the intervention was either \\\\( c \\\\) or \\\\( d \\\\) but not both, can we determine which constant was used?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which intervention was used based solely on the endpoint function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is challenging without additional information, as multiple configurations of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) might yield similar alterations in the function, making it impossible to distinguish them based purely on the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
