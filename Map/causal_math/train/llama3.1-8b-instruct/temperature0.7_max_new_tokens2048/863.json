  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( x, y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function. We apply the Laplace transform to the function, which changes its domain from time-domain to frequency-domain, represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf we modify \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) at a specific moment to include a dependency on \\\\( y \\\\) through a function \\\\( g(y) \\\\) and then apply the Laplace transform, would \\\\( F(s) \\\\) only reflect changes corresponding to \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by including \\\\( g(y) \\\\) introduces a new dependency. The resulting Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will thus reflect changes associated with both \\\\( x \\\\) and newly included changes from \\\\( y \\\\), depending on the nature of \\\\( g(y) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Modifying f(x, y) to include a dependency on y through g(y) and applying the Laplace transform will result in F(s) reflecting changes corresponding to both x and y."
