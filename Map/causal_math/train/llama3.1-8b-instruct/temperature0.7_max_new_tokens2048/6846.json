  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, D are constants. The system is subjected to a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing a frequency.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "As the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) affects the phase of the initial state, without knowledge of this application, one cannot accurately trace back to determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The rotation in the complex plane induced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) may result in multiple potential initial states that could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
