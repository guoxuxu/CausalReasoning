  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}x\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex square matrix, and \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex initial vector. We explore transformations with the operation \\\\(f(z) = Cz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is observed over time, and the consequences of an intervention through function \\\\(f\\\\) are analyzed.\n\nWithout interventions and given the position \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can one conclusively trace back to confirm if any transformation by \\\\(C\\\\) was applied to the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, \\\\(z(T)\\\\) results purely from the action of \\\\(e^{At}z_0\\\\), independent of \\\\(C\\\\). Knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) on its own does not provide any information about whether \\\\(C\\\\) was used at the initial stage, because it was not part of the evolution process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
