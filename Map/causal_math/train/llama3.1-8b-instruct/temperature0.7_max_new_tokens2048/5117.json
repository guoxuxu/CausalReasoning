  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we explore the response of a vector function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex plane under the effect of a linear operator L and an integral transformation \\\\( T(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\). Assume L is a matrix and s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf the operator L is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\), and the system is then observed using the transformation T without any intervention, will the transformed output T(s) be affected exclusively by L?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator L directly modifies \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\), thus changing the function to \\\\( Lz_0(t) \\\\). The integral transformation T computed subsequently will reflect this change, as T(s) essentially captures the Laplace transform of the new function \\\\( Lz_0(t) \\\\). The result is directly influenced by L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
