  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) on the complex plane, and we are studying its transformation through a complex contour integral \\\\(I(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u(z) dz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple, closed contour and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\(I(t)\\\\) for some fixed \\\\(t\\\\), can we uniquely determine the original power \\\\(k\\\\) in \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) without knowing any other contextual information?",
  "Explanation": "Simply knowing the result of \\\\(I(t)\\\\) is not sufficient to accurately pinpoint \\\\(k\\\\), as various factors including the path of integration and the complex nature of the exponents can result in similar outcomes for different values of \\\\(k\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
