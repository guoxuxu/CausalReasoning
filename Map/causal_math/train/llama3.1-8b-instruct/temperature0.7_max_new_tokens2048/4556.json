  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, and analyze its behavior under the integral transform \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i \\\\eta \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nHaving known the outcome of the transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) after the modification, can we ascertain if \\\\( a \\\\) was added, relying solely on the transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific modification (the addition of \\\\( a \\\\) to the exponent) solely based on the transform result is challenging due to potential equivalences in the integral results through different configurations of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( a \\\\), and \\\\( s \\\\). The transformed output may be similarly influenced by various changes in the input function parameters, causing ambiguity in back-calculating the specific intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → z(t); s → T[z(t)]; T[z(t)] → outcome of transform; ω → s; ω → z(t); σ → s; σ → T[z(t)]; σ → outcome of transform; η → s; η → T[z(t)]; η → outcome of transform; a → z(t); a → outcome of transform"
