  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) and let \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform over the spatial variables, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t) \\), on the solution's behavior.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t) \\\\) is computed for the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) and no other changes are made to the system, does this affect the solution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for some later time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition is an alternative representation of the data and does not change the physical state or behavior of the solution under the heat equation. The evolution of \\\\( u \\\\) remains solely determined by the initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and the characteristics of the heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
