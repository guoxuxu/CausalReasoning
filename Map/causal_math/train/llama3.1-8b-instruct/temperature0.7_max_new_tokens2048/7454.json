  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) on a function \\\\( w \\\\) in the complex plane over time t. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) after time T, is it possible to deduce whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) was applied to the initial state \\\\( w_0 \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) and only observing the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\), the initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined. The effect of the complex exponential transformation in the initial phase could mask or modify any changes in a manner indistinguishable from effects solely due to the matrix A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
