  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds\\\\). We investigate how the results of further transformations and initial conditions evolve through the system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new operation \\\\(G(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-s} z(s) ds\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the system's state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the natural evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\) and not on \\\\(T\\\\) or \\\\(G\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\(G(z)\\\\) introduces an additional modification, impacting the system's trajectory alongside the initial transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\). Both the nature of \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(G\\\\) transformations, which incorporate integral manipulations with distinctive kernel functions (exponential growth and decay respectively), contribute to the final state at \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
