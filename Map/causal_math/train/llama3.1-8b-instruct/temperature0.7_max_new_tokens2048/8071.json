  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) that maps real numbers x, y into the complex plane. The function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\), where A and B are fixed complex numbers. We are interested in examining the effects of applying a Laplace transform to x and a Fourier transform to y, and how these transformations influence the calculation of an integral over a defined region.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by modifying the coefficients A and B to A' and B' halfway through the calculation, will the integral still depend solely on the original A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Changing A and B to A' and B' modifies the function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) dynamically, affecting the exponential terms and therefore the resultant of the transformations and the final integral. The outcome is dependent on both sets of coefficients.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
