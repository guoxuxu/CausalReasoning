  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( t_1 < t \\\\), does this change the initial conditions set by the previous value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) for computing \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) affects the function only from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards, and thus the integral from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) remains unchanged. The overall effect at \\\\( t \\\\) will reflect a piecewise function combining both frequency behaviors, but the initial conditions (from 0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) remain dictated by the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
