  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of integral transformations on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-tx} f(x) dx \\\\), followed by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\). We examine the effects and causal sequences related to combining and modifying these transformations.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( k(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-ux} h(x) dx \\\\) is applied as an intervention after reaching \\\\( g(x) \\\\), is the eventual output \\\\( k(x) \\\\) independent of the initial transformation from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the transformation \\\\( k(x) \\\\) after transforming to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) increases the complexity and dependency on each step of the process. The output \\\\( k(x) \\\\) is affected not only by the intervention \\\\( k \\\\) but also by the prior transformations, as each step potentially alters the function's characteristics and the output's dependency on x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
