  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of this transformation in the context of the Laplace transform, defined as \\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention is applied where \\( f(z) \\) is replaced at a certain point \\( t_1 \\) with \\( g(z) = e^{-iz} \\), will \\( F(s) \\) from \\( t=0 \\) to \\( \\\\infty \\) still be influenced by the initial \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\) applied before \\( t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(z) = e^{-iz} \\) modifies the function post-\\( t_1 \\), but the effects of the initial \\( e^{iz} \\) on the segment from \\( t=0 \\) to \\( t_1 \\) still affect the overall Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\). The transformation introduces a discontinuity at \\( t_1 \\) that impacts both segments of the integration in \\( F(s) \\), thereby influencing the entire transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
