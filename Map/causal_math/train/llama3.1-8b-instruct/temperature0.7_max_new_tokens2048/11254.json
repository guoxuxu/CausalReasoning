  "Problem": "We explore a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions represented by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant real matrices. We investigate the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( L{z(t)} = F(s) \\\\) on z(t).\n\nAssuming the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved according to its differential equations and then transformed, can the original differential equations for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Laplace transform recovers \\\\( z(t) \\\\), knowing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone isn't sufficient to uniquely separate and identify the original differential equations governing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) since these are embedded in the combined function and may require additional boundary or initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
