  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(s) ds \\\\), with the kernel transformation \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-st} \\\\). We explore the impact of a modifying function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the system over the variable t.\n\nCan we decisively determine which interventions (\\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the information given by \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of multiple transformations (both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and their combined effect with the kernel) obfuscate the direct lineage back to specific interventions. Different combinations of modifications can potentially yield similar or indistinguishable outcomes, thus preventing exact backward inference of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
