  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistance R in series with an inductance L and a varying voltage source V(t). The voltage and current relationship is given by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI\\\\), where I is the current through the circuit.\n\nCan we deduce the original voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing I(t) at t = T without knowing the history of voltage changes?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the changes in V(t), particularly if the voltage was switched at some point, the current I(t) alone at time T cannot uniquely determine the initial conditions like \\\\(V_0\\\\) due to possible different scenarios leading to the same I(T).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
