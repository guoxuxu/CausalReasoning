  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time linear system controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Consider the application of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nx} \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, and study its effects over time.\n\nIf an intervention via a function \\\\( k(x) = e^{Qx}x \\\\) (where Q is a constant matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend solely on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(x) \\\\) adds an additional layer of complexity. The state trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward will depend on the effects of M, N, and now Q, especially how these matrices influence the system dynamics through their respective transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
