  "Problem": "Let's consider the probability density function \\( p(z) \\) that describes the distribution of a random variable \\( Z \\) undergoing the Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(z)e^{-i\\omega z} dz \\). We investigate how transformations in the time domain and frequency domain affect this PDF.\n\nGiven \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) = e^{-i\\omega a}\\hat{p}(\\omega) \\), can we deduce the value of \\( a \\) properly without knowing the form of \\( p(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the value of \\( a \\) uniquely from \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) \\) requires knowledge about the baseline function \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) \\). Without knowing \\( p(z) \\), multiple values of \\( a \\) could theoretically correspond to the observed changes in \\( \\hat{q}(\\omega) \\), precluding accurate back-calculation of \\( a \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
