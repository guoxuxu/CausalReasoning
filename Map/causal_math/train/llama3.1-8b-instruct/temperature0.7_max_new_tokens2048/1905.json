  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) that maps complex numbers to other complex numbers defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We analyze the behavior of this function under different transformations and the inversion through the integral transformation \\\\( W(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-uz} w(z) \\\\, dz \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is defined for a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without further modifications, and then we apply the integral transformation, will \\\\( W(u) \\\\) provide a transformed function equal to applying the integral transformation directly to \\\\( e^{Az_0} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( W(u) \\\\) applied directly after the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) treats the exponential component uniformly regardless of the initial parameter \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The linearity of the integral with respect to its integrand maintains the same transformed result as applying it directly to \\\\( e^{Az_0} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
