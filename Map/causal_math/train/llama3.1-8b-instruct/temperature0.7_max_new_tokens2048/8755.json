  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We analyze how this function transforms the input \\\\( z \\\\) over iterative applications, particularly under the Mandelbrot set conditions.\n\nIf during iterations a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z/(1 + |z|^2) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final behavior of the sequence be unaffected by this change?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) directly modifies the iteration dynamics by potentially stabilizing or otherwise altering the escalation of magnitude in z that would typically be indicative of divergence in the Mandelbrot setting. This transformation can change the convergence behavior dramatically.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
