  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and this function is applied in a complex analysis setting. We explore the role of a contour integral transformation of this function over a closed path in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing that an intervention altered the contour path during integration and the resultant integral value is non-zero, can we deduce that the new path encloses at least one additional singularity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is entire and contains no singularities, a non-zero integral despite the function's nature suggests a calculation error or a misunderstanding of the contour's relation to singularity enclosures, as no singularities exist for this function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Intervention on contour path → Change in integral value; Change in integral value → Presence of additional singularity"
