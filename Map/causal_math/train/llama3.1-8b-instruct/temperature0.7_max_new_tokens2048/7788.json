  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex constant, on the evolution and behavior of this system.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions (like \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or neither) were applied, based solely on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping impacts of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\), which integrate the evolving state under different complex exponentials, can yield similar endpoints for different sets and orders of applied transformations. This creates ambiguity in unraveling the exact nature or sequence of interventions from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
