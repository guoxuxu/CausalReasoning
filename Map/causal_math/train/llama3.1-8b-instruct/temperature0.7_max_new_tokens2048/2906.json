  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system where the growth rate is governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + R(t)\\\\), where A is a linear operator and R(t) is a time-dependent function incorporating environmental factors. We analyze the impact of a control transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) applied at a deterministic time interval.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing that no intervention was applied but not whether R(t) influenced the system, can we distinctly attribute the state at T solely to the operator A?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the contribution of R(t), we cannot solely attribute the state at T only to A, as R(t) could substantially alter the path and final state, independent of the linear term A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
