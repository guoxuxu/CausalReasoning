  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a product's inventory is driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant decay rate describing how quickly items are sold or perish. We study the behavior when applying the function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\), a sales strategy intended to reduce prices as inventory decreases, thereby potentially influencing sales rate.\n\nGiven the observed inventory level \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine which transformations (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied during the period, based only on the knowledge of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions used throughout the period, from only the observation of \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is challenging due to the complex interplay between the transformations and their nonlinear effects on the inventory trajectory. Different combinations can lead to similar end states, making exact attribution difficult.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
