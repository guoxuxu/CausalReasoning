  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, and the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transform, and then the inverse transform is applied without any modification, does this process change the final form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t?",
  "Explanation": "The process of taking a Laplace transform followed by an inverse transform theoretically returns the function to its original form, assuming no information is lost and all conditions for the Laplace transform and its inverse are properly met. Here, both operations are linear and should perfectly reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
