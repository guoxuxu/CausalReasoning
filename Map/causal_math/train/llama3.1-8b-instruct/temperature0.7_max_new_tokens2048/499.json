  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is a solution, then we apply a transformation by adding a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) where \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) and examine changes in the boundary behavior.\n\nIf a correction function \\\\(h(z, t) = e^{kt}g(z)\\\\), which depends on time t and a constant k, is applied to the system at time t = 1, will the boundary behavior of \\\\(u\\\\) at a later time t = T exclusively depend on k?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of \\\\(h(z, t)\\\\) on \\\\(u\\\\) is not confined to the scaling factor k but also on how the function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) and its interaction with \\\\(u\\\\) evolve over time. The new boundary behavior at t = T depends on both the nature of \\\\(g\\\\) and the parameter k.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of k directly influences the correction function h(z, t), which in turn affects the solution u, and therefore, the boundary behavior of u at a later time t = T is influenced by k."
