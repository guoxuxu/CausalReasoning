  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a complex-valued function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) is applied to a complex variable z in the domain of holomorphic functions, where A is a constant complex matrix. The system is further evolved by the transformation \\\\(g(z, t) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) with B also a constant complex matrix over time t.\n\nIf the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) in the complex plane is observed without any known interventions, is it possible to conclusively determine the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether transformations were applied as \\\\(g(f(z), T)\\\\) or \\\\(f(g(z, T))\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The uncertainty in transformation order and the non-commutative nature of complex exponential matrix functions inhibit retroactively deducing the exact initial state or transformation order. Both paths might converge to similar states or diverge based on matrix properties, thus blurring cause-effect relations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
