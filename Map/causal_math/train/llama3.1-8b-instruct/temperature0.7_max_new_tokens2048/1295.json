  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nIf an additional operator M, such that \\( Mu = e^{Ax}u \\) where A is a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at time t_1, will the ultimate form of \\( u(T) \\), for T > t_1, depend only on the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a new operator M as an intervention introduces exponential growth terms determined by A along with the differential properties of L, configuring both growth and diffusion components into \\( u(T) \\). Thus, the outcome at T > t_1 now reflects the interplay and combined effect of L and M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
