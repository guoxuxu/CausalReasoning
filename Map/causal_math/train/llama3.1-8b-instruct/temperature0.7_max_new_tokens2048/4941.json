  "Problem": "Investigate the response function R(z) in a complex system, where \\\\( R(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), with complex coefficients a and b. The system's behavior is probed using a transformation \\\\( T(s) = e^{st} \\\\) where s is a complex number and t represents time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(s) \\\\) is applied at t = 0, resulting in \\\\( R(T(s)) = R(e^{st}) \\\\), and then the response function is evaluated over time without further intervention, will the characteristics of \\\\( R(e^{st}) \\\\) at any time t be fundamentally different from \\\\( R(z) \\\\) at z = 1?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(s) \\\\) alters the input to the response function, shifting it from z = 1 to z = e^{st}, a trajectory dependent on the value of s. Since the transformation changes the point at which R is evaluated, the behaviors and attributes (poles and zeros) of \\\\( R(e^{st}) \\\\) can differ significantly from \\\\( R(z) \\\\) at z = 1 due to the exponential nature of the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
