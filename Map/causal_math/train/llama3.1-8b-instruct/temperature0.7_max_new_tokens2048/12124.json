  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over time t obeys the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. Assume further that a transformation \\\\(g(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u(x,t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant, is applied to study the temperature decay due to radiative loss.\n\nIf \\\\(g(u)\\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) and allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) was directly subjected to the heat equation to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(u)\\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling it by \\\\(e^{-\\lambda t}\\\\), which decays exponentially over time. This transformation changes the initial state, leading to a different temperature distribution at any time T compared to unmodified evolution under the heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
