  "Problem": "Consider the environment described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(w) = Aw + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants, on the evolution of this function over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\( T(w) \\\\), \\\\( U(w) \\\\), or both) and their parameters were used only by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of A, B, D, E, and even different intervention timings could potentially lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The nature of complex transformations and their non-trivial interaction with the dynamic function \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) create ambiguities in recovering the exact sequence and parameters of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
