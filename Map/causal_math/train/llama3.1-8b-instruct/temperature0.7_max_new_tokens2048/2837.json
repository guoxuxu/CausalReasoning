  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nIf \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any given \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation and the system's equation is linear and time-invariant, so the evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the subsequent transformation by \\\\( F(x) \\\\) commute. Thus, \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) remains unaffected by the order of operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
