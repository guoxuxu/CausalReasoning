  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function transforms according to another complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). The system's development is examined over time under the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and the results are compared to an untransformed approach.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the natural evolution and not on the transformations applied at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) or \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t_1) + 1 \\\\) as an intervention alters the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and therefore the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) also depends on the initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as well as on the latter applied transformation. Both transformations influence the final state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
