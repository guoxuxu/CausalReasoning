  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nGiven the spectrum resulting from the Fourier Transform of a function, can we infer the exact time-domain representation of the signal specifically determined whether the signal was \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), assuming no prior information on phase or amplitude modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform provides the frequency components and their magnitudes but losses specific phase information unless specifically preserved. Multiple time-domain signals could have the same magnitude spectrum, making it impossible to uniquely determine the function \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without additional phase information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
