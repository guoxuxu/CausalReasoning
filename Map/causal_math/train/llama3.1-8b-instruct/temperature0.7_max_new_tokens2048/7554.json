  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) describes a complex-valued signal, and the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is used to analyze the system's frequency domain properties. The signal is transformed using a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) at time t = T, can we determine whether the signal was originally transformed using \\\\(f(z)\\\\) without further information about the initial parameters of \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The characteristics of the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) could be similar due to inherent properties of \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) even without transformation, or they could result from the modulation effect of \\\\(f(z)\\\\). Without explicit knowledge of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or the original signal, distinguishing the exact cause from the observed effect is not possible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
