  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane function defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{f(z)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) and a, b, c are complex numbers. Investigate the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = dz + e \\\\) on z, where d and e are also complex numbers, on the mapping of the function w.\n\nAfter observing the outcome of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at some point, can we uniquely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The nonlinear interaction between the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) and the complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in the exponential makes it impossible to disentangle and uniquely declare the sequence or type of transformations applied merely based on the outcome. The overlapping effects and potential to reach the same outcome via different transformation paths contribute to this complexity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
