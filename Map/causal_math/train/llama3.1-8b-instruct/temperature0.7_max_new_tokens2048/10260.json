  "Problem": "Evaluate the influence of a complex transformation defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) on the stability of solutions to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\), can we distinctly determine whether the initial transformation \\\\( z(w_0) \\\\) or the later intervention \\\\( h(w(t_1)) \\\\) was applied, by only knowing the value of \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex function transformations and non-linear interaction mean that similar endpoint states \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\) could result from various combinations of initial conditions and interventions. The ambiguity and overlap in potential effects and states of the system ensure that multiple causal pathways could yield indistinguishable results at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(w_0) → z(w(T)); z(w_0) → w(T); k → w(T); w(t_1) → w(T); h(w(t_1)) → w(T); h(w(t_1)) → z(w(T)); k → z(w(T)); z(w(T)) → h(w(t_1); z(w(T)) → h(w(t_1)) is redundant and removed"
