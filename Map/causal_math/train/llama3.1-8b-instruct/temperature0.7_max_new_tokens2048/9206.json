  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), with M being a linear operator. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), applied to the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\), transforming it into the s-domain.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( X(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing the specific transformations applied during the trajectory evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( X(s) = (sI - M)^{-1}x_0 \\\\) and if M and \\\\( X(s) \\\\) are known, it is possible to uniquely solve for \\\\( x_0 \\\\) because the Laplace transform and the linear operator \\\\( M \\\\) provide sufficient information to retrieve \\\\( x_0 \\\\) by inverting the transformation, assuming \\\\( sI - M \\\\) is invertible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
