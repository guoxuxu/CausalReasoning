  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the time-dependent differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in testing the effects of applying a complex integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nIf we know the state of the system \\\\( z(T') \\\\) at some T' > T, is it possible to determine whether an intervention by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both was applied based on the value of \\\\( z(T') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of interventions and natural system evolutions can yield the same final state \\\\( z(T') \\\\). The interactions between the transformations \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and their integration effect obscure a clear path to deducing exactly which transformations, if any, were applied.",
