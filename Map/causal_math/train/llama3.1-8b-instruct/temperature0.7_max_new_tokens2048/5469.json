  "Problem": "Analyze causal behavior in a system undergoing Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Scenario dives into whether the performance and predictions of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems governed by convolution integrals \\\\( (f * g)(t) = \\\\int_0^t f(\\\\tau) g(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) can be inferred or influenced by certain transformation functions.\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a function describing a signal and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is the impulse response of an LTI system, and the Laplace transformations of both are computed without any other interference, can we predict the system's output \\\\( y(t) = (f * g)(t) \\\\) only by using these transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem for the Laplace transform states that the Laplace transform of the output signal of an LTI system (the convolution of input signal and impulse response) is equal to the product of their individual Laplace transforms. Thus, knowing the transformations, we can compute \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\) to find \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\\\) and predict \\\\( y(t) \\\\) by inverse transforming.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
