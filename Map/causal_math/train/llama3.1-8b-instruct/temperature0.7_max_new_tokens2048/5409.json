  "Problem": "Consider a vector field represented by the function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) affects the field over time z, where B is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) initially, and then allowed to evolve under the field without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly followed to t = T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state of the vector field by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{Bz_0} \\\\). The non-linear transformation introduced by \\\\( e^{Bz} \\\\) in the complex field changes the evolution trajectory differently than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were evolved without any transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
