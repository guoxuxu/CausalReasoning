  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\) on an interval \\\\([0, L]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(u(0,t) = 0\\\\) and \\\\(u(L, t) = 0\\\\). An external source \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is introduced, altering the initial condition to \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention in the form of an additional heating term, \\\\(g(x,t) = e^{kt}f(x)\\\\), is introduced at time \\\\(t_1 > 0\\\\), will the solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the subsequent boundary and initial conditions, independently of early state behavior before \\\\(t_1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modulates the heat distribution and adds complexity to the diffusion process. Accordingly, the state of the system at time T > t_1 becomes a product of both the additional term's influence from time \\\\(t_1\\\\) and the evolution of the system from the initial condition, thereby not isolated to the conditions post-\\\\(t_1\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
