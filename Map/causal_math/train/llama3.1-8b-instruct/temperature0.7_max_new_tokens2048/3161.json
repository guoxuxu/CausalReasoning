  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution along a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where k is a positive constant. We examine the effects of introducing a boundary condition modified at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\) over time t, such as \\\\( u(0,t) = u(0,t)e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( u_0(x)e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) evolved to t = T under \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the boundary condition alters the initial conditions at the boundary, influencing the solution of the heat equation across the domain. The exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) affects how the boundary condition evolves over time, leading to a different temperature distribution at any time T.",
