  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a vibrating string given by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the speed of the wave in the string and \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). An external forcing term \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is added to the system, resulting in a modified equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + F(x,t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the displacement \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at some later time T, can we conclusively determine the previous application sequence and form of force \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\), with the assumption that there was no other type of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple forcing functions could theoretically result in the same observed displacement at time T, due to the properties of the linear partial differential equation. Therefore, without more specific data (like full-time series data), we cannot uniquely determine the applied force history merely from a single time point observation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
