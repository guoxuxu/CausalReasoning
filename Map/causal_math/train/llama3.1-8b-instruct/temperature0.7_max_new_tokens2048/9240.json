  "Problem": "Investigate a system subjected to the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse, influencing a time-dependent function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially impacted by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) and analyzed for causality and effects of transformations.\n\nGiven the final observed Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we accurately identify the sequence of transformations (\\\\( t^2 \\\\) and/or \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), or both) applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by observing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after these interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapped nature of the transformations in the s-domain, different combinations of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) might yield congruent or similar Laplace transforms under certain conditions. Thus, identifying the exact sequence or type of transformations uniquely from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is infeasible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
