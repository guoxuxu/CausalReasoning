  "Problem": "Analyze the causal interactions in a system where a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time) undergoes a Laplace transform to generate complex function \\\\( Z(s) = U(s) + iV(s) \\\\). We study the effects and the capability to reverse this transformation.\n\nDoes applying a Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any intervention change the qualitative nature of the relationship between \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) in the complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operation that preserves the linear relationships between \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\). Therefore, the relationship in the complex plane (real and imaginary parts) is maintained in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
