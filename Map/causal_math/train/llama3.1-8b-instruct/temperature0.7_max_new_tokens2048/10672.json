  "Problem": "Investigate the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\) to a complex variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we ascertain the exact interventions and transformations (\\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) used only by observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is infeasible due to the complex number domain's inherent ambiguities and the non-commutative aspect of subsequent transformations and interventions. The overlapping effects and potential for various intervention sequences to lead to similar end states preclude a definitive tracing of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
