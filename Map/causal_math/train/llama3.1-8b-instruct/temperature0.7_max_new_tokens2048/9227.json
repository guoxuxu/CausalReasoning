  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with time evolution defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An operator transformation given by \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention.\n\nSuppose a second transformation \\\\( g(y) = Dy \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the system's evolution, will the state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the matrix A defining the time evolution or also on the matrices C and D?",
  "Explanation": "After applying \\\\( g(y) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the state becomes \\\\( Dy(t_1) \\\\), and the subsequent evolution modifies this state under \\\\( e^{A(T-t_1)} \\\\). Hence, the resulting \\\\( y(T) \\\\) depends on \\\\( C \\\\) (for \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) intervention), \\\\( D \\\\) (for \\\\( t_1 \\\\) intervention), and \\\\( A \\\\). Multiple interventions make the system’s final state influenced by all involved matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
