  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is a nonlinear function, representing a closed system. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t{e^{At}F(z) dt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint which transformations (\\\\( G(z) \\\\), \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or both) were employed by merely knowing the final state without additional system information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations, particularly their dependence on matrix exponentials \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{B(t-T)} \\\\), yield overlapping possible trajectories that can result in the same state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impractical to deduce precisely which transformations were operated based only on the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
