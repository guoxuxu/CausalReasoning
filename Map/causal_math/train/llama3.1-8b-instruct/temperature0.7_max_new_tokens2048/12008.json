  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of applying an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(h) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}h(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and T is a fixed time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = T \\\\) and then the integral transform \\\\( g(h) \\\\) is applied, will the result be the same as directly applying the transform to \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) without initially specifying the range?",
  "Explanation": "Specifying the range from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = T \\\\) before applying the integral transform confines the integration within these bounds. Applying the integral transform directly to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without this specification potentially considers a different domain for \\\\( z \\\\), affecting the output due to the changing limits of integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
