  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are looking at how integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, affect the function over time.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) is subjected to a Laplace transformation without any further modification, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) indicate the same frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) as the original complex function?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) is \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\), which clearly indicates the presence of the original frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as part of the transform's pole. Therefore, the frequency component is preserved through the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
