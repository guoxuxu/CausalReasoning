  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) models the energy states in a two-dimensional space depending on positions x and y. We explore the effect of a rotational transformation defined by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) applied to a vector \\\\( v = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( v \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\theta = \\\\pi/4 \\\\) and then the energy state \\\\( z \\\\) is calculated, will the energy state of the transformed vector be the same as if \\\\( v \\\\) was used directly to calculate \\\\( z \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) represents a rotation in the xy-plane, and since the energy function \\\\( z \\\\) depends only on the radius, not the angle (being purely a function of \\\\( x^2 + y^2 \\\\)), the calculated energy state remains unchanged by the rotation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
