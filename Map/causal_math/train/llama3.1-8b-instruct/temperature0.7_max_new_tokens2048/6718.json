  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the causal relationships when manipulating the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and analyzing its impact on the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using different transformations.\n\nOn observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a specific time point T and knowing it was generated without any modifications of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), can we accurately retrieve the exact form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) used from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alone, retrieving the specific form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) used to achieve it is generally not possible due to the loss of information through the integral and exponential operation, which compresses different possible \\\\( x(t) \\\\) functions into potentially identical outcomes in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
