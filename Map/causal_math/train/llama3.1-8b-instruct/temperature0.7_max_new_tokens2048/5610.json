  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a set of linear algebraic equations driven by a matrix function \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\), where A is a diagonalizable matrix. We further examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At}X(t) dt \\\\) on the system.\n\nIf \\\\( X(T) \\\\) is observed and known to result from an evolution described by \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( X_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(X) \\\\) was applied at any point?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the application of the transformation \\\\( g(X) \\\\), it is not feasible to reverse-engineer the exact initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) because the integral transformation can significantly modify the trajectory that \\\\( X(t) \\\\) would follow from any guessed \\\\( X_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
