  "Problem": "Consider a linear operation in a vector space described by the integral transform \\\\( H(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(t) x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a transformation function. We study the effect of applying a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined by \\\\( D[x(t)] = \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nIf the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then the integral transform \\\\( H \\\\) is computed, will \\\\( H(D[x(t)]) \\\\) at any given time be the same as \\\\( H(x(t)) \\\\) without the application of \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) changes the function to its derivative, which typically alters its behavior and values. Since \\\\( H \\\\) is an integral transform, differential changes in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will generally result in different output \\\\( H(D[x(t)]) \\\\), especially depending on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
