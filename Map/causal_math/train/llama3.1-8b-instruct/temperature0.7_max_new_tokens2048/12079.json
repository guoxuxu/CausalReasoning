  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the differential equations system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z represents a complex variable associated with time t. We analyze the system transformation under the integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i \\\\omega s} ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine definitively which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the information of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations based on the final state is challenging due to the potential cancellation and interaction effects of the exponential terms in \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). These transformations might produce similar states at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) through different paths, creating ambiguity in backtracking the exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
