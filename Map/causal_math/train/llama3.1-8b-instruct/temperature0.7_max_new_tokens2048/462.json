  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing an oscillatory system. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output, can we precisely deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t without knowing its initial form?",
  "Explanation": "The information in the Fourier transform is limited to frequency content and neglects phase information. Without additional specifications such as initial conditions or phase information, the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined just from \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Fourier transform F(z) does not allow us to precisely deduce the original function z(t) at any time t without knowing its initial form, because the inverse Fourier transform is required to recover the original function."
