  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex number constant. The analysis focuses on the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex number constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the specific interventions used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) be determined uniquely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from various combinations of transformation applications due to the properties and interaction of the complex exponential transformations involved. Thus, it is indeterminable which specific interventions were applied based solely on the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
