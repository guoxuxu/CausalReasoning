  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system's state is transformed by a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), which modifies the state into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( F^{-1}(\\\\hat{u}) = u \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the effects of the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the inverse Fourier transform as an intervention introduces a corrective modification, but the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) still depends on the initial application of \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and how these transforms interact with L. The altered state affects how the system evolves to time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
