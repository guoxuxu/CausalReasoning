  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered over time t, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by scaling the magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Therefore, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is different due to the exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), which scales the magnitude differently over time compared to the purely oscillatory behavior under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
