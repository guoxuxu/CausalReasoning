  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). This transformation is used in analyzing a system's behavior, where s is a complex variable. The function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) is subjected to a transformation where it is multiplied by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, resulting in a new function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}t^2 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by applying \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) without any further modifications, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) be the same as the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) fundamentally alters the function, resulting in a different Laplace transform due to the shift theorem which translates the s-domain. The transforms are \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{t^2\\\\}(s) = 2/s^3 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{at}t^2\\\\}(s) = 2/(s-a)^3 \\\\), clearly showing a difference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
