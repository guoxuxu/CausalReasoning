  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial vector of complex numbers. We explore how integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, influence the system's behavior.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) undergoes the Laplace transform and then evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) over time t, will the resultant state at time T be reliably predicted by the mathematical model without considering the inverse transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform alters the initial state in the frequency domain, and evolving this transformed state under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) will not yield the same time-domain behavior unless the inverse Laplace transform is applied to revert it back to the original domain. The evolution in complex function space will significantly deviate the trajectory and thus requires consideration of the inverse transformation to predict the original state's behavior accurately at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
