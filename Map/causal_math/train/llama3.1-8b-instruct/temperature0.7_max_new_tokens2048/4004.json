  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Lz\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\) defined by \\\\(z_T(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(t, s) z(s) ds\\\\) is applied to the system.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine which transformations (neither, either or both) were applied during the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) based on the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations and intrinsic dynamics, including no transformations at all. Both \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\) and \\\\(M(t, s)\\\\) could have overlapping effects that make it impossible to disentangle their contributions based solely on the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\). Different paths could lead to the same endpoint due to the integral nature of the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
