  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z \\) defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We study the effect of adding a linear transformation represented by \\( T(z) = az + b \\) (where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants) on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( T(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of application of \\( T(z) \\), the transformation could have shifted the phase or scaled the amplitude, which cannot be exactly determined or reversed without additional information about \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
