  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a vector space involving a matrix \\\\( P \\\\) representing a projection operator onto a subspace. Let us explore the changes in vectors under the operations defined by another matrix \\\\( Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is an orthogonal matrix representing a rotation.\n\nIf you observe a vector \\\\( w \\\\) after it has been transformed by possibly both \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\), can you uniquely determine the sequence of transformations (\\\\( P \\\\) then \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( Q \\\\) then \\\\( P \\\\)) that produced \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information, the final vector \\\\( w \\\\) does not carry enough information to uniquely determine the order of transformations. Both sequences could theoretically result in the same vector due to overlaps in the range and null spaces of the matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
