  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), and an external heat source function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) is introduced that affects the temperature. The impact of heat source transformation defined by \\\\( u(x,t) = u(x,t) + h(x,t) \\\\) on temperature distribution is analyzed.\n\nIf the heat source function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) is introduced to the system initially and no further modifications are made, will the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at T be the same as if the source \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) was not introduced at all?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the heat source function modifies the initial heating conditions and directly influences the temperature distribution over time, differentiating \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) from the scenario where \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) was not applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
