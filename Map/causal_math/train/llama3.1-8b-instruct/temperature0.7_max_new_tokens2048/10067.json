  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic model where the temperature of a system \\\\( T \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of an initial condition modification characterized by \\\\( T(x,0) = T_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a heat source distribution function.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an additional heat source \\\\( k(x) \\\\) is introduced, will the final temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the influence of the original heat source \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and not \\\\( k(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional heat source \\\\( k(x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the heat equation. Both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( k(x) \\\\) will influence the final temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\). The system's final state reflects the cumulative effect of both heat sources.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
