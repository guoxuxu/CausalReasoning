  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the dynamics of this function under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) precisely by only knowing the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) is concentrated at \\\\( s = w \\\\), manifested as a Dirac delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(s-w) \\\\). This specific feature allows for the precise determination of frequency \\\\( w \\\\) from the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
