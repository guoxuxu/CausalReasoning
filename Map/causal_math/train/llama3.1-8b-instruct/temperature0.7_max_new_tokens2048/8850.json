  "Problem": "Let's consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and u represents a control input. We'll explore how different integral transforms, specifically the Laplace Transform, affect our response to changes in control strategy depicted by \\\\( u(t) = V(t)x + W(t) \\\\), where V(t) and W(t) are time-varying matrices.\n\nKnowing the system's state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine the initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) without knowledge of the applied control strategy \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the control inputs \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and \\\\( W(t) \\\\), the transformations they impose on the state trajectories obscure the back-calculation to \\\\( x(0) \\\\). The control strategy potentially modifies the initial conditions and system evolution markedly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
