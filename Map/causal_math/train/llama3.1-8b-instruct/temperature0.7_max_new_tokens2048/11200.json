  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) and its original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). We are scrutinizing the influence of a linear operator \\\\( T \\\\) operating on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f(t)] = t \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter obtaining the result \\\\( L[U[T[f(t)]]] \\\\) at a certain value of \\\\( s \\\\), can we precisely deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the exact sequence of operations (\\\\( T \\\\) followed by \\\\( U \\\\), or vice versa) used?",
  "Explanation": "The same final transformed result could be achieved through differing sequences or types of operations due to the properties and overlap of operations in the transformation space. The specific nature of Laplace Transforms and the interplay between multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\) and exponential modification does not allow for a unique backward determination of sequence from the final transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
