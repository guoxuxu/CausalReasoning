  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform, having a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. This scenario explores causal inference in system responses by examining different excitation functions and their respective impacts.\n\nIf a step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied initially and an intervention modifies the transfer function to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still solely represent the response of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) initially described?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing the transfer function to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) alters how the system reacts to the input, regardless of the initial application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Consequently, the output from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) will reflect the properties of \\\\( G(s) \\\\), not just \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Initial transfer function H(s) → Initial output; Intervention at t1 → Modified transfer function G(s); Modified transfer function G(s) → Output at T > t1; Initial output → Output at T > t1"
