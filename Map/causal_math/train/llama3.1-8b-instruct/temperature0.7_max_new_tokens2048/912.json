  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process described by the integral transformation \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^s K(s, t) Y(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( Y(t) \\\\) is a Brownian motion process and \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) is a deterministic kernel function. We assess the impact of modifying the kernel function \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) through the transformation \\\\( K_{new}(s, t) = e^{At}K(s, t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant.\n\nConsidering the endpoint \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\), can we definitively determine which specific transformations \\( e^{At} \\) or \\( e^{Bt} \\) or both were applied throughout the interval [0, T] only by analyzing \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity of interactions between the kernel transformations and their influence on the Brownian motion results in multiple potential transformation scenarios yielding equivalent end states \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\). This ambiguity prevents precise determination of what transformations were actually applied just from \\\\( X_{new}(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
