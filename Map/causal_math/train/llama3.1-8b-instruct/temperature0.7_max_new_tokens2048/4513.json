  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\), where M represents a square matrix. We explore the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) at some initial condition and examine its impact on system dynamics.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is subsequently allowed to progress under \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T exactly correspond to evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the state of the system by transforming the function into its frequency components. The evolution of these components under \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\) can differ from the original time-domain evolution, thereby altering the state dynamically at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Fourier transform F(z) at t = 0 → z_0; z_0 → dz/dt; dz/dt → z(t); z(t) → Evolution from z_0 at t = T; dz/dt = Mz; M → dz/dt; z_0 → z(t); z(t) → z(t) at t = T"
