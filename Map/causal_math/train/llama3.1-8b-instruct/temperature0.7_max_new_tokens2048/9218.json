  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network where the voltage across a circuit element is governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( V(s) = H(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) represents the complex impedance of the element and \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is the transformed input current. The effect of an intervention by adding a parallel impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to the system is studied.\n\nFrom the observed transform-domain voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) at any point, can we uniquely determine the original transform-domain current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) when no additional impedance is added?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional modifications to the circuit such as added impedance, \\\\( V(s) \\\\) is directly related to \\\\( I(s) \\\\) by the invariant function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Hence, one can uniquely recover \\\\( I(s) \\\\) using the inverse of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), assuming \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is not zero or does not introduce ambiguities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
