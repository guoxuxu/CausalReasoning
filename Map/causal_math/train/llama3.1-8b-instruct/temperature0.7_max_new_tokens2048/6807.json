  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant representing angular frequency and K a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( R(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{ut}z(u)\\\\, du \\\\) (where \\\\( u \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( K \\\\), \\\\( s \\\\), or \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on all parameters, including \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( K \\\\), \\\\( s \\\\), and \\\\( u \\\\). Both \\\\( T(s) \\\\) and \\\\( R(u) \\\\) can significantly modify the trajectory and behavior of the function, influencing the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\). This dependence is due to the integration effects and the presence of complex exponentials.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
