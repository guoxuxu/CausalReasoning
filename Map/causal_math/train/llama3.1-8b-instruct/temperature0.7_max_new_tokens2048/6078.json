  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. We examine the impact of the Laplace transform on this function and how it influences the causal structure of the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nHaving known \\\\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From the expression \\\\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), the pole at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\) directly provides the unique value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\), effectively allowing deducing the original angular frequency from the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
