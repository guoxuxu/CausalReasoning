  "Problem": "Let’s analyze a complex dynamic system governed by a Cauchy problem involving Fourier transforms, defined by \\\\( u'(t) = A \\\\cdot \\mathcal{F}(u(t)) + B \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a function of time t, \\\\( A \\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nIf an intervention occurs at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with a modification \\\\( u(t_1) = u(t_1) + C \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant, will the system state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the modified dynamics post-intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new condition, but the system state at T will not depend solely on the post-intervention dynamics. The full history from \\\\( u_0 \\\\) through to the intervention impacts the system, and both the pre- and post-intervention dynamics lent by \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) influence the end state at \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
