  "Problem": "Consider a linear differential equation system described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(x) = P^{-1}e^{Qt}Px \\\\) over time t, where P and Q are constant matrices and \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential of Q.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( S(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used is not feasible solely from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to the complex interplay and potential commutative ambiguities of the matrix exponentials and basis transformations. Multiple intervention sequences could lead to the same endpoint, introducing inherent uncertainties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
