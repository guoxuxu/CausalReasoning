  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We assess the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{iBt} \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a real constant, and investigate how it influences the behavior over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under its own rule without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under its original rule?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) effectively changes the initial condition to \\\\( e^{iB0}x = x \\\\), and then it evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\). However, because \\\\( g(t) \\\\) applies a transformation at the initial state, it alters the trajectory to \\\\( e^{iA(t)}e^{iB0}x = e^{iA(t)}x \\\\) which is initially the same but conceptually distinct as a manipulated start, hence no direct intervention post-initial condition modifies the result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
