  "Problem": "Investigate the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\) to a complex variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nCan we infer the initial variable \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if we know \\\\( x(T) \\\\) without understanding whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Owing to the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\), which squares \\\\( x \\\\) and adds a complex constant, without knowing its application, any back calculation from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) lacks certainty. Multiple values of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) might correspond to the same \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to the non-injectiveness of the quadratic transformation in complex numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
