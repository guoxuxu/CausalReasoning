  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^4 + i \\\\cdot t^3 \\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation on this function over time t.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) such that a new term \\\\( +t^2 \\\\) is added creating \\\\( z'(t) = t^4 + i \\\\cdot t^3 + t^2 \\\\), will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) differ fundamentally (besides scale or shift transformations) from that of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the new term \\\\( +t^2 \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) introduces a different dynamic that will manifest itself in additional terms in the Laplace transformed equation. This alteration notably reflects not merely as a scale or shift but as a fundamental change in the transformed function's structure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
