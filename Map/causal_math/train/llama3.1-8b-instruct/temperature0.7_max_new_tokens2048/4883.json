  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, defining a rotation in the complex plane with time. Let's study the system under a transformation specified by the operator \\\\( L \\\\) taken as a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( F[\\\\cdot] \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t + \\\\theta} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a phase shift, will this alteration affect the Fourier spectrum observed at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a phase shift, altering the phase of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Although this does not change the location of the frequency components (still centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)), the phase information in the Fourier transform, represented in complex coefficients, is altered, hence affecting the Fourier spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
