  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the consequence of applying a forcing function \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, on the system's response over time t.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where another forcing function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-i\\\\omega't} \\\\) is introduced, will the final response of the system \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the natural frequency \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the introduction of another forcing function during the system's evolution, the response at T is affected by both the frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) of the respective forcing functions, as well as the system's natural frequency. Both forcing functions contribute to the superposition of responses, influencing the resultant motion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
