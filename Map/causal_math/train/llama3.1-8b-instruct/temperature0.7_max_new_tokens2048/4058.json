  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v\\\\cdot\\\\nabla u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the state of the system and \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant velocity vector. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) is studied to determine its effect over time.\n\nCan the original state \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) be deduced clearly from observing \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the Fourier transform, reverse engineering to \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) from \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\) could lead to multiple feasible initial states because the Fourier transformed and non-transformed paths could coincide by chance, depending on the nature of \\\\(v\\\\) and \\\\(u_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
