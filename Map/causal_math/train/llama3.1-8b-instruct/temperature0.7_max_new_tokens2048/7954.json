  "Problem": "Analyze causal inference in a system represented by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\lambda \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the system's state and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant speed. Additionally, consider the transformation \\\\( g(u) = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the information about the application of \\\\( g(u) = Lu \\\\), it's impossible to precisely backtrack to \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\). The transformation could have altered the initial condition, making causal inference between \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) and \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) ambiguous and dependent on knowledge of L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
