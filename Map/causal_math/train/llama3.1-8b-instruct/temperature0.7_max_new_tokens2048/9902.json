  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We will examine how changes in the time domain function affect its Laplace transform and vice versa, taking into account voluntary interventions in the form of derivative operations.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), can we deduce with absolute certainty whether a derivative operation was applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) before transformation, just from knowledge of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Just from \\\\( F(s) \\\\), without additional information about conditions or modifications applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) prior to transforming, it is impossible to uniquely determine whether derivatives were taken. Different functions and their derivatives can result in similar or even identical transforms under specific circumstances.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Derivative operation on f(t) → Shift in F(s) pole position; Shift in F(s) pole position → F(s) has a pole at s = 0; F(s) has a pole at s = 0 → f(t) is a step function; F(s) has a pole at s = 1 → f(t) is a constant; f(t) is a step function → Derivative operation was applied to f(t); f(t) is a constant → Derivative operation was applied to f(t)"
