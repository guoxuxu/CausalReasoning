  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u + f\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(f\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the force term \\\\(f\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(f)\\\\) is applied to the force term at the initial condition and then the system evolves according to the Navier-Stokes equations without further intervention, will the resulting velocity field \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at time T differ from if the original force \\\\(f\\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(f)\\\\) changes the spectral components of the external force, which directly affects the driving terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. This alteration modifies the whole dynamics of the velocity field over time, resulting in a different velocity field \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at any future time T compared to using untransformed \\\\(f\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
