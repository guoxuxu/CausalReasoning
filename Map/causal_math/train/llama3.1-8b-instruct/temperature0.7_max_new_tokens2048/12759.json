  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\), denoted \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\). We explore the implications of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( h(t) \\), whose transform is \\\\( H(s) \\), and its effect on the inverse transform \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the outcome of the convolution and a transformation operation, can we precisely identify the nature of the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( L(s) \\\\) applied, solely based on the final inverse transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the inverse transform, after interventions and modifications by \\\\( L(s) \\\\), cannot uniquely determine both the original function and the nature of the transformation. Multiple combinations of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( L(s) \\\\) could yield the same final result, causing ambiguity in causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
