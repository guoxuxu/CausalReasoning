  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a Hermitian matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is a fixed complex vector. The transformation evolves a quantum state in time t in a closed system.\n\nIf an initial quantum state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to time T without any external interference, does the evolved state at time T represent an orthogonal transformation from the initial state?",
  "Explanation": "Quantum mechanical evolution governed by a Hermitian matrix through the exponential operator \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) ensures unitarity. Thus, the magnitude and orthogonality relations in the quantum state space are preserved over time, depicting an orthogonal transformation from the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Hermitian property of A → A is unitary; e^(iAt) → A is unitary; A is unitary → A^(-1) exists; A^(-1) exists → e^(-iAt) exists; e^(iAt) → e^(-iAt); e^(iAt) → z(T); e^(-iAt) → z(0) = x_0; z(T) → orthogonality of z(T) and z(0)"
