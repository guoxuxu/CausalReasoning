  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions describing a physical system. We investigate a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency, applied to this system over time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both), merely from knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intertwining effects of the transformations \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) and \\( e^{i\\theta t} \\), along with the dynamic \\( \\lambda \\), contribute to a range of possible paths that could result in the same endpoint \\( z(T) \\). Disentangling these influences based on the endpoint alone is highly challenging without additional information on the sequence or parameters of applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
