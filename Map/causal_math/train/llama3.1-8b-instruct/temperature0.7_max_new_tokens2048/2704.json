  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature \\\\( T(x, t) \\\\) at a point \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency constant.\n\nCan we unequivocally determine the type and timing of interventions applied (\\\\( f(T) \\\\), \\\\( g(T) \\\\), or both) by observing only the final temperature distribution \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions and their timing could lead to similar temperature distributions due to the overlapping and blending effects of the transformations \\\\( f(T) \\\\) and \\\\( g(T) \\\\) on the heat diffusion process. The lack of unique determinability comes from the additive nature of these transformations and their potential to produce equivalent thermal outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
