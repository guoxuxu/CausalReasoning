  "Problem": "Consider the problem of heat distribution over a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion constant and u(x, t) represents the temperature. An integral transformation using the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the solution's behavior.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of an additional heat source described by another differential equation is applied at time t = t_1, will the Fourier-transformed solution at time T > t_1 solely depend on the original model parameters and initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "An intervention such as an additional heat source changes the system's state and, hence, the resulting solution's form. Both the original and the additional terms influence the Fourier-transformed solution, affecting the future distribution and evolution of heat on the rod.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
