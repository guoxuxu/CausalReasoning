  "Problem": "Consider a complex function Z, where Z(s) = integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) * cos(t) dt. We are exploring the impact of applying a Laplace transformation to this function and subsequent transformations defined by the operation G(Z) = 1/(s^2 + 1).\n\nBy observing G(Z) at a later time T without prior knowledge of whether L was immediately followed by G or if G was applied after some delay, can we infer the exact sequence of transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on the timing or additional transformations between L and G, it is impossible to determine if G was applied immediately after L or at a later stage just by examining G(Z). The properties of Laplace transformations and the specific form of G do not retain information about timing.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
