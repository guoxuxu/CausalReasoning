  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-dependent system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. An integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) is applied at some time t = t_1, will the final transformed function \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original PDE without considering the effect of G?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transformation \\\\( G(u) \\\\) modifies the state of the system by potentially altering the terms of the solution. The inverse Fourier components introduced by \\\\( G \\\\) will affect the evolution such that the final state at T cannot be described solely by the initial PDE variables and \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
