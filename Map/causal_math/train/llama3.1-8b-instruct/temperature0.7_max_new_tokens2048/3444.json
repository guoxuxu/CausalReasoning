  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in a two-dimensional plane over time t. The transformation defined by the integral \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied (whether s, r, or both), solely by knowing \\\\( w(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of s and r, especially due to the linearity and overlapping effects in integral transformations with exponential factors. Without additional information, it's impossible to determine precisely the sequence or values of transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
