  "Problem": "Analyze a system where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(F(y)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} y(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), giving a transformed function in the frequency domain. Consider effects of an inverse transformation and external modulation by a function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) applied at a specific time.\n\nIs it possible to determine specifically whether a modulation by \\\\(h(t)\\\\) occured at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\) just by examining the state of \\\\(y(T)\\\\) after applying the inverse Fourier Transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the inverse Fourier and the modulation impacts can be complexly intertwined in the resultant signal, and without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely attribute changes in \\\\(y(T)\\\\) to the modulation at \\\\(t_1\\\\) or to other possible alterations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
