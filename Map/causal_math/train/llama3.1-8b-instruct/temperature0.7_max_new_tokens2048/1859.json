  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We apply a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is a diagonal matrix representing an integral transform.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the dynamics induced by A and B, excluding any effects introduced by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) introduces additional dynamics that will modulate the outcomes, making the system's endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reliant not just on A and B, but significantly on how C and D interact with the initial conditions and each other.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
