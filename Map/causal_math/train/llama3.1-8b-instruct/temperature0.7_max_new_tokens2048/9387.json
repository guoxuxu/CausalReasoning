  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a diffusion constant. Evaluate how the Laplace transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), influences the behavior of the solution.\n\nIf at some time point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an external function based on Fourier transformation, say \\\\( h(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is introduced into the system as an intervention, does the final form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) rely solely on the diffusion constant \\\\( k \\\\) without influence from the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Fourier transform introduces additional dynamics into the system. The modifications in the system due to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), essentially altering the spatial component, means the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is influenced by both the diffusion constant and the nature of the Fourier-based intervention. This additional effect alters how the solution evolves and spreads over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
