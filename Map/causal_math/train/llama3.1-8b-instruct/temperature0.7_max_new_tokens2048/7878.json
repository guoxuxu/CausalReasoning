  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as the complex integral transform of a real function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number with a real part that ensures convergence. The causal relationship between function modifications and their effect on the integral transform output is explored.\n\nGiven the transform output \\\\( z(t) \\\\), if it demonstrates a specific exponential behavior characteristic of the added constant \\\\( c \\\\), can we conclude definitively that \\\\( x(t) \\\\) had \\\\( c \\\\) added to it?",
  "Explanation": "The specific exponential behavior observed in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result from different modifications to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) other than just adding a constant. Without additional information, it's not possible to uniquely attribute the alteration in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly to the addition of \\\\( c \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Multiple functions could yield the same or similar modifications in the transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
