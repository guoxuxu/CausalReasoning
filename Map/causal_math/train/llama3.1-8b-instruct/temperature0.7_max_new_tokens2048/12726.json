  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\), where A and B are constant scalars. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} ds \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_t^{t_1} e^{ux} du \\\\) is applied as intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 not incorporate effects of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) as an intervention significantly affects the path of the solution and incorporates it in the final state at T, alongside the compounded impact of the system parameters A and B. The dynamics of the system remain influenced by both the original parameters and the introduced transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
