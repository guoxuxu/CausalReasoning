  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Assume \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and x is a constant vector. Let the impact of an operational matrix B be scrutinized via the transformation \\\\( h(s) = B \\\\cdot g(s) \\\\) where B commutes with A.\n\nConsidering an additional operation by a constant matrix C on \\\\( h(s) \\\\) at a time during the transformation, resulting in \\\\( i(s) = C \\\\cdot h(s) \\\\), will \\\\( i(s) \\\\) solely depend on the products and orders of B and C?",
  "Explanation": "Given B and C are constant matrices and they interact linearly through the transformation, the resultant \\\\( i(s) \\\\) will indeed reflect the cumulative operations of B and C on the original transform. Since these matrices manipulate the transform linearly, their order and product determine \\\\( i(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
