  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) characterizing a process dependent on the variable x. We further explore how the transformations through application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by \\\\( L(z) = z'(x) \\\\), impact the outcomes when \\\\( z(x) \\\\) evolves under a complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 + i \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an intervention applies \\\\( L \\\\) at a point \\\\( x_1 \\\\), and then \\\\( z \\\\) is evaluated under \\\\( w \\\\) until \\\\( x_2 \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( z(x_2) \\\\) be solely determined by the initial function \\\\( z \\\\) regardless of the intervention by \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( L \\\\) changes the derivative, and thus the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) under transformation \\\\( w \\\\). Since the complex function and the linear operator can interact nonlinearly, the path of evolution post-intervention is contingent on both the original function and the nature of the applied intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
