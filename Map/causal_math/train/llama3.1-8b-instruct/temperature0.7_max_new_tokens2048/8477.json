  "Problem": "Consider a system functioning under a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\). The system is influenced by another function \\\\(g(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) applied either initially or during the operation, and the impact on the transform's outcome is analyzed.\n\nIf the system starts by applying \\\\(g(t)\\\\) to an initial condition \\\\(f(0)=0\\\\), followed by evolution without further interference, will the resulting transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)+g(t)\\\\}\\\\) at a later time T just be the transform of \\\\(g(t)\\\\), i.e., \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the initial condition of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is zero and evolves without other influences, the Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t)+g(t)\\\\) equals the transform of \\\\(g(t)\\\\). The sinusoidal input does not modify the inherent properties of the underlying function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) beyond its initial modification.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
