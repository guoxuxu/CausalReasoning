  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\), with M being a constant complex matrix. We analyze the change when applying a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iNt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), one cannot determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely since the transformation might have modified the initial conditions in a way that cannot be reversed merely from knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially when N does not commute with M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
