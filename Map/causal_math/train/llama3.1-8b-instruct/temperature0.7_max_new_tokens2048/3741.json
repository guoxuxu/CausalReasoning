  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z \\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is not applied and the system evolves from an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) = x(T) + iy(T) \\\\) at time T be solely dependent on the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Without applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) depends directly on the differential equations using A and B. Thus, the state at time T is determined solely by how these matrices drive the evolution of x and y over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
