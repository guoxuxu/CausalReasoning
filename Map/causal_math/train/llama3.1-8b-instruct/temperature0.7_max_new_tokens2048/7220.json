  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nKnowing the outcome \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(S(z)\\\\), or both) during the period, solely based on the final value?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) could potentially result from various combinations and applications of transformations \\\\(T(z)\\\\) and \\\\(S(z)\\\\). Different settings of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) might yield the same or indistinguishable outcomes, leading to ambiguity and impossibility in uniquely determining the specific transformations and parameters used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
