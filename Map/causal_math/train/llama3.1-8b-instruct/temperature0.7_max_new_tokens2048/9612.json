  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices, and x is an initial condition vector. We examine the influence of the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, during different interventions over time t.\n\nGiven the resulting Laplace transform after the intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\\\) where D was modified to E, can we determine if the original system was governed by D or E only based on the resulting Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system's inherent characteristics, and the resultant Laplace transform over all time will be an integration through both regimes governed by D and E. The overlap and combination of influences from each phase make it impossible to distinguish definitively, using just the transform output, whether initial or later governance was by D or E.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
