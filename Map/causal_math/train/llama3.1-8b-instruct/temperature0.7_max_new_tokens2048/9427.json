  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We investigate the causal relationships under transformations by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a non-zero integer.\n\nIf at some point x_1 > x_0 a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\), will the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T (where T > x_1) depend solely on the initial transformation and not on the new intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention modifies the system again, changing the trajectory to \\\\( z(x) = (e^{ikx})^m = e^{ikmx} \\\\). The behavior at x = T will depend on both k and m, which govern different rates of rotation after each transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
