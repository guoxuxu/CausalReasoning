  "Problem": "In the context of function analysis, consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial conditions and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. The effect of varying \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nGiven the output spectrum \\\\( F(z) \\\\) after an unknown intervention was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to one of the initial vectors (either \\\\( x \\\\) or \\\\( y \\\\)), is it possible to determine which vector was modified and identify the corresponding transformation matrix?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the lack of specific information about the time and nature of the intervention, and the inherent overlap in potential influences of transformations on \\\\( x \\\\) or \\\\( y \\\\), delineating the exact vector and transformation matrix from the Fourier spectrum alone is infeasible. Multiple configurations and interventions could result in the observed spectrum, leading to indeterminate conclusions about the specifics of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → e^{At}x; B → e^{Bt}y; t → z(t); z(t) → F(z); t_1 → z(t_1); z(t_1) → F(z); x → z(t); y → z(t); e^{At}x → z(t); e^{Bt}y → z(t); F(z) → possible intervention outcome; intervention → z(t_1); z(t_1) → possible vector modified; possible vector modified → possible transformation matrix"
