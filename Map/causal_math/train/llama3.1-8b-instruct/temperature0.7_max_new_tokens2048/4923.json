  "Problem": "Analyze a vector field transformation under the system \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. The transformation in question is defined by the mapping \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) = P\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where P is another constant matrix and affects the vector \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) at time t=0.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention of a new transformation \\\\( k(\\\\mathbf{x}) = Q\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) (where Q is a constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on P or Q?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of \\\\( k(\\\\mathbf{x}) = Q\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the final state \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(T) \\\\) becomes dependent not just on M, but also significantly influenced by P and Q. The transformations due to P and Q could impact the trajectory and outcome of the system, affecting the state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
