  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod along the x-axis is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t}h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a spatial function and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) a decay constant, is applied.\n\nCan we precisely determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), based solely on the observed temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects of the exponential decay from \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and the arbitrary function introduced in \\\\( g(u) \\\\), it is challenging to disentangle and accurately attribute specific influences to either \\\\( f(u) \\\\) or \\\\( g(u) \\\\) based solely on the final observation of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). Both interventions could yield similar or conflating effects, making it infeasible to identify them precisely from the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
