  "Problem": "We explore the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z dt \\\\), where D is also a complex constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( I(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The state at time T, given unknown initial application of \\\\( I(z) \\\\), may stem from varying initial conditions or transformations. The complexities introduced by the integration and possible exponential transformations obscure the ability to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without definite structure knowledge of D relative to C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
