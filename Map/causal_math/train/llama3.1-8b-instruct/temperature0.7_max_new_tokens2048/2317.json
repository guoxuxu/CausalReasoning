  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L: V \\\\rightarrow W \\\\) mapping between vector spaces V and W. We analyze the effect of a specific transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described as a multiplication by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), acting on vector space V before and after applying operator L.\n\nDoes the linear transformation \\\\( L(v) \\\\) yield the same result whether or not the transformation \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\) is applied to the vector \\\\( v \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of applying \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( v \\\\) might differ substantially from applying \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\). The transformation with matrix M can alter the vector space such that L's outcome on the transformed space is different if the linear mapping is not commutative with M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
