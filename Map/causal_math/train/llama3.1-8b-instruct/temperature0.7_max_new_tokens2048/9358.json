  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit composed of a resistor (R), inductor (L), capacitor (C), and a power source that applies a voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system is described by the differential equation \\\\( V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int_0^t I(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the current as a function of time.\n\nBased on measuring only the total impedance at steady state, can we infer the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the voltage source applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the impedance has a complex relationship with frequency, reflected by \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = R + i(\\\\omega L - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega C}) \\\\), multiple frequencies could yield similar impedance values not distinctly distinguishable solely by their magnitude or phase. Therefore, exact inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the steady-state impedance alone is not reliable without further information about phase or other circuit conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
