  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the response \\( V(t) \\) over time t is governed by the differential equation \\( L\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}V = 0 \\), with L representing inductance, R resistance, and C capacitance. We explore the behavior following a Laplace transform of the voltage signal \\( V(t) \\), represented as \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\).\n\nHaving observed the Laplace transform \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) of the voltage, can we deduce the exact initial conditions used in the RLC circuit?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) encodes information about the overall system response, which includes the influence of initial conditions, but it does not allow for the exact retrieval of these conditions without additional specific information about either the initial voltage or its derivative.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
