  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator to produce an output \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nKnowing the structure of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), is it possible to precisely identify whether the change in the kernel from \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) to \\\\( k'(t, s) \\\\) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information, the specific change in kernels cannot be pinpointed merely from observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Similar effects on the output could be attributed to variations in the input signal or different types of kernel changes, causing uncertainty in identifying the type and timing of kernel interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
