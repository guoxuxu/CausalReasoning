  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) of a function u(t), where u(t) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + 5u = 0 \\\\). Consider an intervention where a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) is introduced to the solution u(t) before transforming it.\n\nGiven U(s) from the Laplace transformation, can we identify the initial value u(0) and u'(0) without explicit knowledge of the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial values u(0) and u'(0) and the form of the differential equation determine U(s). Without knowledge of the differential equation parameters, it is impossible to uniquely determine u(0) and u'(0) due to the multiple scenarios providing the same U(s) with different initial conditions and equation parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
