  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) which acts on a vector space and is defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\. The system evaluates the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the system dynamics when subjected to another transformation \\\\( S(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, at different instances.\n\nGiven the resultant state from a series of transformations involving \\\\( M \\\\) and possibly \\\\( N \\\\), can we unambiguously identify whether \\\\( N \\\\) was applied as an intervention, merely based on the observation at time \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or existence of interventions specifically involving \\\\( N \\\\), merely from the resultant state at \\\\( t \\\\), is not definite due to potential superposition and non-exclusive effects of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) in the space transformations, making the traces of individual transformations ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
