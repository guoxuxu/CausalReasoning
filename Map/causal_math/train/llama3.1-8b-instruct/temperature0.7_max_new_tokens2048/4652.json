  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) representing a controlled input.\n\nCan we accurately determine both the initial system parameters (A, B) and the intervention modifications (A', B') at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), based solely on observing the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to distinguish between the effects of the initial setup and the changes made at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The convolution integral includes contributions from before and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and without additional data, these cannot be uniquely separated or identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
