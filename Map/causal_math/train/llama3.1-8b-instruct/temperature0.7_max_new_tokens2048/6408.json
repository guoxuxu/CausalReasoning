  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t} z \\\\) is applied over time t, with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant. The system operates under the function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoints resulting from different combinations of rotations and exponential growth trajectories can be similar, creating overlap in possible outcomes. Disentangling the particular use of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) or \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both, from the final value is non-trivial due to the complex interplay of phase and magnitude modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
