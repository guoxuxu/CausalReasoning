  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the system's change under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, affecting the resultant state at t = T. The final state hence depends on the interactions and relative magnitudes of P, Q, and R through compounded exponential transformations, moving the system's trajectory away from that dictated solely by P.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
