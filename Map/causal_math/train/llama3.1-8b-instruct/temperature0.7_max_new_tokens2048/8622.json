  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional space where we deal with the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace Transform. We analyze the causality and effect relations within signals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and their Laplace Transforms \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\).\n\nGiven a Laplace Transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at some \\\\( s = T \\\\), can we always uniquely determine the original time function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that generated it?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the necessary and sufficient conditions are fulfilled for the function and the Laplace transform to be well-defined and inversely transformable, yes, it is possible to uniquely determine the original time function. The Laplace Transform is a bijective operation in its domain of interest, mapping each unique time-domain function to a unique complex function in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
