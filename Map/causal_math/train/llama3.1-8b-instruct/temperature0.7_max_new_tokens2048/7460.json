  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and the function evolves over time t. We investigate how transformations involving the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function affect computations and inferences.\n\nWith knowledge that a phase shift intervention occurred at some point before T, but not knowing exactly when or the magnitude, can we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T directly from the transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "Without exact knowledge of when and how the phase shift intervention occurred, it is impossible to accurately deduce the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T. The potential variability in phase (time and magnitude) introduces too many uncertainties to pinpoint the function prior to the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
