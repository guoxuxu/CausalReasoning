  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. A linear transformation by a complex matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function, resulting in \\\\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and the system is allowed to evolve under the dynamics specified by \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as the trajectory of \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) directly computed for each t?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is linear and constant, and it commutes with the time evolution operator of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the trajectory \\\\( w(t) \\\\) will exactly follow \\\\( Mz(t) \\\\) for all t, yielding the same trajectory when applied post-evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
