  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the implications of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then compute the solution to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) using this transformed initial condition, will the solution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as the solution obtained by directly solving \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) with \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform fundamentally changes the representation of the function from the time domain to the complex frequency domain. Solving the differential equation in the Laplace domain and then transforming back can introduce differences due to the properties of the inversion process and potential singularities in the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
