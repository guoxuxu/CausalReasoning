  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We introduce a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. This scenario examines the impact of this transformation on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely deduce which transformations were applied (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) just by knowing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping integral transformations and the non-exclusive influence of matrix exponentials on the trajectories, multiple transformation scenarios can lead to the same state at time T, making it challenging to uniquely identify the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
