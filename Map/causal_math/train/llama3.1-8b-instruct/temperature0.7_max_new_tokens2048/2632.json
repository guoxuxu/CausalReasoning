  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit in which the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) over time t is driven by a complex function of voltage \\\\( V(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the radian frequency. We explore how applying a Laplace transform to the voltage affects the current's behavior and the system's response.\n\nAfter observing the final transform current \\\\( \\hat{I}'(s) \\\\) at time T, can we determine unequivocally whether a filter was applied at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and the nature of this filter (value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed current \\\\( \\hat{I}'(s) \\\\) at T could result from several different filters or modifications to the input voltage characteristics. Without additional context or constraints, it’s impossible to determine the exact nature of the intervention or conclude definitively that an intervention occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
