  "Problem": "Consider a setup where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time in accordance to two linear systems \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Qy \\\\), with P and Q being constant matrices. The impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\), where R is another constant matrix, is examined.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) (where S is a constant matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the outcome \\\\( z(T) = x(T) + iy(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the matrices P and Q, and neither on R nor S?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with both \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduce additional dynamics to the system, meaning the final system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by R and S along with P and Q. The matrix exponentials interact and alter the trajectory of the system, implying that T's state depends on all matrices.",
