  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real functions of time and governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, D as constants. Analyze the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)M}z(s)ds \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIs it possible to definitively determine what transformations (either \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) were applied by only observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the variable effects that different sequences of transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), or their combined application could have, just knowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) doesn’t provide clear information on which specific interventions were employed. The nature of integral transforms allows for multiple possible combinations of N and M that could lead to the same observable effect at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
