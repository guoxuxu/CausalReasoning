  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and defined as \\\\( L[f(x)] = x^2f(x) \\\\). We investigate the properties of its responses under different transformation scenarios using the Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(x)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied by modifying \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to include another function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) where \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\) before applying the Laplace Transform, will the resulting transformation \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be solely determined by the original operator \\\\( L \\\\) ignoring the effects of \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by incorporating \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\) and then applying the Laplace Transform results in an interaction between \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\), affecting the final outcome. Specifically, the multiplication by \\\\( e^{-ax} \\\\) introduces additional terms in the differential operation in the s-domain, thus changing the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
