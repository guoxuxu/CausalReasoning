  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) by applying \\\\( f(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. This scenario explores how this transformation, particularly the Laplace transform, affects causal inference in a system's response.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification \\\\( g(u) = u(t) e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a constant scalar, will the end response \\\\( y(T) \\\\), for T > t_1 depend solely on K and not on s or \\\\( \\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) adjusts the input by introducing a decaying exponential factor, modifying the system's response. The final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the parameters \\\\( s \\) and \\\\( \\lambda \\) in addition to K, as each parameter alters the system's handling of the input differentially over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
