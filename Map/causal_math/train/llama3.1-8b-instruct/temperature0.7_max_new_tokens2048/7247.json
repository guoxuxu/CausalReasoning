  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( j(x) = e^{Gt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( G \\\\) is different constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( D \\\\) and not on \\\\( F \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention by \\\\( j(x) \\\\) further diversifies the factors influencing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent not only on D but also on matrices F and G. The influences of \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{G(T-t_1)} \\\\) post \\\\( t_1 \\\\) would combine in the system’s evolution, resulting in a complex interplay that affects the final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
