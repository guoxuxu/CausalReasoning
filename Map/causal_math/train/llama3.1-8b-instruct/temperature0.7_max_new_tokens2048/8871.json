  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) interacting with a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants. An influence is applied through a Fourier Transform defined by \\\\( G(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\omega^2} \\\\). We are interested in the system's behavior after consecutive transformations.\n\nIf at a specific time point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a Fourier Transform \\\\( G(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\omega^2} \\\\) is applied as an intervention to the system, will the final state in the Laplace domain, called \\\\( J(s) \\\\), be independent of the complexities introduced by \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the Fourier Transform \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) as an intervention further modifies the system's behavior, impacting both the effects from \\\\( L(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(z) \\\\). This new state \\\\( J(s) \\\\) will reflect influences from all previous transformations, making it dependent on both the initial \\\\( L(s) \\\\) and the subsequent \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
