  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of a transformation via the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t,x)\\\\} = U(s,x) \\\\) over variable t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by modifying the diffusion coefficient \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) is applied, will this change the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) for T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the thermal diffusivity parameter \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) modifies the rate of heat conduction within the medium. This fundamentally affects the spatial and temporal temperature profile, resulting in a different final temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
