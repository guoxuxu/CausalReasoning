  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be influenced only by \\\\( A \\\\) and not by \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the non-commutativity of complex multiplication, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both the initial transformation \\\\( B \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( C \\\\). The sequence of transformations affects the total dynamics, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( A, B, \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
