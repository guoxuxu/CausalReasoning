  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) in a complex domain where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are complex variables. Analyze how linear transformations \\\\(T(x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)\\\\) (where \\\\(a, b, c, d\\\\) are constants) affect the function.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\(f\\\\) at some time, can we determine the original coordinates \\\\(x_0, y_0\\\\) without knowing whether a transformation \\\\(T\\\\) had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T\\\\) could modify the coordinates in many ways, making it impossible to uniquely determine the original coordinates from the output value alone without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a linear transformation affects the function's output, but the original coordinates can be determined if the transformation is invertible."
