  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. This function is subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nKnowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after the interventions, can we determine whether both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( k(t) \\\\) were applied and, if so, their exact nature?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions and their parameters from the transformed outcome \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is challenging without additional data. Multiple combinations of A and B could yield the same or indistinguishable results in the transform, making it impossible to assert precisely what interventions were employed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
