  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is known to reconstruct \\\\( h(t) \\\\). We explore the impact of modifying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by a function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, on the time-domain representation of the function.\n\nKnowing only the resultant function from an unknown set of operations in the Laplace domain and observing a function that corresponds to a second derivative of a time-shifted \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we determine the exact sequence of transformations \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing the exact sequence and nature of transformations in the Laplace domain solely from the time-domain output is generally infeasible without additional constraints or data. Multiple Laplace domain operations could yield similar time-domain results, especially without knowing specific details like the parameters of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or the presence of \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
