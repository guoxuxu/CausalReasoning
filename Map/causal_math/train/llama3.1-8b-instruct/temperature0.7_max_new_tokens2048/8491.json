  "Problem": "Assume that a function \\\\( h: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) is defined as \\\\( h(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We investigate the effects of this transformation on complex-valued functions and their corresponding Fourier Transforms.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( a \\\\) to a new value \\\\( b \\\\) at some point after \\\\( f(z) = e^{az}g(z) \\\\) was initially transformed, and then the Fourier Transform is recalculated, will the outcome only depend on the new value \\\\( b \\\\), not on \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) does not erase the effects of the initial application of \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The outcome in the Fourier domain will reflect a combined influence of both the original transformation by \\\\( a \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( b \\\\), creating composite effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
