  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the effect of differentiating this function and the subsequent application of a Fourier transform.\n\nIf we apply a phase shift as an intervention to the function before differentiation, will this affect the Fourier transform of the differentiated function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a phase shift \\\\( e^{i \\\\phi} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( z(t) = e^{i (\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)} \\\\). Differentiating this modified function still affects its Fourier transform by translating its spectrum and altering amplitude characteristics due to the phase change. Thus, the intervention influences the differential operation's impact on the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
