  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p(x,t)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator and p(x,t) is a source function. We will investigate the influence of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x,t) dx \\\\), applied to the source function p(x,t).\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial condition p(x,0) after observing u(x,T) without knowing whether the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{p}(k,t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\hat{p}(k,t) \\\\), it is not possible to reverse-engineer the exact initial condition p(x,0) due to potential changes in the source function's frequency components, which are not directly observable from u(x,T) alone.",
