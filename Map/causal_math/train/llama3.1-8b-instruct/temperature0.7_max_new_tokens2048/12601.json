  "Problem": "Assume a system of partial differential equations governing heat flow in a rod, described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where u is the temperature and k is the diffusion constant. Explore the consequences of applying a temperature-dependent transformation \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda u} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial profile \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\), the exponential transformation might have significantly altered the initial temperature distribution, making it impossible to retrieve \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) without additional information about the use of \\\\( f(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
