  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping described by \\\\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\\\) in the complex plane, and assess the impact of an integral transformation on this function given as \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int e^{-st} w(t) \\\\, dt \\), where s is a complex number.\n\nCan we determine the original complex function form \\\\(w(z)\\\\) used to achieve a specific output at time \\\\(T\\\\) by solely observing the output without any knowledge of transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "As there were no transformations applied, the time evolution is only guided by the intrinsic properties of \\\\(w(z)\\\\). Thus, knowing the output at time \\\\(T\\\\) which follows this evolution allows tracing back to the exact form of \\\\(w(z)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
