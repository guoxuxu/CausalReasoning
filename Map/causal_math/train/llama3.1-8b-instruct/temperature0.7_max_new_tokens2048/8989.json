  "Problem": "Consider the application of a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We analyze the impact of this transformation over time when the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is combined with another transformed function under different scenarios.\n\nIf the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\) is taken resulting in \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then this result is used directly in a system analysis without further intervention, will the properties of \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) uniquely determine the behavior in the frequency domain compared to directly analyzing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform translates all information of the time domain function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain without loss of information. The behavior of \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain will uniquely correspond to the behavior of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in the time domain, ensuring a one-to-one mapping.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform of g(t) → G(ω); g(t) → a; b → G(ω); G(ω) → properties in the frequency domain; Fourier transform → properties in the frequency domain; g(t) → properties in the time domain; a → g(t); b → g(t); g(t) → Fourier transform of g(t); Fourier transform of g(t) → system analysis; system analysis → properties in the frequency domain; properties in the time domain → properties in the frequency domain"
