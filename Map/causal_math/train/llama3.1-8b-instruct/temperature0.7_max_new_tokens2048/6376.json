  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transform with a kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze its effect over time t.\n\nGiven the final state of the function at time T, can we determine which kernels were used (original and/or modified) during the transformation process?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which kernels were used from the final state of the function at time T is not feasible without additional data, as different kernel combinations can produce similar transformations due to their overlapping effects on the frequency and attenuation properties of the input function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
