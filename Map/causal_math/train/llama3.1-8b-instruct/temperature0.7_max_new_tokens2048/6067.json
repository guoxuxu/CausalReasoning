  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( bi \\\\) are real and imaginary components of the complex exponent respectively. The system is subject to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{(c+di)t}z \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\) being constants. Analyze the evolution and causality of this system over time.\n\nAssuming a transformation \\\\( g'(z) = e^{(e+fi)t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at \\\\( t = t_1 < T \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the initial parameters \\\\( a, b \\\\) and not on \\\\( e, f \\\\) or \\\\( c, d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( g'(z) \\\\) significantly affects the trajectory. Now, the state at \\\\( T \\\\) is a result of the multiple exponentials influencing it over different time intervals, making the final state contingent on all parameters \\\\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
