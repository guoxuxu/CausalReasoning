  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation being considered is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by dynamics under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\) without additional interventions, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was merely evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition and adds a frequency-based rotation, causing the trajectory in the complex plane to differ from that of just evolving under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\), which typically represents a simple rotational dynamic without scaling.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
