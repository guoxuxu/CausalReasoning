  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), with M being a linear operator. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), applied to the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\), transforming it into the s-domain.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}\\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace-transformed state \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at any given s match the transformation of the trajectory evolved directly from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolving under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) results in \\\\( X(s) = (sI - M)^{-1}x_0 \\\\). This relation holds whether the trajectory is transformed initially or after evolving; the evolution of the state variables under \\\\( M \\\\) and the linearity of the system preserve the relationship.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform → no direct causal link; initial condition → X(s); t = 0 → Laplace transform; X(s) → evolution under \\\\dot{x} = Mx; x_0 → Laplace transform"
