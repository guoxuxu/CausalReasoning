  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform of a function g(t) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = G(s) \\\\). We analyze how applying different initial conditions affects the inverse transform at a specific time T, where the initial conditions are modified by a constant k.\n\nIf at a specific time t_1 we apply an additional transformation \\\\( m(t) = h(t) + c \\\\) (where c is a constant), and compute the transform and its inverse, will the function m(T) for T > t_1 still be purely a function of h and not influenced by the initial conditions in g?",
  "Explanation": "The added constant c modifies the Laplace transform, and as a result, m(T) will depend on both the original function h(t) and the new addition, thus influenced by initial k scaling and the transformation c.",
