  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex-valued functions defined in the complex plane and the application of the Laplace transform, which is represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Analyze the behavior and relationships when these functions are subjected to transformations like multiplication by a constant or modification by an exponential decay factor.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can the specific form of the original time-domain function be uniquely determined without additional information about possible modifications (e.g., constant coefficients, shifts)?",
  "Explanation": "The form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the Laplace domain strictly corresponds to \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) in the time domain, assuming causality and that Re(s) > Re(a). Hence, the original time-domain expression can be uniquely defined from its Laplace transform under these standard assumptions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
