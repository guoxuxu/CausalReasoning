  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), resulting in the partial differential equation \\\\( Lu = 0 \\\\). We investigate the system's response to a mapping defined by \\\\( v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)] \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) represents a Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) directly from observing \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) without knowing prior application of \\\\( T[u(x,t)] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) is complicated without explicit knowledge of the transform \\\\( T \\\\), as the Fourier transform alters the representation and the linear operator can extend or suppress different spectral regions differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
