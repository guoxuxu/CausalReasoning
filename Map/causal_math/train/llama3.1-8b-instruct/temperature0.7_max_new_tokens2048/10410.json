  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is real and represents time, especially when transformed by another complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nGiven the value \\\\( z(T) = -1 \\\\) at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\), can we determine if the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( z(T) = -1 \\\\) at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\), this implies that the function was evolved under the original dynamics \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) because \\\\( e^{i\\\\pi} = -1 \\\\). Had \\\\( f(z) \\\\) been applied, the resulting value at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) would be \\\\( z(T) = 1 \\\\) due to the squaring effect of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on the evolution.",
