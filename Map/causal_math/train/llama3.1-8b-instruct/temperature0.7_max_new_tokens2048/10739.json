  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a vector space using a matrix M and its exponential \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) which acts on vectors in the space. We investigate the effects of initial transformations \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\), where N is another matrix, on the temporal evolution of vectors.\n\nIf an intervention using a transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{Lt}x\\\\) (where L is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state of the vector at T, \\\\(x(T)\\\\), be affected by earlier transformations (N) or solely depend on M and L?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory and therefore the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will be influenced not just by M and L but also N. The interactions among these transformations can compound over time and result in a different outcome, showing dependence on the sequence and type of transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
