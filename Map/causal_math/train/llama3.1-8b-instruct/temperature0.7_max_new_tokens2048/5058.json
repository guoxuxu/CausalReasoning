  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions prescribed on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). An input function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) represents the external heat added per unit time. We consider the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x,t) = u(x,t) + \\\\int_0^t h(x, \\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\) on the system over time t.\n\nGiven the observed temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing the function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the heat input function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\), it is impossible to backtrack uniquely to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) because the transformation due to \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) could have significantly altered the evolution pathway of the temperature distribution from any given initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
