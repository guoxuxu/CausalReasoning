  "Problem": "Consider the behaviour of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\), under the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\). Analyze how transformations affect causality in the complex function mapping and their implications on the frequency domain.\n\nBy applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and allowing the system to evolve naturally, will the transformed output \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) \\\\) at s = \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) confirm the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\). Evaluating at s = \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) will resonate, reflecting the internal frequency structure of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), confirming the presence of the original frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
