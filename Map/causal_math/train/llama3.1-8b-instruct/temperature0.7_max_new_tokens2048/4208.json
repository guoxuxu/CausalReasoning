  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. Let's delve into the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) applied over time t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nBased on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the interventions used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) and the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) entirely by analyzing the outcome at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given potential differentials in phase adjustments and how they impact the trajectory, multiple combinations of applications (or non-applications) of \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\) could lead to the same observed endpoint. The complex interactions and possibility of equivalent outcomes from different scenarios render precise identification unfeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
