  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyse how this function transforms under the operation of a complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} f(x) dx \\\\).\n\nIf the complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) result in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transform to \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), given by \\\\( T[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} e^{ix} dx \\\\), simplifies to \\\\( T[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{i(1-s)x} dx \\\\). This results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\) due to the orthogonality principle in Fourier series, as the integral evaluates to zero for all \\\\( s \\\\) except \\\\( s = 1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
