  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) being constant matrices, and \\\\(u\\\\) representing control input. We investigate the effect when applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) to the state vector.\n\nGiven only the transformed state \\\\( X(s) \\\\) after t = T, can we precisely determine the change in control from \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) and the influence of \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), or \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ability to pinpoint the specifics of control adjustments and the matrix contributions from just \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is limited. The transformed output aggregates effects over frequency, obscuring individual contributions and timings of changes in control and system matrices, thus precluding precise back-inference of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
