  "Problem": "Analyze the integral transformation \\\\( F(p) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(x) = cos(x) \\\\), where p represents a complex number. We study how changing the parameter p affects the transformation and the resulting function.\n\nWill the transformation output \\\\( F(p) \\\\) at \\\\( p = 1 + i \\\\) be substantially different from \\\\( p = 1 \\\\) without any additional manipulations of the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation depends on the parameter p, where a shift from a real to a complex value significantly alters the convergence and the behavior of the integral. The presence of the imaginary component modifies the decay rate of the exponential function, affecting the resultant integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "p → p = 1 + i; p → p = 1; p = 1 → F(p); p = 1 + i → F(p); F(p) → difference; F(p = 1) → F(p = 1 + i); difference → substantially different"
