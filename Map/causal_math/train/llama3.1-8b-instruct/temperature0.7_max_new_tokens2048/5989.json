  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) described by a pair of coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), where A and B are constants. Explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this system over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) is applied to the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the prescribed differential equations without additional intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same differential equations to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) alters the initial trajectory of the complex function. This transformation modulates the function by an exponential decay factor, fundamentally affecting the dynamics and resulting in a state which differs from that derived by plain differential evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
