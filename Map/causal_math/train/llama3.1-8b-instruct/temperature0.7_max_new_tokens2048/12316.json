  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} - ci \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are real constants.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially defined at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and evolves up to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without any external intervention, will the function subjected to \\\\( D \\\\) yield the same result as \\\\( e^{(a+bi)T} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), we get \\\\( Dz(t) = (a+bi-ci)e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), which implies the evolution under \\\\( D \\\\), modifies the phase of the exponential, resulting in a different function compared to the original \\\\( e^{(a+bi)T} \\\\) due solely to the influence of the term \\\\( -ci \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
