  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of electrical impedance in a circuit as a function of the frequency, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega) = R + \\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C} + j\\\\omega L\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) are resistance, capacitance, and inductance respectively, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Z(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to study the system's response.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is increased without adding any components to the circuit, will the impedance \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) at a higher frequency be the same as initially modeled by \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) affects each component of the impedance differently due to their frequency-dependent nature. The capacitive reactance decreases with increasing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), while inductive reactance increases, thereby changing the overall impedance.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
