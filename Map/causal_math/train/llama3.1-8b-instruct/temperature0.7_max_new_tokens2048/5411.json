  "Problem": "Consider a vector field represented by the function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) affects the field over time z, where B is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\) (where C is another constant complex matrix) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the vector field without considering the effects of B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduced as an intervention makes \\\\( z(T) \\\\) not only dependent on the original vector field but also significantly influenced by both transformations B and C. The numerous potential interactions between these exponential transformations can produce a diverse range of outcomes in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
