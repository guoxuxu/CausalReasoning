  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the system evolves naturally from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without applying the Laplace transform, will the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as the state at \\\\( T \\\\) if the Laplace transform had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\) maintains the modulation by the exponential term, whereas applying the Laplace transform and then evaluating it at \\\\( T \\\\) affects the domain from frequency to complex frequency space, fundamentally altering the nature of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
