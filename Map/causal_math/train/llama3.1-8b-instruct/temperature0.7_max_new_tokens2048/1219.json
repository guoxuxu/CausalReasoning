  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) where f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact of a complex function transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and its corresponding transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) = e^{-t} f(t) \\\\) at a certain time and we apply the Laplace transform, will the impact of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) remain unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) = e^{-t} f(t) \\\\) changes the characteristics of the original function and its subsequent transformations. The Laplace transform of the modified function will result in a different \\\\( H(s) \\\\) compared to \\\\( G(s) \\\\), illustrating the dependency on the nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
