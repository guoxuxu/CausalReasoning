  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in control theory, described by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \\\\), where \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) are polynomial functions of the complex variable s. We investigate the behavior of the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) when the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is subjected to the Fourier Transform of a step function, i.e., \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) after input \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\), can we determine the specific form of \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) in the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific polynomials \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) alone, as various combinations of these polynomials could produce the same overall transfer function behavior, particularly if only the output for a single input type (like a step function) is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
