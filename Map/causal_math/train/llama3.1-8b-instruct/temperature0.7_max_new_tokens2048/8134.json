  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) as a Laplace transformation applied on a time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). We further explore the effects of an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and t is time variable.\n\nGiven the results of the Laplace transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\), is it possible to determine definitively if the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was pre-modified by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) compared to it being in its original state of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the Laplace transform result, and without additional constraints or information about the specific nature of either function or matrix A, the identification of whether \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) was applied before \\\\( f(z) \\\\) cannot always be done. The transforms might produce the same outcome under specific conditions (e.g., if A has eigenvalues that align in certain ways with the response of z(t)).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
