  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We investigate the effect of the complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a definite time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after the intervention relies on the cumulative effects of matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and the newly introduced \\\\( C \\\\). The system's dynamics being influenced by these three matrices, each contributing complex exponential transformations, ensures that the final state reflects a combination of transformations, rather than being dictated by \\\\( A \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
