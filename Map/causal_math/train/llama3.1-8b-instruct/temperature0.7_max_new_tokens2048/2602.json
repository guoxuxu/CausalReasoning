  "Problem": "Analyze a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a matrix representing the system's dynamics. We consider the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial state, which alters the state's frequency components.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at a specific time T, can we deduce the exact initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowledge if a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied, it is impossible to reliably reconstruct the precise initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\). The potential alteration of frequency components by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) means multiple different initial conditions could lead to the same observed state at time T due to different spectral evolutions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
