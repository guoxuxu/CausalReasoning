  "Problem": "Assume the function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) given by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\). Evaluate results and transformations within the complex plane, specifically considering the impact of modifications by linear transformations represented by complex constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention described by multiplying \\\\(z\\\\) at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\) by a complex constant \\\\(b\\\\) is applied after initially transforming \\\\(z\\\\) by \\\\(e^{z}\\\\), will the final output strictly depend on the original function application without considering \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention directly modifies the original transformed value \\\\(e^{z}\\\\) further by applying another transformation, thus altering the final outcome. Therefore, the end result reflects changes not only from the original function \\\\(e^{z}\\\\) but also significantly from the complex multiplication by \\\\(b\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
