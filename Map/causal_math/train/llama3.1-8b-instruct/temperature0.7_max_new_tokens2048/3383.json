  "Problem": "Consider assessing the stability of a system described by a Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\frac{U(s)}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants and \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is a known function in the s-domain. We evaluate the effect of the inverse Laplace transform given by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{Y(s)\\\\} \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a stabilizing function \\\\( U(s) = e^{-st} \\\\) is introduced to modify \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), will the final behavior of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 depend solely on the new function and not on the original parameters a and b?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a new function modifies \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and influences the overall system behavior. However, the resulting dynamics still depend on the original parameters a and b because they define the underlying differential equation and therefore affect the overall system response even after intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
