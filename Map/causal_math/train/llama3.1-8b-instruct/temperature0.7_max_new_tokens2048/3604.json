  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the input and output of an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The input function is \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the output function is defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^T K(t,s)x(s) ds \\\\). Here T is a constant and the transformation is observed up to time T.\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) and the matrix A, can we determine whether the kernel function was altered at any point without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Just knowing the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) and the matrix A is insufficient to accurately ascertain whether any intervention or modification was made to the kernel function during the process. Multiple modifications could potentially lead to the same final output, thereby necessitating more information for precise back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → K; x(t) → y(t); y(T) → y(T); K → y(t); x(s) → y(t); A → y(t); s → y(t); t → y(t)"
