  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space defined over the complex plane and explore the effects of complex function transformations based on the function \\\\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\\\), where \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of this transformation on another function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) defined in the same space that evolves under an integral transformation \\\\(H(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-ixz} dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the final output \\\\(H(z)\\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine the original function or the specific transformations (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(i(z)\\\\), or both) applied, just by knowing \\\\(H(z)\\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The same output result \\\\(H(z)\\\\) can potentially be generated through different sequences or types of transformations due to the nature of complex exponential functions which could share similar effects in the frequency domain under the integral transformation. Without explicit knowledge of the transformations or original function, it is not possible to exactly discern what transformations were used or the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
