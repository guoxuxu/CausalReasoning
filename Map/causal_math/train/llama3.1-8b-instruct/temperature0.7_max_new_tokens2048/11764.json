  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = K \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where K is a diffusion coefficient, and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents a temperature distribution. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = u(x,t) e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) a positive constant, on the system dynamics over time.\n\nIf \\\\( v(x, 0) = u(x, 0) e^{-\\\\alpha \\\\cdot 0} \\\\) is initially set, and the system evolves according to the given PDE without further intervention, will \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) be the same as directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to time T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = K \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) alters the heat distribution over time. Even though \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) matches \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), their evolution will diverge because \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) continuously suppresses the amplitude of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), thus affecting the diffusion-driven changes in temperature distribution differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
