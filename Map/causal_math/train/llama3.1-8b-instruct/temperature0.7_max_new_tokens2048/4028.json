  "Problem": "In a control system, the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant system represented by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = H(s)X(s) \\), where \\( H(s) \\) is the transfer function and \\( X(s) \\) is the input in the s-domain. Consider the effect of an additive control intervention \\( u(t) \\) on the system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( U(s) \\). The modified system output is \\( Y(s) = H(s)(X(s) + U(s)) \\).\n\nGiven the output \\( Y(s) \\) at some time \\( T \\), can we distinguish whether the input was altered by \\( U(s) \\), only knowing \\( Y(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The information \\( Y(s) \\) alone, without additional constraints or knowledge about \\( U(s) \\), does not uniquely determine whether an intervention has occurred. Multiple combinations of \\( X(s) \\) and \\( U(s) \\) could lead to the same \\( Y(s) \\) due to the linear properties of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
