  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We study the effect of a linear transformation of variables defined by the matrix \\\\( T = \\\\begin{pmatrix} P & Q \\\\\\\\ R & S \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), applied initially at time t = 0.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new transformation \\\\( U \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is made (where \\\\( U \\\\) is another constant matrix), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the original differential equations and not influenced by \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a new transformation \\\\( U \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent not just on the original matrices A, B, C, and D but also significantly influenced by both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\). Their cumulative effects alter the trajectory and, thus, the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
