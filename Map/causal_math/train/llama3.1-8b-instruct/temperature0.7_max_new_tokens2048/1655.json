  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Nt} z \\\\, dt \\\\), with N also being a constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time T.\n\nIf an intervention using a different transformation \\\\( k(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{P t}z dt \\\\) (where P is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) rely solely on the evolution dictated by M, disregarding the effects of N and P?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) change the system's state fundamentally by integrating different exponential impacts over time. Therefore, the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the compounded effects of N, P, and the underlying dynamics of M, not solely M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
