  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period T.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( x \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T without knowing the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates over a period that precisely corresponds to a whole number of the function's oscillations (assuming \\\\( \\omega T = 2\\pi n \\\\), n being an integer), it effectively averages out to x. This allows for uniquely determining \\\\( x \\\\) if \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and T are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
