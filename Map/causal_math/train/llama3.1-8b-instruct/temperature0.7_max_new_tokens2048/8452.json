  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. We assess the implications of applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then transforming back, over time t.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly whether the modification with \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\) (or any transformation) was applied in the Laplace domain?",
  "Explanation": "The modification in the Laplace domain could result in a state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) that is attainable through different interventions or paths in the Laplace domain. Without knowing the history of interventions or specific properties of the applied transformations, it is impossible to ascertain the cause of the observed effect uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
