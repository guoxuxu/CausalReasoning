  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)dt \\\\), and its inverse on the system's behavior.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through an additional operation \\\\( H \\\\), a different linear differential operation is applied, will the behavior of \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent solely on the operator L and not on the Laplace transformation or H?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator H introduces new dynamics to the system, and thus the final state at time T depends not only on L but also significantly on the applied operator H and possibly the effects of the initial Laplace transformation that altered the state dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
