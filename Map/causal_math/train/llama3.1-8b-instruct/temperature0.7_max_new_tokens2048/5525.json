  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the consequences of applying a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( Mz = az + b \\\\), with \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) being complex numbers.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to obtain a new state \\\\( Mz_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will the state at time T, denoted as \\\\( z(T) \\\\), be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( M \\\\) modifies the initial state and therefore changes the trajectory of the system. The linear transformation introduces a shift and scaling that affects how the state evolves over time under the influences of \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\), resulting in a different final state at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
