  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolve according to coupled differential equations. Introducing the Laplace transform, the new dynamics are described by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t) + iy(t))(s) \\\\).\n\nFrom the Laplace domain representation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) used in the time domain without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) encodes information about the entire time-domain function into the complex frequency domain. Without additional constraints or information, several different time-domain functions can share the same Laplace transform, thus initial conditions cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
