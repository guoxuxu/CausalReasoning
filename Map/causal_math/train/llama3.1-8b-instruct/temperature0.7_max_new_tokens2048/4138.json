  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{mt} \\\\\\) where \\\\( m \\\\) is a complex number, evolving in a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a real constant. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{nt}z \\\\), applied at different times, where \\\\( n \\\\) is another complex number.\n\nCan we determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if we do not know whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of knowledge regarding the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) means that multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed outcome at time T, especially considering the complex nature of \\\\( n \\\\) which affects magnitude and phase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
