  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system having an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). An operator \\\\( G \\\\) defined by \\\\( Gx(t) = x(t - \\tau) \\\\) acts as a delay of \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds on the input.\n\nIf we observe the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after it has been shifted, can we determine the precise value of \\\\( \\tau \\\\) or confirm that \\\\( G \\\\) was applied without additional information on the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional knowledge about the original input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or its properties, we cannot precisely determine the delay \\\\( \\tau \\\\) or unequivocally conclude that an operation like \\\\( G \\\\) was applied. The output could be similarly shaped due to other factors or modifications in \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
