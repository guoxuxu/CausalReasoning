  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the state of a system z(t) is transformed by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-iB)s} z(s) ds \\\\), where A and B are matrices, and i is the imaginary unit. This system's behavior under temporal evolution is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we precisely determine if either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both were applied upon observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), given just the matrix C governing evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations or their sequence that led to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely from the knowledge of C is infeasible. The trajectories affected by complex and matrix exponentials, alongside intervention, imply numerous possibilities for reaching the observed state, each indistinguishable based solely on the final observation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
