  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) ds\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is an input function altering the state. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(u) = Cu\\\\), where C is a constant matrix transformation applied to the input.\n\nGiven the final state of the system \\\\(y(T)\\\\), is it possible to precisely identify the order and type of transformations applied (whether \\\\(f(u)\\\\), \\\\(g(u)\\\\), or both) by only analyzing \\\\(y(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\(y(T)\\\\) might result from different sequences or combinations of input transformations due to linear superposition in the integral and potential matrix interdependencies. This overlap in the effects produced by different transformation sequences makes it complex to uniquely backtrack and identify specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
