  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the temperature \\( T \\) of a substance is related to its electrical resistance \\( R \\) through the equation \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( R_0 \\) are constants. An additional thermal experiment involves the application of a function \\( g(T) = T + \\Delta T \\), where \\( \\Delta T \\) is a constant temperature change.\n\nIf \\( g(T) \\) is applied resulting in a new temperature \\( T + \\Delta T \\) at time \\( t \\), will the resistance \\( R(T + \\Delta T) \\) at \\( T \\) depend only on \\( a \\), not on \\( \\Delta T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(T) \\) modifies the temperature by adding \\( \\Delta T \\), thereby changing the course of the resistance evolution to \\( R(T + \\Delta T) = R_0 e^{a(T + \\Delta T)} \\). Consequently, the final resistance value is influenced by both \\( a \\) and \\( \\Delta T \\), signifying a dependency beyond just \\( a \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
