  "Problem": "Consider a reaction-diffusion system expressed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u + k(u)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator and \\\\(k(u)\\\\) is a nonlinear function of u. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) over the spatial variable x.\n\nCan we determine the precise original state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) from knowing \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, assuming no initial transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing the effects of time evolution and nonlinear response under the diffusion operator through the inverse Laplace transform is complicated, typically impossible to distinguish without additional information or constraints about the nonlinearity or the initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x,0) → k(u); k(u) → Δu; Δu → ∂u/∂t; ∂u/∂t → ∂u/∂t at T; ∂u/∂t at T → u(x,T); ∂u/∂t at T → ∂u/∂x at T; ∂u/∂x at T → u(x,T) via Laplace transformation; u(x,T) → u(x,0) via inverse Laplace transformation"
