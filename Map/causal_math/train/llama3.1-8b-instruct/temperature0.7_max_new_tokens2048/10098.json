  "Problem": "Consider a function h(z) defined over the complex plane, and let's apply a Fourier transform on this function, denoted as H(w), to analyze its behavior in frequency space.\n\nGiven H(w) derived from the Fourier transform of z^n, can we uniquely determine the value of n?",
  "Explanation": "The specific characteristics and behavior of H(w) in the frequency space, such as poles and decay rate, allow us to infer back the value of n, assuming z^n is the only form of function h(z) was in.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "n → z; z → H(w); n → H(w); z^n → H(w); H(w) → Fourier transform of z^n"
