  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) which converts the function u(x, t) into its frequency components \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filtering process \\\\( \\\\mathcal{H}(\\\\hat{u}) = h(k)\\\\hat{u} \\\\) (where \\\\( h(k) \\\\) represents a filter in the frequency domain) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\( h(k) \\\\) modifies the frequency components directly, which alters the progression under the operator L. Therefore, the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) depends not only on L but also significantly on the nature of the filter applied, even if the initial condition was transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
