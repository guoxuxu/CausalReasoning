  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Laplace transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\) with a constant matrix A on a complex function space. The transformed function is \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(s) \\\\). We will analyze the function after applying an inverse Laplace transform, possibly with an operational matrix M applied to it.\n\nIf an operational transformation given by an additional matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) is applied after inversely transforming \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(s) \\\\) to \\\\( g^{\\\\prime}(t) \\\\), will the end function \\\\( g^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}(t) \\\\) purely reflect the effects of matrix A without being affected by matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The operational transformation by \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) post inverse Laplace transformation will convey additional dynamics imposed by M. Thus, the resultant \\\\( g^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}(t) \\\\) represents a mixture of influences from both matrices A and M, altering the original dynamics characterized solely by A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
