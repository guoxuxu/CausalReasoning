  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Cu\\\\), where C is a linear operator. We further explore the role of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ds}u(s) ds \\\\) where D is another linear operator.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at endpoint, and being aware that transformations were applied (either \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( R(u) \\\\), or both), can we determine which transformations were definitely used?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could be reached through multiple pathways involving different combinations or sequences of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( R(u) \\\\). The overlapping effects of these transformations under the linearity of the system make it impossible to uniquely determine the exact sequence or nature of interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
