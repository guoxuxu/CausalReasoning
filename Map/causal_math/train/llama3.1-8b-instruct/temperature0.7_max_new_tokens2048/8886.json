  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation of a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\).\n\nGiven the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at arbitrary time T, can we deduce the exact original function or its parameters like \\\\( \\omega \\\\) just by using the endpoint data?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint information at time T gives us the status of the function at that specific instant, but due to the periodic and oscillatory nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), multiple frequencies (values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\)) could provide the same value at time T due to periodic overlaps, making it impossible to uniquely identify \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or recover the initial exact function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
