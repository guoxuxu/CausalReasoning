  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\\\) where A is a matrix and v is a complex constant vector. The system is then subjected to a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the initial vector \\\\( v \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and subsequently Fourier transformed to \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the transformed representation in the frequency domain be equivalent to performing any direct transformation on \\\\( v \\\\) without passing through \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations conducted by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and the Fourier transformation fundamentally alter the representation of \\\\( v \\\\) in complex and frequency domains, respectively. This sequential processing prevents equivalence to any direct transformation of \\\\( v \\\\) that skips these stages.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
