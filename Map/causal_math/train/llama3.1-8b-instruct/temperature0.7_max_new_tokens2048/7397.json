  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We are interested in the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) before the system evolves.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and left unaltered as the PDE solution evolves, will the transformed system's state \\\\( \\\\widehat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) had evolved directly under the given PDE to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the Fourier transform changes the representation of the data to frequency space, which affects how the diffusion operates on the data. The evolving process in frequency space, governed by the transformed PDE, results in a different state \\\\( \\\\widehat{u}(k, T) \\\\) compared to the direct evolution in real space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
