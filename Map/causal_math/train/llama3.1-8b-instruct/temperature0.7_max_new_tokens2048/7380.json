  "Problem": "Consider a system is modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t) + ig(t) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. Integral operator \\\\( K \\\\) defined by \\\\( K[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during its evolution.\n\nCan we infer whether only \\\\( K \\\\), only \\\\( L \\\\), or both were applied during the interval [0, T], by examining the final outcome \\\\( K[z](T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which operators were applied from the final state alone is challenging due to the convolution nature of these operators and the potential overlapping effects. Both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) can lead to similar integrative effects over different initial conditions or intervention intervals, making it difficult to ascertain the exact history of operator applications uniquely from the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
