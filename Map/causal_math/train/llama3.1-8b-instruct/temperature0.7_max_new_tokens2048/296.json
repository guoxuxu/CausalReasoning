  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact when this function undergoes a Fourier transform over time t.\n\nAssuming the observed Fourier transform shows two peaks, at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\eta \\\\), can we definitively conclude the specific interventions applied (sequence or type of multiplications by exponential functions)?",
  "Explanation": "The appearance of additional frequency peaks could result from various interventions and their sequences, such as different timings or combinations of exponential functions. The precise nature (order and type) of these interventions cannot be uniquely determined from the resulting frequency spectrum alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
