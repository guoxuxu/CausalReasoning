  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in a complex plane, described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. We introduce a transformation given by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, affecting the amplitude and phase of \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a new mapping \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions using \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) significantly influence the trajectory and the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Each of the transformations associated with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) affects the amplitude and phase of the trajectory, leading to a dependency on both in addition to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
