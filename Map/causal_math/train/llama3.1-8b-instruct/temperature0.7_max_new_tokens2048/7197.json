  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system operating on a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) describes a path in the complex plane. The system is described by the matrix operator \\\\(L\\\\) such that the transformation is \\\\(w(t) = L[z(t)]\\\\) involving a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\). Analyzing the effect of modifications to \\\\(L\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nIf \\\\(L\\\\) is defined as a convolution operator with a specific kernel \\\\(k(t)\\\\), and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is initially processed with \\\\(L\\\\) without any other operators applied, will the output \\\\(w(t)\\\\) remain unchanged if the convolution kernel is altered after the initial application?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the kernel \\\\(k(t)\\\\) after its initial application fundamentally alters the convolution operation which depends on the integral of the product of \\\\(k(t)\\\\) and \\\\(z(t)\\\\). The change in \\\\(k(t)\\\\) means that \\\\(w(t)\\\\) will not simply follow the original transformation trajectory, resulting in a different output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
