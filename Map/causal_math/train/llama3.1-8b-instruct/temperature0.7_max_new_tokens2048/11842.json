  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) to the system, with its inverse transform typically denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention alters the operator to \\\\( M \\\\), changing the equation to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Mu \\\\), can the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) depends on the evolution under both L and M. The changes introduced by the intervention (from L to M) alter the system’s subsequent behavior starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), while the evolution prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still influences the conditions at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
