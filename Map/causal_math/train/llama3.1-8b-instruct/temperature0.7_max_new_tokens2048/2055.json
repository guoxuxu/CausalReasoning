  "Problem": "Examine the application of Laplace transforms in a control system where an input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( L(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\). The system's response \\\\( X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) represents the complex frequency domain, is dictated by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The analysis focuses on the behavior of the system under different transformations and interventions.\n\nIf an additional filtering process represented by another transfer function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_2 \\\\) and applied to the output of the initial system, will the combined system's endpoint output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) be influenced only by the original transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not by \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output response \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) now becomes \\\\( G(s) X(s) = G(s) H(s) U(s) \\\\), indicating that the outcome is dependent on both the original and the newly introduced transfer functions. The intervention alters the overall behavior and response of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
