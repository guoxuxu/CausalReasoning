  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) in a complex function domain, where \\( A \\) is a complex constant matrix and \\( x \\) is an initial complex vector. This setup is used to analyze the system's behavior under transformations involving integral transformations such as the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\).\n\nKnowing the result of the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\), is it possible to directly infer the original vector \\( x \\) without knowledge of whether the transformation \\( e^{At}x \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\( e^{At}x \\), the resulting \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\) can originate from varied transformations and initial conditions due to different potential dynamics introduced by the transformation \\( A \\). This ambiguity precludes exact back-calculation to \\( x \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
