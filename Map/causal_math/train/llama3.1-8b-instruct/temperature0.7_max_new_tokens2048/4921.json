  "Problem": "Analyze a vector field transformation under the system \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. The transformation in question is defined by the mapping \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) = P\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where P is another constant matrix and affects the vector \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) at time t=0.\n\nIf \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) = P\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) modifies the initial vector, altering its trajectory under the dynamical system. The difference in trajectories hinges on the properties and relationship between M and P, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
