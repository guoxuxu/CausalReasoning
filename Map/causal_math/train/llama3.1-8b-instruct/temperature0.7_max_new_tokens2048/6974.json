  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving under the influence of a potential field governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\). The potential field is perturbed by an added magnetic field, described by a vector potential \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\). The effect of \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) is represented through the transformation \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t) = \\\\vec{A} \\\\times \\\\vec{x}\\\\) at time t.\n\nCan we reverse-engineer the initial position and velocity of the particle at t = 0 after observing it at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without exact knowledge of the application of \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t)\\\\), the trajectory could be one of an infinite number given different potential magnetic perturbations. The cross product interaction between \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\vec{x}\\\\) obscures the initial conditions from being uniquely reconstructed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
