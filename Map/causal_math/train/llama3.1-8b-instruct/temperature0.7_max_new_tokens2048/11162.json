  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. To analyze causal inferences, we introduce an integral transform \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the integral transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) influenced its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the impact of Q, the integral transform, it's challenging to reverse-engineer the system accurately to its initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The influence of Q during the transformation process masks the pristine effect caused solely by P.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
