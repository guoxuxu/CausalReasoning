  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) is used to solve the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = f(t) \\\\). The transform function is applied to both sides leading to an algebraic equation in the complex domain.\n\nGiven an observation of the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the presence of the intervention \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we definitively determine the original causal input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowledge of the intervening input?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the intervention \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its influence, it is not possible to uniquely decompose \\\\( y(t) \\\\) into its constituent causes \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The lack of information about how much of the output is due to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) versus \\\\( g(t) \\\\) creates inherent ambiguities in the causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
