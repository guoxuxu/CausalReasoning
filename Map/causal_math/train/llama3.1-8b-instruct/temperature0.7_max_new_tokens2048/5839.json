  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\). We explore the impact of transforming the variable \\\\(u\\\\) using a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different transformation \\\\( h(u) = u - k \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the differential equation and not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) again changes the state of the system, which due to the nonlinear differential equation affects the future state trajectory. The system's endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will depend not only on the governing equation but also significantly on the transformations applied at different times.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
