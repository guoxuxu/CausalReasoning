  "Problem": "Consider a complex analytic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impacts of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Me^{Qt}z \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will the z(t) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the initial state by the matrix exponential \\\\( Me^{Qt} \\\\), which affects how the system evolves under the dynamics \\\\( Pz \\\\). Thus, the trajectory and final state at t = T are modified by the initial transformation, resulting in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
