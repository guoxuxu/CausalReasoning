  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex function, and both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The interaction between \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) via \\\\( u \\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( u \\\\) modifies the function forms of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x_0, y_0) \\\\) at time t = 0, will the later state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as without the initial application of \\\\( u \\\\) at T > 0?",
  "Explanation": "The initial modification by \\\\( u \\\\) alters the paths of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depending on how \\\\( u \\\\) transforms these vectors. This change affects how both interact over time, leading to a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) than if \\\\( u \\\\) was not applied initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
