  "Problem": "Consider a system where temperature distribution over a rod is described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a diffusion constant. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = u + c \\\\) (where c is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the Fourier transform applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(u) \\\\) shifts the temperature profile by adding a constant c, but the initial Fourier transformation influences how the temperature profile evolves under the heat equation. As such, both the Fourier transform and the intervention would significantly influence the resultant temperature profile at time T.",
