  "Problem": "Explore the relationships in a mathematical model where the periodic function \\\\( x(t) = cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by the integral transform \\\\( L\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nConsidering the final output after applying both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), can one accurately backtrack to determine if \\\\( M \\\\) was applied and the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used, just by observing the transform outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the transform after using \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) could match outputs from various configurations of frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and decay constant \\\\( s \\\\), especially with different degrees and patterns of derivative impact by \\\\( M \\\\). This ambiguity prevents uniquely pinpointing whether \\\\( M \\\\) was applied and determining the original frequency without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
