  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. Suppose we analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nAssuming an intervention by modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( \\hat{z}(t) = z(t) + e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, and then applying \\\\( L \\\\), does the new transformed function \\\\( L[\\hat{z}(t)] \\\\) depend solely on the original function parameters and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function before transformation, adding a decaying exponential term that will affect the Laplace transform result. Thus, the transformed function \\\\( L[\\hat{z}(t)] \\\\) will reflect both the original function's behavior and the effects of the exponential term introduced by the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
