  "Problem": "Consider a functional space where functions are transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\), which represents the Laplace transform. The initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and its transform are studied over different conditions and manipulations of variable x.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function at a specific x, can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity or further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, while being a powerful tool in analysis, typically requires additional constraints or information to uniquely identify the original function due to the possibility of different functions sharing the same transform (non-injectivity issues). Knowledge of specific characteristics or boundary conditions of the original function is necessary.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
