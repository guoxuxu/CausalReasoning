  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = te^{-t} \\\\). We further explore the role of inverse transformations and additional operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we uniquely determine \\\\(f(t)\\\\) as the cause once we know \\\\(G(s)\\\\) without additional data about the system?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\(G(s) = sF(s)\\\\) allows for the determination of \\\\(F(s)\\\\) by simple algebraic manipulation (division by s). As long as \\\\(s \\\\neq 0\\\\), we can recover \\\\(F(s)\\\\) and subsequently apply the inverse Laplace transformation to uniquely determine \\\\(f(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
