  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is used. We explore the properties as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoes transformations along the real and imaginary axes respectively in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + bi \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 = x + yi \\\\) where x and y are real numbers, and then the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is evaluated, will the outcome be the same as if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was directly evaluated at \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the original complex number by scaling and/or translating it along the real and imaginary axes. This modification results in a different argument in the exponential function, which will significantly alter the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), making it different from its evaluation at the unmodified \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
