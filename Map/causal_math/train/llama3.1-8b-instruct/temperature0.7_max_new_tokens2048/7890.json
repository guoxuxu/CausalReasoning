  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the system's response under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), applied over a time interval from 0 to T.\n\nKnowing the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) over the specified interval T, can we infer the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of the system, assuming no further information about interventions or initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) provides aggregated information over the period T and includes effects of both the system's dynamics under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and the external influence \\\\( k \\\\). Without distinct initial state information or detailed knowledge of \\\\( k \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alone is indeterminate due to possible variations in the initial conditions and contributions from \\\\( k \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
