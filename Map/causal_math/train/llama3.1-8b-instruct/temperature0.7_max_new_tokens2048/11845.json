  "Problem": "Consider a mapping of functions where \\\\( g(u, x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x, z) \\\\) are integral transforms with respective kernels \\\\( K_1 \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\. The system explores the influence of transformations \\\\( u(x) = \\\\int K_1(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int K_2(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), analysing dynamics between input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and output \\\\( z(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at time X, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information about the kernels \\\\( K_1 \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the exact form of the kernels \\\\( K_1 \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\), the operational pathway from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is unclear. Multiple different \\\\( f(t) \\\\) functions could potentially yield the same \\\\( z(x) \\\\) if the kernels were unknown, thereby preventing a unique inversion.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
