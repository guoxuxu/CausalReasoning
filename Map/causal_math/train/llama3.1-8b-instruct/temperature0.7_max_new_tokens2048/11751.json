  "Problem": "Examine the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the coupled differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\) respectively. Consider the effect of the linear operator \\( L(z) = e^{Mt}z \\) where M is a constant matrix, applied at different intervals.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which interventions (whether \\( L(z) \\), \\( K(z) \\), or both) were applied, just by looking at \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\( z(T) \\) could possibly be the result of different combinations of interventions due to the complexity brought in by non-commutativity of the matrix exponentials M and N and their effects on the complex plane. The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) does not uniquely specify the paths or transformations leading to it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
