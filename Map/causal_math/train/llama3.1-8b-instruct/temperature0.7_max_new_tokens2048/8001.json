  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation under various conditions. We analyze the impact of a non-linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(v) = \\\\sinh(kv) \\\\) where k is a constant, on the initial velocity profile \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) of the fluid.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is applied to the initial velocity profile \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the Navier-Stokes equation without further intervention, will the velocity profile \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if the initial profile was directly evolved to t = T under the Navier-Stokes equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(v) \\\\) significantly alters the initial conditions by introducing non-linearities. The behavior of the system under the Navier-Stokes equation will be fundamentally different due to the altered initial state, resulting in a different velocity profile at any future time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
