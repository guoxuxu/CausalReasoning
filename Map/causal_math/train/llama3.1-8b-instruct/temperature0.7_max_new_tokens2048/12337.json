  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) exactly at t = 0 from the result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) without knowing that transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) involves an integral with an exponential function, it inherently alters and obscures some information about the initial conditions of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\), making it impossible to precisely backtrack to \\\\( z_0(0) \\\\) without specific knowledge of the transformation applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
