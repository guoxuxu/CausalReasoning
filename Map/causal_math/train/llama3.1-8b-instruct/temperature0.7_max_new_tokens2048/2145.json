  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze changes in solution behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = e^{\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( e^{\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 to become \\\\( v(x,0) \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) match the state \\\\( e^{\\\\omega T}u(x,T) \\\\) when directly evolving \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation multiplicatively alters initial conditions and factors out of the differential operator due to its linearity and independence from u. Therefore, each state evolves similarly just scaled by \\\\( e^{\\\\omega t} \\\\), maintaining consistency between the transformation-applied version and direct evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
