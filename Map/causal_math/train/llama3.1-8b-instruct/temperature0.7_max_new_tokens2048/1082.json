  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\. Over time, the function describes a circular trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can we unambiguously determine the initial complex value \\\\( x \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation is a pure rotation, knowing \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}x \\\\) allows us to uniquely backtrack the rotation to determine \\\\( x \\\\) as \\\\( x = e^{-iAT}z(T) \\\\), thus retrieving the original complex number.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
