  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. The impact of the Laplace transform on this function is analyzed over a variable \\\\(s\\\\) in the complex domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(H(s)\\\\) of the intervened function \\\\(h(z)\\\\), can we determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) purely based on \\\\(H(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\(H(s)\\\\) alone, due to the form \\\\((sI - (A+B))^{-1}\\\\), it cannot be uniquely determined whether A or B or a combination of both were operational without additional information. Different matrices A and B can generate similar transforms, leading to indeterminacy in identifying the precise interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
