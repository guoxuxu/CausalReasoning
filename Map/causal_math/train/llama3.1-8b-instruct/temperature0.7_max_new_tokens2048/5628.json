  "Problem": "Analyze a controlled system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{t} + cu_{x} = 0\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. A transformation is considered, defined by \\\\( g(u) = U(x,t) \\\\) where U is an integrating factor related to u, potentially altering the system dynamics.\n\nConsidering the observed endpoint \\\\( U(x,T) \\\\), is it feasible to precisely identify which transformations (either \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both) were active during the evolution, solely based on the final outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( U(x,T) \\\\) could arise from various combinations of interventions and initial setups due to the complex interplay and potential for overlapping effects of the transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\) in the PDE dynamics. Identifying exact interventions based on outcome alone would require more specific information about the transformations' impact and mechanism.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
