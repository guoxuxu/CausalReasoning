  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, D are constants. The system is subjected to a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing a frequency.\n\nWith knowledge of the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively determine which transformations (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the interval from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the independence in the phase modifications caused by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and their compounded effect, dissecting the precise contributions from each without additional data on when or how these transformations were applied is impossible. Multiple scenarios could lead to the same observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\), rendering the causal pathway indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
