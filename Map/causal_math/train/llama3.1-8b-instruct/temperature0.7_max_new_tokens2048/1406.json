  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on a region in the complex plane under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^t dt \\\\). Analyze the impact of this function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\)) at a specific \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)), can we determine the original path taken in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Since the value of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\)) is path-independent as long as the path does not enclose any singularities, and given that \\\\\\\\(( e^t \\\\\\\\)) has no singularities, any value of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\)) at \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) can be achieved via multiple paths, rendering it impossible to uniquely determine the path based only on the endpoint value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
