  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation system given by \\\\( y = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. We investigate the change in outcome when a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is applied to the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( x * h \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then transformed by \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\), will the transformed result at s be the same as directly applying \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without convolution?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution operation modifies the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and thus, the outcome of the Laplace transform will also change because the Laplace transform of a convolution is the product of individual transforms, i.e., \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x * h\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x\\}(s) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}\\{h\\}(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
