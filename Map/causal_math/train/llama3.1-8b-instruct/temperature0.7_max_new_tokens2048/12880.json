  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} dt \\\\), where z is a complex number with a positive real part. We explore the impact of two transformations defined by the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) on the complex plane as \\\\( A(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( B(z) = z + 1 \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( A(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is evaluated without further intervention, will \\\\( f(A(z)) \\\\) at \\\\( z \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( A(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the function argument significantly, affecting the properties and behavior of the integral. The transformation changes how the complex exponential decays along the integration path, leading to different results for \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( f(z^2) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
