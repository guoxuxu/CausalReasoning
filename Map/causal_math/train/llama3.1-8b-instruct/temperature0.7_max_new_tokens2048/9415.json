  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of modifying \\\\( s \\\\) and using an intervention function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nIf an intervention using function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + h(t) \\\\), will the transformed signal \\\\( S(z') \\\\) at time T > t_1 depend solely on the original parameters \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) as an intervention changes the signal by adding a quadratic time-dependent term, which influences both the growth and the resultant integral. Thus, \\\\( S(z') \\\\) will depend on the new signal characteristics created by the intervention along with the effects of \\\\( s \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
