  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\), where V is the electric potential. A transformation under a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) (with \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) representing spatial variables) is applied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to modify the potential V at a boundary at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will the potential V at any other point change as a direct result of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the boundary conditions, thereby altering the solutions to the Laplace equation. Since the potential V in the region influenced by these boundary conditions is determined by these new conditions, the potential V at any point is altered by this transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
