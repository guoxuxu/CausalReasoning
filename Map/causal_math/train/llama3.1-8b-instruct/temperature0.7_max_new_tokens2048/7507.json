  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of complex transformations applied to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) in the complex plane, described by \\\\(h_1(z) = e^{Az}h(z)\\\\) initially and then \\\\(h_2(z) = e^{Bz}h_1(z)\\\\) after some time T, where A and B are complex constants.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(h_3(z) = e^{Cz}h_2(z)\\\\) is applied at time t > T as an intervention, will the resulting function \\\\(h_3(T)\\\\) now depend only on the sum of A, B, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation behaves similarly to the previous transformations, where the influences of A, B, and C in the exponent sum linearly due to the properties of exponentiation in the complex plane, resulting in a combined transformation effect exp((A + B + C)T).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
