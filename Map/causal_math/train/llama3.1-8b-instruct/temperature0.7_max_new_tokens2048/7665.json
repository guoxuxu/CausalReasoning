  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a response function represented by the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. A signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is input into the system, and its Laplace transform is \\\\( X(s) \\\\). The output of the system, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is given by the inverse Laplace transform of the product \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is given and a signal \\\\( x(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) (where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant) is applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be predictable from the initial conditions using the convolution integral?",
  "Explanation": "Given the known inputs and the system's linear time-invariant (LTI) properties, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) can be exactly predicted by calculating the convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), which is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The nature of LTI systems ensures that the relation between \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is predictable and dependent only on the initial systems settings and input.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
