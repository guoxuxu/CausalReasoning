  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), that changes the representation of \\\\(u\\\\) from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) is transformed by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and evolved under the transformed PDE without any additional manipulation, will the resulting function at time \\\\(T\\\\), after applying the inverse Fourier transform, be identical to the function obtained by directly solving the original PDE with \\\\(u_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is a linear isomorphism in this context, applying it to the initial condition and then evolving under the transformed PDE conserves the relationships and properties across the transformation. Solving in the frequency domain and converting back gives the exact solution as solving in the original time domain.",
