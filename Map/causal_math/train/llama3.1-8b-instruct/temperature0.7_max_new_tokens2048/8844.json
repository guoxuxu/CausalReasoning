  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -kx\\\\), with a constant decay rate k. The impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\(L[f(t)](s)\\\\) on this system is explored, where \\\\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\\\). The transformation variable s is complex.\n\nAfter observing the altered system's behavior post-intervention and calculating its Laplace transform, can we determine which specific decay rate (k or \\\\(k'\\\\)) was applied at any time without prior knowledge of the intervention times?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific intervals during which the decay rates were modified, it is impossible to distinguish whether the observed behavior corresponds solely to k, \\\\(k'\\\\), or a combination of both. The Laplace transform gives a cumulative measure of the system’s behavior, which without temporal details of the intervention, does not reveal specific rates applied at specific times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
