  "Problem": "Explore the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are distinct constant matrices. We assess the results when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specifically determine what transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied at times t=0 or t_1 by just studying \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential transformation characteristics of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) can lead to overlapping effects, which means different combinations of transformations might result in similar or identical states at T. Thus, identifying the exact interventions used solely based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
