  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of linear operators \\\\( L \\\\) on this system, defined by matrix multiplication on complex numbers in the form \\\\( Lz = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or whether the operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied, without further information?",
  "Explanation": "From the observed state \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\) alone, it is impossible to distinguish whether the initial state was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or a transformed state \\\\( Mz_0 \\\\) due to operator \\\\( L \\\\), unless additional properties of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
