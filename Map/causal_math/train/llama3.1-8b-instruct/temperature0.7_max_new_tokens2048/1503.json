  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate how the integral transformation \\\\( F[z(t)] = \\int_0^T e^{-Ct}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with C as another constant matrix, impacts this system over time T.\n\nAssuming a new matrix D is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) altering the system into \\\\( F[z(t)] = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{-Dt}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and B without influence from C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( D \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the weighting function, significantly affecting how the trajectory data from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is accumulated and thus altering the integrated result. Both C (up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) and D (after \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) influence the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
