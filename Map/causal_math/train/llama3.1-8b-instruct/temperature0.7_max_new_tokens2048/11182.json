  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\). Let's introduce a complex transformation represented by \\\\( p(x) = e^{i \\\\theta}x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number. Analyze the behavior of a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) within this framework.\n\nGiven the final state after both transformations, \\\\( q = e^{i \\\\theta}Mx_0 \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing the sequence of transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( q \\\\), and known the transformations and their dependencies being linear and scalar multiplication, one can algebraically solve for \\\\( x_0 \\\\) irrespective of the order in which the transformations were applied. This inverse operation would involve applying the inverse transformations in the reverse order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
