  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. We examine the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) to the system, where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) adds a new layer of transformation, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interaction of A, B, and the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). The compounded effect of these transformations influences the trajectory and final position.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
