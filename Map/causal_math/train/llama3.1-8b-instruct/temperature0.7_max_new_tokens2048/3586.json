  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = pz' + qz \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants and \\\\( z' \\\\) is the derivative of \\\\( z \\\\) with respect to time.\n\nCan we deduce the original function behavior \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 to t = T from observing \\\\( Lz(t) \\\\) over the same interval without prior knowledge of whether any transformations beyond \\\\( L \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specifics of potential modifications by transformations other than \\\\( L \\\\) or without precise characterizations of initial derivatives, it's impossible to confidently trace back to the exact behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) merely from knowing \\\\( Lz(t) \\\\). The transformation through \\\\( L \\\\) does not preserve all original information due to the combination of the function and its derivative.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
