  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\( D \\\\) being a constant matrix characterizing the system dynamics and \\\\( C \\\\) being the control matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) is defined, where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), it is uncertain if the vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was modified initially by \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\). Thus, tracing back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without this knowledge is not feasible as the transformation could have significantly altered the starting conditions in a non-reversible way.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
