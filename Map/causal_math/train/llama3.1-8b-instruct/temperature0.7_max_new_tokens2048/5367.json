  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator equation \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\). Analyze how utilizing a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) a constant, affects the system over a time-scale \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(S(x) = e^{i\\phi}x\\\\) (where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\phi\\\\) another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\theta\\\\) or \\\\(\\phi\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both interventions, \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\), simply introduce a phase shift without altering the dynamics governed by L. Hence, the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depends solely on the scaling factor \\\\(e^{\\lambda T}\\\\) determined by L, despite the phase shifts introduced by \\\\(\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(\\phi\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
