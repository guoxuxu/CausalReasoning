  "Problem": "We are investigating the temperature dynamics in a material described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Consider the effect of a thermal control method described by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the scaling imposed by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\), the original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) could be misconceived due to the altered exponential factor. Any initial condition scaled differently by the exponential factor can lead to the observed state at t = T, hence making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( u_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
