  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the influence of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), represented by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is applied intermittently.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the function by integrating its past states altered by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{B(s-t)} \\\\). This alteration affects the subsequent evolution under \\\\( A \\\\), leading to a different trajectory and state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
