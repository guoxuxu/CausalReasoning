  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( dz/dt = Hz \\\\), where H is a Hermitian matrix. An intervention is applied to the system using a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), with K being a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initialized at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolves under \\\\( dz/dt = Hz \\\\) for a period T without any further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if the initial state had not been \\\\( z_0 \\\\) but instead \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\) at the initial point changes the state of the system, adding a phase shift dependent on K, which modifies the trajectory dictated by H. As H and K might not commute, their exponential effects are not interchangeable, leading to different states at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
