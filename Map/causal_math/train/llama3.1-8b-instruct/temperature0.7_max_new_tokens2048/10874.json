  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature inside a chamber, denoted as T(t), evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T_a - T)\\\\), with T_a being the ambient temperature and k a positive constant. An intervention is introduced by adjusting T_a through a function \\\\( f(t) = T_a + \\\\Delta T_a \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), modifying the ambient temperature periodically.\n\nGiven the temperature T(t) at some time t without any knowledge of interventions, can we deduce the initial ambient temperature T_a0?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on the time evolution of T or possible variations in T_a, multiple different initial conditions T_a0 and T(0) could lead to the same observed temperature T(t), making unique determination of T_a0 impossible from T(t) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
