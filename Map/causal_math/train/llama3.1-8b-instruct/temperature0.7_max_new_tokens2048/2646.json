  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving over time according to their respective differential equations, \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied for causal analysis.\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) for a certain s, can we uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) encapsulates the entire timeline of the system's evolution in a compressed, integral form. As such, it loses certain specific details about initial conditions due to the integration over time, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alone without additional constraints or assumptions about the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
