  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\) that changes u from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.\n\nIs it possible to deduce which transformations (Fourier, Laplace, or none) were applied during the evolution of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) up to a time T, only by analyzing the state and without additional data about the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of different transformations can mimic each other or interfere in ways that make unambiguous identification challenging. Even with comprehensive frequency or complex-plane data at time T, distinguishing which specific transformations were applied at earlier times requires additional context beyond the scope of the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
