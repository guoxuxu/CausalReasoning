  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{(i \\\\omega + a)t} \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, does the Laplace transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) still depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{(i \\\\omega + a)t} \\\\), and its Laplace transform becomes \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega - a} \\\\). This transformed function now depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\), indicating a dependency beyond just \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
