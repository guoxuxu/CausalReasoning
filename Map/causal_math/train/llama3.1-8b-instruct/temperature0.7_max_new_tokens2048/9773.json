  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system that filters an input signal x(t) using a transfer function H(s). We examine how impulse response h(t), which is the inverse Laplace Transform of H(s), affects the output y(t) of the system.\n\nIf an input signal x_0(t) is provided at t = 0, and the system is left to operate with its intrinsic transfer function H(s) without further modification, will the output y(t) at t = T be solely determined by the impulse response h(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The output y(t) is the convolution of the input x_0(t) with the impulse response h(t), representing the system's reaction to the input under the influence of H(s). Hence, without any intervention, the output at t = T is determined by the impulse response applied to the input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
