  "Problem": "Examine the linear system driven by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. Consider the complex function transformation \\\\(h(x) = S \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)x\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and the system is then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for a specific \\\\(T > 0\\\\) be identical to the evolution of \\\\(x_0\\\\) under the same system but without applying \\\\(h(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\(S\\\\exp(i\\\\omega \\\\cdot 0)x_0 = Sx_0\\\\), altering the trajectory of the system from this new initial condition. The difference in initial states causes divergence in the subsequent state evolution under the matrix \\\\(M\\\\), leading to a distinct state at any time \\\\(T\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
