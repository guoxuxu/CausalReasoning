  "Problem": "Consider a physical system under the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 \\\\phi = \\\\rho\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is the potential field and \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the charge density. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform to both sides of the equation in the context of changing system conditions.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) after an intervention affecting charge distribution, can we determine if the modification in \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) was due to this specific intervention or natural system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) reveals changes in the potential field, distinguishing between alterations caused by external interventions or by natural system dynamics requires additional context or information. The transform itself does not provide definitive information about the origin of the modifications in \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
