  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. We examine the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) to the system, where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nConsidering the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), by only examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the interactions of the exponential transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) with the natural system dynamics, multiple combinations of A, B and initial conditions could yield the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, it's impossible to uniquely identify which transformations were applied based solely on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
