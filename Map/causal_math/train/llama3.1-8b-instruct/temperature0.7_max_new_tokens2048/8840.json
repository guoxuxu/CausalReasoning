  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on the solution.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to accurately determine which transformations (\\\\( T[z] \\\\), \\\\( U[z] \\\\), or both) were applied during the timeline, solely by analyzing the state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied to reach \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complicated due to the possibility of different orders and types of transformations yielding overlapping or similar results, given the non-linear and cumulative nature of these integral transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
