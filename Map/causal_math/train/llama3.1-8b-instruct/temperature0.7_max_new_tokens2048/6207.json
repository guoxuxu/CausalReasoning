  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear time-invariant differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix representing the system's dynamics and \\\\(N\\\\) is a control matrix. The control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\( h(u) = e^{Kt}u \\\\) over time t, where \\\\(K\\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a manipulation \\\\( v(y) = e^{Lt}y \\\\) (where \\\\( L \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied directly to the state, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( K \\\\) or \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the state intervention \\\\( v(y) \\\\) changes the course of the state dynamics, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) influenced by both the transformation effects of \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\), in addition to the inherent system dynamics described by \\\\( M \\\\). The trajectory will be significantly affected by the composite influence of these matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
