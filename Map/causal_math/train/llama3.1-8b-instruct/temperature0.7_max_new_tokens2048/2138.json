  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the properties of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f](s) \\\\) of this function, given for a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nKnowing the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f](s) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the value of \\\\( s \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion of the Laplace transform is not unique without additional constraints or information. Multiple values or regions of \\\\( s \\\\) could potentially yield the same transformation result without specification of initial or boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Knowledge of Laplace transform → Knowledge of f(z); Knowledge of f(z) → Value of z; Value of z → Value of s"
