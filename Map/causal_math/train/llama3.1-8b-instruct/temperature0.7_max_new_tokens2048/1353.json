  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates over time. We study the effect of a Laplace Transform \\\\( F(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(p) \\\\) which transforms the complex-valued function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf the initial complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) includes a sudden change in behavior at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and then continuously evolves, will the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) reflect this sudden change without further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is sensitive to all discontinuities and changes in the behavior of the original function. Thus, a sudden change at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will be manifested in the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) through alterations in pole and zero placements or discontinuities in the derivative of \\\\( F(p) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "sudden change in z(t) → change in x(t); sudden change in z(t) → change in y(t); change in x(t) → change in F(p); change in y(t) → change in F(p); change in F(p) → change in the transformed function"
