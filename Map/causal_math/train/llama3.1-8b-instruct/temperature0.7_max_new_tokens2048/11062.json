  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We study the effect of a linear transformation of variables defined by the matrix \\\\( T = \\\\begin{pmatrix} P & Q \\\\\\\\ R & S \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), applied initially at time t = 0.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can one accurately ascertain the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), it is not possible to accurately trace back to the exact initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The transformation could have modified the initial conditions in a way that is indistinguishable from other potential initial states due to non-reversible modifications imposed by T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
