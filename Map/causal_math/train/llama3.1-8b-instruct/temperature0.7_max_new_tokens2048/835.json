  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to an initial complex value \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\). We analyze the transformation and evolution over time t where complex rotations represent the system's dynamics.\n\nIf at a time t = \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\), a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}i}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) exactly equal -i, assuming the original \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) continues afterwards?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\) results in \\\\( z(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}) = e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}i} \\\\). Applying \\\\( g \\\\), we have \\\\( g(z(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2})) = e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}i}e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}i} = i^2 = -1 \\\\). Continuing from \\\\( t = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\) to t = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) results in \\\\( z(\\\\pi) = -i \\\\), since \\\\( e^{i\\\\pi} = -1 \\\\) acts on -1.",
