  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a wave propagating in space and time. We analyze this system after performing a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to the frequency domain.\n\nIf the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) undergoes an additional transformation, say a filtering process represented by multiplication with \\\\( e^{-ak^2t} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant), will the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on the original equation and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filtering process significantly affects the system's dynamics. It alters the frequency components of the solution, making the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) dependent not only on the initial equation but also on the characteristics of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
