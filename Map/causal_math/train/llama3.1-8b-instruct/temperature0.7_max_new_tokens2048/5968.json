  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system described by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is defined in the complex domain. Let's analyze an intervention using an inverse mapping \\\\( g(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)] \\\\) where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is another complex function.\n\nGiven the observed output transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), and knowing that an intervention \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied at some point, can we unequivocally determine the specifics of the intervention \\\\( H(s) \\\\) along with the original function \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the original function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) just from the final observed transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) can be extremely challenging. The resulting transform could be a result of various potential interactions and convolutions, rendering the isolation of individual contributions ambiguous without additional constraints or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
