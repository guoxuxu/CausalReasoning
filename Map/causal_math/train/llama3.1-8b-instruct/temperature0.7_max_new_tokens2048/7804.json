  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) representing the solution to a system of linear differential equations with a matrix A. An external operator modifies the trajectory through a time-dependent matrix transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to ascertain which transformations (\\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or neither) were applied during the evolution, just by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of matrix exponentiation in the transformations \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) = e^{Ct} \\\\) can overlap, and without additional information about the commuting properties or specific behaviors of \\\\( A, B, \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), it is not feasible to uniquely determine which transformations, if any, were applied throughout the timeline.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
