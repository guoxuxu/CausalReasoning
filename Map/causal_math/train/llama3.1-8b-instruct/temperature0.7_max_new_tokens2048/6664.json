  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) that is subjected to an integral transformation defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable. This transformation transforms the function from the time domain to the frequency domain. We explore how manipulating the function directly or its transform can affect causal inference.\n\nKnowing the final transformed function \\\\( Z''(s) \\\\) after undisclosed interventions involving exponential time-domain manipulations, can we definitively identify the specific interventions (values of a and b) used?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed result \\\\( Z''(s) \\\\) may suggest shifts in the transform domain, but different combinations of values for a and b can yield the same overall effect (e.g., shifts by the same combined amount). Thus, without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely determine the exact interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
