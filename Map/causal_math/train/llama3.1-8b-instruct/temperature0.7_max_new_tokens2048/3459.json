  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The function maps to the transformation with integral transformation operator \\\\( T \\) defined as \\\\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf we intervene by altering \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to a new value \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and then apply \\\\( T \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) reflect this change?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the angular frequency in \\\\( z(t) = x e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\). Therefore, the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will involve contributions from both the initial and altered frequencies, making it dependent on \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
