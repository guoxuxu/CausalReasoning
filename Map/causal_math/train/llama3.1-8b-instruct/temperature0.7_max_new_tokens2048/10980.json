  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are functions of time, t, subject to a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) with constant matrices A and B. The function z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the complex state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine the sequence of transformations (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) used, solely based on \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially have been reached through various paths involving different combinations or sequences of the transformations T and U. The effects of linear transformations and the dynamics introduced by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) could yield the same endpoint from different initial conditions and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
