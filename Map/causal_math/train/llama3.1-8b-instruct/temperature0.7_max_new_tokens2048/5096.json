  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit comprising an inductor \\(L\\), capacitor \\(C\\), and resistor \\(R\\), governing the charge \\(Q\\) on the capacitor. The dynamics of \\(Q\\) are described by the second-order differential equation \\(L \\ddot{Q} + R \\dot{Q} + \\frac{Q}{C} = 0\\). We examine the effect of a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) introduced into the circuit at different times.\n\nGiven the observed charge \\(Q(T)\\) at time \\(T\\), can we determine exactly whether a resistance change occurred at a prior time \\(t_1\\), and if \\(V(t)\\) was applied at \\(t = 0\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of initial conditions, variations in resistance, and timings of external voltage application can yield the same observed charge \\(Q(T)\\). The overlap in potential charge trajectories and responses due to parameter changes and external forcing creates ambiguity in identifying specific interventions and initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
