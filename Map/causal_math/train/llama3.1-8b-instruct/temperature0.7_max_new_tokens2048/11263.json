  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the Laplace Transform on a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) that is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial t^2} = -\\\\alpha^2 h \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. The scenario investigates how transformations influence the solution and inference of initial conditions or operations on the function.\n\nIf an additional damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant, is introduced at \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) and the subsequent transform is taken, will the final Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{-\\\\beta t}h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) rely solely on the original differential equation's constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) without influence from \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying the damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\) introduces an additional parameter that impacts the system behavior, which consequently affects the Laplace Transform. The transformed function will now depend both on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), as the damping factor alters the effective decay and oscillatory characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
