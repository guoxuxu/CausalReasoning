  "Problem": "Consider a physical scenario where heat propagation in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity. We analyze the system's response to a time-dependent boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) is applied at one end of the rod at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) without further intervention, will the heat distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t > 0 be solely determined by this initial boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "The boundary condition initiates a specific thermal gradient along the rod that evolves according to the heat equation. Given the condition at one boundary and assuming initial conditions elsewhere (e.g., initially uniform temperature), the solution to the heat equation at any subsequent time is uniquely determined by this boundary condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
