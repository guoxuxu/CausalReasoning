  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a diffusion constant. Evaluate how the Laplace transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), influences the behavior of the solution.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transformation to the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), assuming \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), affect the values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > 0 \\\\) when evaluated under the original partial differential equation without further processing?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform applied to the initial condition serves to aid in analytical solutions but does not alter the actual behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the prescribed dynamics of the differential equation. The transformation is purely mathematical and does not affect physical properties or evolution of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
