  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the function transforms under the operation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(s) ds \\\\), which is integrated over the time interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf the final computed value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after application of an unknown intervention is known, can we unequivocally deduce the nature and timing of the intervention (change in frequency at \\\\( t_1 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention from the final value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone is challenging due to multiple potential intervention scenarios (different \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) or \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) yielding similar integral values. The exact nature and timing of the intervention require additional information beyond the integral's final value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
