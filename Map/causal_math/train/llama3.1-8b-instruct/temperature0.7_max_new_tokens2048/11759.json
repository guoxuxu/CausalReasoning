  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the harmonic oscillator equations \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant. We explore how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which transforms a function into its frequency components, affects the inference capabilities within the system dynamics.\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we deduce exactly what interventions occurred (i.e., whether a damping factor was applied, and what value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) was used) along with the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the modified signal will provide frequency component information and amplitude adjustments but cannot definitively reveal whether these changes stem from the intervention alone or combinations of intrinsic characteristics and interventions. Multiple settings of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and initial conditions might yield similar transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
