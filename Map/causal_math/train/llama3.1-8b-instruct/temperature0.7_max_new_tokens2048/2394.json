  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We investigate the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\) on the function over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) exactly after observing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the specific form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a purely exponential function like \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a distinct frequency spike (delta function) at \\\\( \\omega \\). Thus, observing the Fourier transform allows us to exactly deduce that the original function was indeed \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), given the characteristic nature of this transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
